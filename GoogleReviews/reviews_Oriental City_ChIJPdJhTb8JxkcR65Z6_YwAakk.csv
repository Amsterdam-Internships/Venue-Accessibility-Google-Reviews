There are other dishes to enchant your taste buds! But be aware! You might want to reserve a table upfront if you don‚Äôt want to queue for it!"
1,Oriental City, 4 stars ,a month ago,It was quite crowded on the weekend. They had good choices of Dim Sum with reasonable price (compared to the size). Staff were friendly and helpful.
2,Oriental City, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very nice experience here. Excited to find such a place for Cantonese cuisine in Amsterdam! It has been my second time here(will come often in the future:)))).

5,Oriental City, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Impressed! I didn't expect that it is soooo delicious. For a restaurant in the center of Amsterdam, a place full of tourists. But the stir fried rice noodle is even more tasty then the one I had in Shantou, Guangdobg where it is origined from. Nice location, good view, tasty food. Exceptionally nice food to me, a Chinese."
6,Oriental City, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"The food was amazing, the staff rather stressed out. We didn‚Äòt feel very welcome as we entered the restaurant on a sunday afternoon. It was pretty packed and we didn‚Äòt reserve a table, so we got sent up to the second floor where there were ‚Ä¶"
7,Oriental City, 4 stars ,3 months ago,A Chinese restaurant famous for the dim sums so we came try it out. As a Cantonese I was kind of disappointed cuz the dishes were mediocre. But it‚Äôs ok to eat there when you crave for some dim sums. The squid cakes are really good though.

21,Oriental City, 5 stars ,7 months ago,We have been here 2 times during the trip in Amsterdam. I have to say the restaurant is the best Chinese restaurant I have been in Europe.
22,Oriental City, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The most authentic Cantonese restaurant with the best dim sum in Amsrerdam. I have been living in the city for around 4 years and this is the most often restarutant i would visit for Dim dum. My favourite film ""young and dangerous"" also shot the scene there, making me feel like going back to the scene of the film 25 years ago!"
23,Oriental City, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Have been here many times with many expats and absolutely love it. The best choice is dim sum for lunch hands down. I have kept a detailed list of our favorites as the choice is huge: 218, 220, 231, 232, 233, 246, 253, 255, 215 (a little ‚Ä¶"
24,Oriental City, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Take away review, heard Oriental City is sharing the same owner as Fulu Mandarijn at Rokin. Like Fulu so try the take away from Oriental City, add one more star because take away arrived warm, deep fried fish was still crispy, with free red bean tarts."

28,Oriental City, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Good dim sum restaurant but unfortunately always busy, and this has an impact on the quality of the service and, sometimes, also on the quality of the food. In general a good place to stop for a bite on the hedge of the red lights district."
29,Oriental City, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Been coming here for more than 20 years and I still haven‚Äôt had enough. The dimsum has changed a bit, but in a good way. It‚Äôs more expensive than it was but the dimsum is bigger, full of flavor, and with big prawns inside. Worth the money. Due to Corona, be sure to make a reservation."
30,Oriental City, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good food. Always very busy. But fast service.

Great dim sum"
31,Oriental City, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Quality of good greatly varied. The waitress was quite rude and unprofessional.
32,Oriental City, 4 stars ,a month ago,Not for vegetarians. We had a friendly staff member but the others are not so friendly. If you eat meat and fish you will have a good meal. If you are vegetarian don't go.

35,Oriental City, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great location, service could be improved. I'd rate it a close second to New King though!"
36,Oriental City, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Always good quality dimsum, we had delivery in the weekend and it was delivered on time. We like the roasted duck, fish and rice sheet rolls, actually all the dimsum food was excellent! One of the best dimsum restaurants in Amsterdam, also many Asian customers appreciate the food here."
37,Oriental City, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,We always eat lunch here when we go to Amsterdam. It is always very good.
38,Oriental City, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"A gem in the city for Chinese Dim Sum .
A must if you are in town for a short trip or on holidays . Best in town . This is where we always had our dim sum for more than 30 years .
I recommend this dim sum restaurant to everyone ."
39,Oriental City, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I was half an hour earlier than my reservation but they accommodated me and let me in which was brilliant. Food was served quite fast. I must say that their dim sums are considered big in size. In Asia the dim sums are smaller in size. Taste is good. Will definitely be back as I haven't savoured the rest of the menu.
40,Oriental City, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Not worth the fuss, food is pretty ok too much oil for me though, but service isn't the best"

46,Oriental City, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,They give you the authentic experience of getting barked at by the waitress. Just like in Asia. ‚Ä¶
47,Oriental City, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had a great time at Oriental City. Their Dim Sum are tasty and the service was fast. Price is OK. Make a reservation if you want to be seated quickly. I went there at noon on a sunday and the place was packed.
48,Oriental City, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"I knew Amsterdam was expensive compared to the rest of the country, but charging EUR 9,90 voor Ha Kau (4pcs) these days, even if it's due to inflation, is quite a price hike. I'll go to Den Haag, because a yamcha lunch costs 30% less, sorry."
49,Oriental City, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food was decent, but the dining experience was completely ruined at the end by the waiter who very rudely demanded a tip.  Management really needs to train their staff to refine their behavior and not hustle customers for tips.  A nice restaurant can be ruined by such shameful behavior of the staff."
50,Oriental City, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Great genuine Chinese restaurant, located just behind Damrak on the first canal on the corner. Food is delicious and as good as one can order in Hong Kong, because the majority staff in kitchen and service originate from Hong Kong. A good ‚Ä¶"
51,Oriental City, 2 stars ,4 months ago,The pork was cold and seemed to be raw in the middle. The best from the dish was rice with sauce. I believe the price was adequate to the quality of the food in Centre of Amsterdam. Would not recommend.
52,Oriental City, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was amazing but their service is very poor. We been there and waiting to order at least 20 min. After order they provide timely. Test of the food quite ok. Pleasant environment with big sitting arrangement. Many Chinese people you find ‚Ä¶
53,Oriental City, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I've been going to this place for years now, especially for Dim Sum (traditional Chinese brunch, served only on Sunday from a special menu). Started to go with a Chinese friend because she was positive that this was the best Dim Sum place ‚Ä¶"
54,Oriental City, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was excellent. I had the shrimp dumplings and the duck with pancakes. I also ordered a 2014 Bordeaux wine, which was fantastically priced at ‚Ç¨50. The wine was excellent and the food was a nice compliment. The waiter was very ‚Ä¶"
55,Oriental City, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tradition dimsum, as good as the taste quality in Hong kong. The queue on weekend is long, i went there on sunday, table for 2 at 11:50 need more than 40min of queue, We left and return on monday. Price is fare, certain item is more pricy.... nice service"
56,Oriental City, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Total disappointment, I wish we had chosen a different restaurant on our short stay in Amsterdam.
Menu was unclear and confusing and didn't match with the website. ‚Ä¶"
57,Oriental City, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited the restaurant in a party of 4, two of which were vegetarians. The food tasted nice but for the vegetarians there were only a few options, one of those happened to be out of stock too which limited our options further. Overall okay experience but wouldn‚Äôt suggest to a party with vegetarians."
58,Oriental City, 1 star ,6 months ago,Food is disaster compared with other Chinese restaurants. Never eat it again . ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
59,Oriental City, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Average food, not cheap, but the price is also average in Amsterdam. It‚Äôs a city for tourists, so you can hardly find a place to eat proper food with reasonable price."
60,Oriental City, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great location, service, and menu. Really good taste and quality food. View is awesome too. I could've sit there for hours. Will be back. Lamb and Prawn dumplings were extraordinary tasty. Pineapple chicken was so alright. Menu has many choices, we wanted to try something which this restaurant is famous for."
61,Oriental City, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great food and service as always. Honestly, we found it a little overpriced, otherwise 5 stars."
62,Oriental City, 5 stars ,5 months ago,I'm updating my review and giving it another star. I ordered for the 3rd time (delivery) and this was one of the best meals I've ever had delivered. Although delivery is not a fair representation of a restaurant (or full) this was really ‚Ä¶
63,Oriental City, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best dim sum in the town! Have been here several times for lunch, normally very busy and have to wait for seats. Dim sum is always tasty, and the window view is superb! Nowadays they become more creative with decoration. It is a place I will always go with my friends."
64,Oriental City, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best Chinese restaurants in Amsterdam - with an extensive Dim Sum card  for the afternoon  (stuff that is not served in late afternoon and the evenings) very popular with Chinese tourists and the locals alike....
65,Oriental City, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Old school Hong Kong style dim sum restaurant. Old school means food is authentic, but also means minimum service, noisy ambiance and less clean facilities, just like a restaurant in Hong Kong back to the 1990‚Äôs.  Focus on the food, keep an open heart to others things."
66,Oriental City, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"For its central location and 3 floors of sitting area, its good. Prices are average and the dim sum itself was ok. Not the best in Amsterdam and not unique either. Quite a busy restaurant so expect directness from staff and lack of patience ‚Ä¶"
67,Oriental City, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,Food is good but not exceptional. Staff could be a little more friendly.
68,Oriental City, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good dim sum and authentic Cantonese dishes sich as char siu or roast duck. Good Hongkonese mil tea. The service is not as welcoming as you might expect. Prices are on the upside.
69,Oriental City, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty and it's real Chinese taste restaurant, not the western style Chinese food. Can get the suitable suggestions of dishes from the waiter."
70,Oriental City, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"For chinese food and dimsum! The roasted set is good, fish is decent. Staff were friendly, service was fast"
71,Oriental City, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Went here with my family. It's a good place for Chinese food. I am used to have good Chinese food in Shanghai and Seoul, and the food here is quite acceptable. Although I can't say this place is one of the best, soup/dimsum/noodle/fried&marinated pork dishes were delicious and were appropriately salty."
72,Oriental City, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We were touring around the city when we stumbled upon this restaurant with so many people on queue. Since we were also hungry, we decided to get inside. Just a heads up, the waiting time is no less than 15 minutes to get on your table. It's ‚Ä¶"

97,Oriental City, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food here is mediocre at best, and tries to pass off as a Chinese restaurant. It didn't feel like they put any soul into cooking and was more interested in dishing out dishes that were poor imitations of what proper delicious Chinese food was like. Felt like a lot of MSG and not much depth in authentic flavours."

215,Oriental City, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic place for wonton  soup.  Also the dishes are quite authentic chinese.  They have changed the menu recently for the worse unfortunately.

281,Oriental City, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We only visited here once. As tourist, we looked in and used our instinct about this place. Average size portions (although we feel that the locals get a bigger portion to us), lousy service, food merely average. Will not go back."
282,Oriental City, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We were so hungry and came in here on a lunch time. We got lovely chines food for fun money! I advice this place. Fast, cheap and tasty!"
283,Oriental City, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Bad restaurant!! The service was awfull! We get the duck dish which was recommended us - it was dry and uneaten!! Even not single staff ask us why we didn't eat it.
Do not go !!!!"
284,Oriental City, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and nice waiters. However there's a chance you have to wait on the staircase for a seat because it's really popular amongst locals
285,Oriental City, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"In my opinion the place to get the best dimsum in Amsterdam. While it pales compared to dimsum restaurants in Utrecht and Den Haag, it stands heads and shoulders above the rest with the exception of Sea Palace, which is also one of my favourite!"
286,Oriental City, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food, great service. Everything about this place speaks quality. Highly recommended."
287,Oriental City, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Bad service, with expensive and bad quality of food. With the price, it is lack of details and passion. Don't go to try if u never been, there are way better Chinese restaurants around there. ‚Ä¶"
288,Oriental City, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A surprise you will find near by the red light district in Amsterdam. A chinese restaurant serving many kind of delicious dishes. Friendly and helpful staff.
289,Oriental City, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was really meh. Some of the items we ordered were ok but a few were really bad, service was slow and we waited a long time to order. Definitely over hyped place."
290,Oriental City, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went in May 2019, great food, great service!

By far the best restaurant I have ever stumbled upon."
291,Oriental City, 4 stars ,5 years ago,I only come here for their dim sum it's really worth it trying it out if you don't mind the waiting (which sometimes can take up to 45 mins when they are busy). Not cheap and not always friendly waiters/waitresses.
292,Oriental City, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The taste is exactly the same as the dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong! I go to this place almost every month, absolutely love it!"
293,Oriental City, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best dim sum in Amsterdam! Service is fast and good, ambiance is not my cup of tea but the food definitely makes up for that."
294,Oriental City, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Not bad food but quite pricey for what you get. Local Chinese food at home is just as good if not better at at least half the price.
295,Oriental City, 1 star ,2 years ago,Can you believe the waitress asked us to pay soon and leave soon? ( our dinner took a bit more than 1 hour which I believe it‚Äôs normal)

297,Oriental City, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food is not bad but some waiters are really really RUDE! The guy who charged us is in a very terrible attitude.
298,Oriental City, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Their Dim Sum cannot be beat and you should not pass this place by. It dits on the edge of the Red Light District and is very easy to find. P
299,Oriental City, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"5 stars for the dim sum, 3 stars for the a la carte. The quality of the dim sum is exceptional but the dinner is just ok, nothing exceptional."

307,Oriental City, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very nice staff and food
308,Oriental City, 5 stars ,3 years ago,As usual dissum is better than in Hong Kong it's self. Down side was having to wait 2 hours. But worth the wait. YOU HAVE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS IN THE WEEKEND!
309,Oriental City, 1 star ,2 years ago,Absolutely HORRIBLE experience! The food is just okay with outrageous prices...the worst is the staff extremely rude and unhelpful. The worst experience in Amsterdam! Stay away from this place
