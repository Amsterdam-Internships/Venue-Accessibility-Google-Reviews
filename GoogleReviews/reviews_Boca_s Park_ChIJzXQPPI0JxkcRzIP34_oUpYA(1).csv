0,Boca's Park, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The trio fries are amaze-balls! Had those and the vegetarian platter (small) for 2, which was more than enough. Finished with the Nutella pizza, but grossly disappointed by the size of that. Also, strawberries weren't in season back then so they were more sour than sweet. Maybe stick to seasonal fruit?"

3,Boca's Park, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for casual drinks and snacks. Located in a vibey area, close to a park and other nice shops. Food was good - great variety of tapas and nice wine selection for reasonable prices."
4,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We loved the place. It ambience was warm and cosy and had candle lights. The food was delicious. Just loved the shakshuka there
5,Boca's Park, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Came for a coffee on the weekend. Service was quite slow and coffees were mediocre. Also the whole place smelled like chlorine from cleaning. I've been other times for drinks and it was a better atmosphere.
6,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely restaurant, perfect for sharing a meal in the heart of the Pijp. Tasty food, great platters and cosy setting! Slightly slow service, but Had a great time."
7,Boca's Park, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Draft beer was disappointed. We tried 2 of them and both were not good taste. Even we could recognize as the beer we order. Food it is so spicy, if you like it is your place if not then you gonna need to go another place. Service was good and all bartenders where there when you need them."
8,Boca's Park, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good location for lunch on a sunny day. Sandwiches are small, which is fine because the concept is about making you taste a few small ones at the same time, but you need to order at least 3 for a proper lunch. Service was nice. Wine was decent."
9,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food - love the French onion soup that's full of flavor. Wine was good. The staff was generally helpful and attentive, the atmosphere and setting very cozy, especially with it raining outside. Spent a good hour and a half writing ‚Ä¶"

11,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Ate mushrooms at the van Gogh museum and somehow ended up here. Food was delicious.
12,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best restaurant in the world. Really nice to go eat there with your girlfriend,familie or friends. The food was served fast and was finger licking good. Also the guys who were cooking are really nice guys and they know how to cook.
I recommend this restaurant to anyone. See you guys again."
13,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We loved this place. It's got a fantastic, cozy ambience and the service is very friendly. Prices are quite reasonable and the food delicious. Great place to chill on a rainy afternoon."
14,Boca's Park, 4 stars ,4 years ago,These little sandwiches are delicious.  You can't go wrong with any of the beef options.  Love the cheese and fig jam as well.  My only disappointment is the size of the sandwiches relative to the price - 3-4 euros is a bit steep for these bite sized treats.
15,Boca's Park, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The platters are a must with a big group and best to reserve a spot on weekends
16,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice staff and a cosy place. Lovely sandwiches. I will come here again.
17,Boca's Park, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I have pretty reasonable expectations of service, but this place was a joke.  They were only moderately busy. After being walked past 4 times by 2 different waitstaff we asked if we could seat ourselves, we could live with that.  We then ‚Ä¶"
18,Boca's Park, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Just the worst service I have ever received. I was shocked. Not only did three tiny sandwiches take ages to arrive, even though there were no more than two other tables. The waiter was horribly rude to me when we paid the bill. Sighing when ‚Ä¶"
19,Boca's Park, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is nice and warm.
But it's really small to have this order at the counter by your self system. Next to that the prices are really over the top considering what you get. ‚Ä¶"
20,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Literally the best place to have a bite while your tour in amsterdam. First it's in a very trendy young place called sarphatipark. They have those plates where you can find nearly every delicious taste possible, better you share it with a friend/partner. Same with desserts (see the photos) and service is great too! Highly recommended!"
21,Boca's Park, 1 star ,2 years ago,The ‚Äòoven baked peach with amareto‚Äô is unexpectedly bad. The name sound promising but the peaches are just a bit roasted in the oven with sone crumble (very little).
22,Boca's Park, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good and delicious food and drinks! Price a bit to high for the portion but it was so good thats ok ;)

27,Boca's Park, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Perfect spot to go to with friends for shared dining! Order a plate with meat, veggies and fish and I'm sure you're going to stuff your face ;-). Delicious and cheap!"
28,Boca's Park, 1 star ,4 years ago,Our waiter was by far the rudest individual I‚Äôve met while living in Amsterdam.  The fact that he‚Äôs in the service industry is a joke.  Ruined our afternoon.
29,Boca's Park, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice idea, but too much expensive for what you get. You pay for the ""cozy place"". An experience. Once. Just to say ""Yes, I went there""."
30,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, great music, great food! Would recommend to all young tourists!!"
31,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good shared dining. Friendly staff and decent pricing. How it should be!

33,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Lovely staff - not a very common thing in Amsterdam. Also fries are really good :)
34,Boca's Park, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The sharing platters are heavenly - two small ones are plenty for two people.
