0,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"We live round the corner and love to come here to have our breakfast: croissants & coffee in a nice atmosphere, served by sweet persons."
1,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Went there for a tea after shopping. Couldn‚Äôt resist the lovely pastries. The staff is super friendly. Thank you all!
2,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,Cozy with a nice interior setup for gathering with friends or do some work in a corner. Friendly staff and inviting array of wines hovering above the bar.
3,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a very good Buscaglione coffee in the classy and stylish context of ""Blend coffee and wine"".  Great place to be! Loved by remote workers that consider Blend a relaxed work environment. Camera by Lenovo: Moto G7 Power"
4,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good place to hang out. Coffee is good but the pastry does not taste like freshly baked
5,Blend Coffee and Wine, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Too expensive for nothing. We trusted them at least for the calculation of our check, but seems like they deceived us by charging ‚Ç¨8,75 for something we did NOT consume and we do not even know what it is. ALT? What does it even stand for?"
6,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Not Hipp and Great Coffee . Nice Terrace . Same service over years .
7,Blend Coffee and Wine, 1 star ,9 months ago,"We went with the rational that they only do two things, so how can it be bad. However, it was by far the worst coffee I had in years, and with a price tag about +‚Ç¨1 (per coffee) over all other specialized coffee place, our two flat whites ‚Ä¶"
8,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had here the best cappuccino of my entire life! Very very tasty and creamy. My wife had a mint tea and she liked it.
9,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great service and coffee. The breakfast was fantastic. I recommend visiting this coffee shop.
10,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice environment with tasty cappuccino ! Was expecting a little bigger piece of cake for such a price but in the end it was good ;)
11,Blend Coffee and Wine, 2 stars ,2 years ago,A large cappuccino has the size of a big espresso and the Latte taste completely like milk..
12,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Wonderful water front terrace to relax in the sun. Looks very nice inside too; beautiful wine storage and high ceilings - good vibes!
13,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice atmosphere on the terrace next to the canal. The coffee was good and medium prices
14,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place and nice view to a small canal. Many good choices for hot/cold drinks. The foods are good.
15,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing place with the most friendly employees. I arranged a small party to celebrate my wedding and everything was perfect and exactly as we discussed it in advance. Me and my friends had so much fun. I definitely recommend it even for just a coffee. The atmosphere is very cosy and relaxing.
16,Blend Coffee and Wine, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Very cosy place with good-looking interior. Could never work out the idea of this place though: it has great wines but it closes at 6 or 8 at night which is too early. It opens too early in the morning at 8 but breakfast/brunch is mediocre and overpriced.
17,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice service and somehow cozy, even with that mediocre interior. Will keep going."
18,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good coffee, great location (lots of seating, both indoor and outdoor). They sell delicious pastel de nata and staff is always extremely friendly!"
19,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Had the Memphis style BBQ rib-meat, which was very tender, excellently garnished and with a luxurious sauce. Also had lunch there once which was also great. Good selection of wine and very friendly staff. An inconspicuous place with excellent food!"
20,Blend Coffee and Wine, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Espresso is nice, but one of the most expensive around, they charged 4,25 for a doppio."
21,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A really cool spot with a lovely terrace by the water. Soup and toast ok, but the Caesar salad was kind of light (even for a small eater). Service was totally nice."
22,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place for drinks and lunch. Nice atmosphere, wilde variety of wines,lunch possibilities. Sunny terrace and acceptabele prices. A spot in Amsterdam east i would recommend."
23,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Food was tasty but serving sizes are quite small at lunch - the Ribs with BBQ sauce was tiny (but yummy) but it think that was because they cut he meat off the bones. Tasty iced tea and iced latte.
24,Blend Coffee and Wine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Epic coffee bar with friendly personnel. coffee is good, I got a decaf cappuccino and a news paper. I noticed also a fine wine collection and a great terrace."

34,Blend Coffee and Wine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best Appeltaart on my recent trip to Amsterdam.   Great place outside the main tourist areas.
35,Blend Coffee and Wine, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Great coffee but very rude and unfriendly staff.
