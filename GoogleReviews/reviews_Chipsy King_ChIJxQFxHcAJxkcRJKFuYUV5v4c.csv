0,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Good, affordable fast food. Really liked the wings. The spicing was great and they were very crispy from the outside. The kebab was really good too."
1,Chipsy King, 1 star ,3 months ago,Tried to have a meal here. Little guy with white hair at the kitchen treated us like trash because our passes were from N.A. - harassed us until some guy from the business next door explained to him what our passes were. Then proceeded to ‚Ä¶
2,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,a month ago,"The hamburger was nice, fries were not special. You could go for the hamburger-only instead of a menu."
3,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The fries are very good , so are the sauces. It's a good location and the staff is welcoming. I found the portions a little small for the price."
4,Chipsy King, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Basic quick stop for chips. Took longer than expected for something so simple but it hit the spot. Was busy around 5pm on Wednesday afternoon. Curry ketchup sauce is more ketchup than curry. Fun, tasty, and a bit gritty of an experience."
5,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I  personally liked the fries very much .
The service is not the best but it's a regular fries and not some special one."
6,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really good price, vegetarian options and super crispy fries üòÅ"
7,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Thoroughly enjoyed the Shawarma, and my partner also liked the kebab sandwich. Staff were friendly, floors and table surfaces were clean, fast and good service."
8,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect fries, polite people. You MUST go there. I recommend King size for best experience."
9,Chipsy King, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food is good and portions are big! Service on the other hand is very impolite and even rude.
10,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Best wings, and big d√∂ner reasonable price."
11,Chipsy King, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The fries are good but they charge .75 euros for katchup and .75 euros for Mayo I mean .75 for each sauce. Be aware
12,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious fries.
Amazing Durum Kebab Roll."
13,Chipsy King, 1 star ,3 years ago,We waited almost 30 minutes for the menu and if you want to use the toilet you have to pay 50 cent.
14,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good late night eats when wondering red light district
15,Chipsy King, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Horribly dry fries, almost half of my fries were stone hard. Considering the quality the place is really expensive, and the rip-off extras cost 50p each (ketchup, mayo...). Service is even worse. Best thing is the location next to the flower market."
16,Chipsy King, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Just your average place to get a quick bite to eat with some places to sit inside instead of taking your food with you. Food is okay but prices are a bit much for what you get. ‚Ä¶
17,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My friends and I went here so many times that the amount of fries we were eating became a running joke. We only had the fries, but they were hot, fresh and delicious every time. It may seem a little pricey for fries, but it's well worth it ‚Ä¶"
18,Chipsy King, 3 stars ,4 months ago,First and last time to even try this fries

22,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The BEST hot chips I have ever eaten!

The cheese sauce is amazing, I will definitely be having this again! Just a be pricey for what tou get but worth it."
23,Chipsy King, 1 star ,2 years ago,More ketchup than burger. The guy was rude and also literally eating his own dinner (from the supermarket) as he made my terrible burger and fries. Inedible food and vastly overpriced. ‚Ä¶
24,Chipsy King, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Chips were tasteless, they rely on toppings to cover up the fact the chips tasted of nothing. Customer service wasn't great. Rather unfriendly and rude. The interior wasn't very nice and there were flies where I sat, gross. There are far better independently run places in Amsterdam to eat!!"
25,Chipsy King, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The staff is unfriendly and wants to pay you more for stuff you did not order. My durum was ill prepared and the meat was cold. Furthermore the music is way to loud so you even cannot have a normal conversation.
Would not recommend it to anyone!"
26,Chipsy King, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The chips are average, but more expensive than other stores nearby.  The service is horrible and the staff is rude and vile.  It‚Äôs almost like they enjoy being nasty to customers.  Avoid this place if you can, there are normal people working in other chip stores nearby with better chips and at cheaper prices."
27,Chipsy King, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The food here is lovely and the different flavoured sauces are so nice. But felt like they didn't listen to us and got the order wrong. Also quite overpriced for what you get!!
28,Chipsy King, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The staff in the store was so rude to us. He shouted at us ‚Äòwait‚Äô when it was our turn. Aggressive and rude staff who had a bad service. You can eat fries everywhere, you have  many choices, you‚Äôd better not go here to gain a disappointed experience."
29,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great little place with super friendly staff. They sell chips and donner kebabs (chicken or lamb) and have a small selection of sauces. I opted for the lamb kebab with chips and a hot sauce and a drink deal for around 8 Euros and left a bit ‚Ä¶
30,Chipsy King, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Incredibly rude and prejudice. Seriously, go to another location, it‚Äôs a chain. My sister asked where she could get ketchup because there was none around, and they tried to make her feel terrible for asking a simple question. The guy then ‚Ä¶"
31,Chipsy King, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Almost got scammed.. we ordered one menu (9,-) and the guy at the counter said 14,- and pretended to misunderstand us while we were all speaking Dutch and being Dutch.. right üòí ‚Ä¶"
32,Chipsy King, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They are rude, unmotivated, dry and something is off about this place. They rounded prices up, when I asked why I was being overcharged they said ‚Äúcome on, it is just 1euro‚Äù, I payed my last euro to them. But hey, they could be better but their location is conventional so ppl will keep on coming."
33,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Hahahaha, let's just say the staff are really friendly and put up with a lot of weird things from tourists that just had a space brownie. If I remember correctly, those were the best fries I ever had (space brownies might have had a contribution there)."
34,Chipsy King, 1 star ,4 years ago,"What a horrible tourist trap. As a resident I am making sure I will never get back here. Super expensive, crappy fries, bad sauce and a dirty toilet that also costs. Do yourself and the people from Amsterdam a favor. Let's help these guys into bankruptcy ASAP!"
35,Chipsy King, 1 star ,4 years ago,"terrible food, there was a black hair in my turkish pizza. they said i've got to pay ‚Ç¨8 for it because the cheese was ‚Ç¨3. They started yelling at me because I didn't agree with the price and said to me i had to sit down and shut my mouth up! disrespectful"
36,Chipsy King, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst experience in my life,the place itself looks disgusting,the prices are so high for no reason.
You need to pay 50‚Ç¨ to use a dirty toilet..after I paid 10‚Ç¨ for a kebab and a sprite with small fries.
DISGUSTING!"
37,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Wonderful staff and food mmm just amazing üíöüíôüå∏ gonna come back for sure! üíô
38,Chipsy King, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I did not enjoy my meal, but that's not the reason for my rating. My rating is due to the fact that, even as a PAYING CUSTOMER, I was asked to pay an additional 50 euro-cents to use the bathroom..."
39,Chipsy King, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Me and my boyfriend got kicked out instantly, due to us holding hands. Abusive staff, not a very nice place. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place at all, the food is extremely overpriced too!"
40,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Good take away fries. Great for munchies... I really liked the garlic sauce. For a good price we got huge bag of fries with extra sauce with no extra charge!
41,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Your go-to D√∂neria in Leipzig, I saw about 4 different ones...priced are jacked up if you ask me, but you do get a good serving for your buck! If you're hungry and want a cheap option, no competition!"
42,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice chips üçü you have to try it for sure!
43,Chipsy King, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Better than McDonald when it comes to waiting and crowdness. A bit dirty on the floor and services isn‚Äôt the nicest. Food is average, fries are not excellent as you would expect in Amsterdam"
44,Chipsy King, 1 star ,5 years ago,The waiter there was so racist and he has insulted us 'I and my wife' on ethnic basis. If you are against racism please search for a better choice. Amsterdam is great city and definitely you will find a better choices.
45,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The portion is very BIG, I didn't finish my food and brought it home. They have halal certificate, so it's recommended for muslim tourists."
46,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Big sizes, good prices! :)"
47,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,6 months ago,They are fast...doners were good.
48,Chipsy King, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a large chips and beef donair.  The chips were good and freshly cooked.  The donair was good, but lacked sauce.  Still better than McDonalds!"
49,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Good food
50,Chipsy King, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice fries with a little too much sauce. I asked whether they had any vegan options and had to explain what that meansüòÖ but yes they do
51,Chipsy King, 1 star ,5 years ago,Rude. Rude. Rude. Such a lousy attitude these people have. No such words as thank you. Whatever chips they have on their shoulders need to go in the fryer! Food sucks too. Avoid shoarma in  Amsterdam.  Grease pits. All of them !

By the way the chips are awesome!"
57,Chipsy King, 1 star ,5 years ago,They ripped me off 10 euros and then told me I was wrong and then told me to go f*** myself. Thanks for ruining an otherwise amazing trip to Amsterdam you incompetent fools. If I could give you zero stars I would.
58,Chipsy King, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"good lamb kebab, sauces at table!"
59,Chipsy King, 1 star ,3 years ago,Service was shocking and the chips weren't up to scratch. Plus we weren't even offered our change just till closed and ignored. Save yourself the trip.
