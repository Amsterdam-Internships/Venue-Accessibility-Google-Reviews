0,Zouk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great music and service , delicious food üòÄ reasonable price. Thank you üåπ"
1,Zouk, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great staff - genuinely checking capacity on a Friday night.  We couldn‚Äôt get seats to sit with our friends so we had to leave.  Must be tough but well done.  Hopefully patrons are kept safe.  Shorter female head bar staff and the taller long haired bar staff.  Polite but said they could not serve us.  Ok
2,Zouk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful patio, perfect for a sunny day. Delicious food as well. Extremely juicy burger with great fresh ingredients. Soup is made daily and very tasty. And of course, cold beer. Would recommend for a relaxing lunch"
3,Zouk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This cafe has really good food and have a decent variety of beers too.
The staff is super friendly and very helpful too.
Very close to Vondelpark, it's is located in a nice area and the outdoor seating is what I would record during summer."
4,Zouk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Have nice atmosphere. Personal are ok friendly, and food wise is rather limited. You have all fried things u want, and sort of frozen pizzas. So good for a drink, food not so much."
5,Zouk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff is friendly. The service is way to slow and they attend to forget things, fries with your steak... The cocktails are not the best neither. Too large or too small no  regular size cocktails. The food is great you just have to wait longer for it."
6,Zouk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went there with my wife for quick lunch. After we ordered our food and drinks we were waiting for while for food and unfortunately waiter mix up our order. They offer us free food and drinks. Witch was great i would definitely recommend this place to everyone. 5 star service
7,Zouk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Low choice on the menu, I'd say a decent pub though not recommended for eating in as a restaurant. Only one pasta on the menu, a few pizzas, a few starters and mains. Food took ages to be delivered, we waited for over 40 minutes for 3 shared dishes. Not very impressive I'd say, did they buy it from the shop across the street?"
8,Zouk, 3 stars ,10 months ago,Not a bad place great place to chill
9,Zouk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Not the best g and t in the world and if it was I would expect it to be served in a proper glass not a picnic plastic wine cup. Music was pretty middle of the road and middle aged despite the customers being mostly female students. We didn't eat.
10,Zouk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Friendly staff (price-quality not considered),  MasterCards/VISAs accepted (a wonder in the Netherlands), works until 1 am (something absolutely impossible in Belgium), just a few different kinds of beer but those available are not bad at ‚Ä¶"
11,Zouk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice environement.
Good service.
Not an extensive menu but focalized on what they do to do it the best. ‚Ä¶"
12,Zouk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I like the place, although a bit dark inside, the outside is nice when the sun shines, with good affordable food. Recommend the fried eggs. If you go for coffee, just keep it simple"
13,Zouk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A comparatively large neighborhood bar. They have a good food menu throughout the day that includes pizza. Friendly and helpful staff.
14,Zouk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Just a very normal bar, but good for watching football on the Saturday or Sunday. The 4th star is definitely for the bitterballen. By far the best since ages!"
15,Zouk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was pretty good.
Service a bit long but okay.
Nice bar to go with friends or family with a lor of place."
16,Zouk, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Had a quick lunch hear on a wet and rainy Amsterdam Saturday. Friendly staff and prompt service. Food was tasty, but a bit weird that they don't serve hot fries!"
17,Zouk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The beer prices are good, I just took a drin there but the service was a little disappointing, we asked fot the check and never got it so we had to pay in the counter, we were on a rush. I think because of the lack of employees they had."
18,Zouk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was tasty and the atmosphere was wonderful. I just feel like they need more options on the menu, Regardless it was nice, And i recommend the Zouk Burger most of all."
19,Zouk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice & cheap place to take a drink, kind waiter and amazing music, you need to go there !"
20,Zouk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Typical 'Dutch' cuisine with burger or sateh and a beer with good outside seating when the sun is out. Not wheelchair accessible though as the bathroom is upstairs.
21,Zouk, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Zouk has been around for ages and is quite a classic. Large area both inside and out and great for groups, especially for after office drinks.."
22,Zouk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Didn't actually eat here had a few drinks late at night the bartender was super nice seems like a hip fun place

40,Zouk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"People like to party here, thus not the the most relaxed place. :)"
41,Zouk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Don't order a pizza over here, it's more like a cracker with tomato sauce and the rest of the toppings were scarce."
