3,Soup en Zo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Simple and cool place to get soup and salad. Ingredients are fresh and well used. Variety of meat and vegan/vegetarian options.
4,Soup en Zo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is a gem! I accidentally have found it while roaming around the city. What can be better than a bowl of a freshly cooked delicious soup during a rainy chilly day? Only two bowls of their soup :) Simple yet cozy interior. Highly recommend this place!
5,Soup en Zo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The soup was OK but well, it is a soup. What I didn't like was the attention of the store woman and the fact that you pay for the ""Large"" cup to get an amount of soup that would comfortably fit in a ""Small"" one."
6,Soup en Zo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Super fresh and hearty soups with multiple vegan and veggie options - Along with fresh salad & bread! Of the 4 odd years that we lived in Amsterdam, we frequented this Soup en Zo every Saturday for our soup-salad brunch as it was so close …"

11,Soup en Zo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best food ever! I am vegan and they have so many options of healthy hearty soups to choose from. Best take away option in the city. They have three locations. The spinach coconut soup is to die for so be there early to get it before it runs …

22,Soup en Zo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Had a horrific case of food poisoning after having eaten here. My friend ate the same food and was sick as well. My husband is a doctor . Symptoms of Staphylococcal infection. Salads are improperly cooled. The management denies any responsibility. Be forewarned.
