0,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This place is amazing, it changes its menu every 2 weeks. The staff was really helpful and friendly, the wine selection is awesome and the food was really tasty."
1,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Gorgeous menu, many super tastes blended in great solutions. Wine expensive but beer affordable and good. Service is very good and the chef is very kind. Nice place."
2,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a small, rather unique restaurant, with excellent (if eclectic) food, wonderful service, in a great area in the Jordaan District. They do set menu only (which changes daily), and ours came with a wonderful starter platter of some ‚Ä¶"

4,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This is the one that should deserve 10 stars instead of five! Very nice ambiance, very cheap for what you get. Personally I think some of the wines could be a bit better with some of the dishes, but this is definitely a place we would go back more often. Love it!!!"
5,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love the atmosphere at this place. Great food! If you want something closer to fine dining but not too pretentious, this is the place to go."
6,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What a delicious experience. Menu changes every few weeks, staff is knowledgeable and the food is incredible."
7,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent place, friendly and helpful staff, great food with surprising combinations. It's small and cozy and the owner walks around for a chat and a tip. Located in great street with lots of nice boutique shops close by."
8,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing restaurant. The menu is already decided and the only thing you choose is fish/meat. Great quality. Highly recommended
9,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favourite restaurants in Amsterdam. I first discovered Balthazar's Keuken several years ago and I'm glad that the quality of the food, the creative use of local seasonal ingredients, have always been top notch. Prices are reasonable, menu non-complicated and service excellent. Oh and the portions are perfect."
10,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of our favorite meals in Amsterdam! The menu changes often (I think every week or so). They serve 5 small plates to start, a choice of main courses, and a dessert. The restaurant is cozy and staff are great!"
11,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It was definitely different, very nice looking place √†nd good service, the food was nice but not WOW, pr√©sentation wise very nice, taste wise I think we had greater expectations, but it's a place where you definitely have to go at least once and give it a try! The menu changes every two weeks more or less!"
12,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Absolutely delicious. Long story short, we had had a bad day. We came into Balthazar‚Äôs simply because we had made a reservation a few days ago and wanted to keep it. The excellent service and wine slowly brought us out of our bad mood. ‚Ä¶"

14,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"All courses were perfect, professional and kind service, nice wine selection, cool interior."
15,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"If the service had been a little faster, this would have been one of the very best food experience I have had. Pigeon breast was perfect, fixed menu meant food quality was exquisite, and the open kitchen  was both quaint and professional...we loved it!"
16,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We have really enjoyed every aspect of our dinner. The dishes were creative and flavorful. Nice atmosphere. Loved the open kitchen. The menu changes all the time. There aren‚Äôt many choices, but everything is done very well and with attention to detail. I think it‚Äôs a really good value too. Will definitely go again!"
17,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,They offer a creative 3 course set menu in a small but cozy restaurant with an open kitchen. Great value for money.
18,Balthazar's Keuken, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Disappointing, we picked a 3-4 course menu but the started was terrible. It was a cold started, and it was kept in the fridge too long and it was not fresh. The staff are nice and friendly. However, We was very shocked  by the low quality of the starter. I would like to highlight that this review is for before Covid time."
19,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place is such a lovely little surprise. The service was fantastic and very accomodating with mine & my boyfriends dietary requirements. The main course was delicious but I didn't love all the starters (the crab and the artichoke were ‚Ä¶
20,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely open kitchen type set up with set menu that was delicious. Really enjoyed the meal and setting and the wait staff were great. We ordered a bottle of wine on their recommendation but it wasn‚Äôt for us, they promptly took it away and replaced and charged us only for half the bottle. Great service."
21,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,a year ago,Daily menu that changes every two weeks. They keep their website updated so you can check the menu ;) You get all the entr√©es which were amazing. (I was happy not to have to choose just one )The only choice you need to make is main dish: ‚Ä¶
22,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,In this restaurant I had the best dinner in all of Amsterdam. Highly recommended.
23,Balthazar's Keuken, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Most disappointing dinner ever.
We went for the meat as main dish and it was gross: soft, jelly-like texture, no seasoning and on top of three ravioli; everything was drowning in butter. ‚Ä¶"
24,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Been living here a year - constantly hear this place mentioned (love their more casual sister spot Bar Parry) finally went to check it out and was disappointed. The ambiance is lovely and the staff very competent - even though I got a bit ‚Ä¶
25,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Friends raved so we tried it and it was great! Start with half dozen small plates on menu that night, then one choice- meat or fish? Everything was fresh, well balance flavor profile, pleasant and friendly young staff. Chunk of Dutch chocolate cake with coffee we ordered. Reasonable value too."
26,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good premium food. Small restaurant with a nice atmosphere. But unfortunately the staff where a little off with us, no idea why, and not so chatty; possibly not happy with serving foreign guests in a non-tourist part of the city."
27,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really enjoyed our time here - started with an appetizer which was five individual little dishes, a nice surprise.  Mains and desserts were great.  Wonderful experience for a reasonable price, will definitely be returning."
28,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,French cuisine with nice touch. Very nice service and lovely ambiance. Very highly recommended.
29,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service and very cozy atmosphere - affordable for a three course.  The set menu, though, means you're really taking a chance on all of your meal, and some offerings (quail, half lobster) simply aren't rewarding."
30,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Enjoyed my first dinner in my first trip to  Amsterdam. Great place with good services and food. The nice starters stimulate my appetite and selection of food are fresh with no much seasoning. This enhanced the real food tastes themselves. Recommended to come and try
31,Balthazar's Keuken, 2 stars ,a year ago,Unfortunately not the best experience. We had high expectations because both my fianc√© and I passed by this place every day and from outside everything looked great. The service was good and the people were actually very nice. The issue is ‚Ä¶
32,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious prix fixe dinner at really good prices ($35ish Euro/pp). Starts with a plate of different appetizers, then main course and dessert. ‚Ä¶"
33,Balthazar's Keuken, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I can't give this place a1 star because I'm not sure how the main course taste. The reason why I say this was they had us sitting around for almost an hour with no communication as to what was happening after we placed our order. It was ‚Ä¶

35,Balthazar's Keuken, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty basic French food. After hearing good things about Balthazar's, I wasn't impressed with the food they served us. Starter felt uninspired and tasted a bit plain. Main (fish) was acceptable, nothing special. The dessert was very ‚Ä¶"
36,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Outstandingly good cooking, and very good value given the high quality. Provides a set 3-course menu with choice of two main courses. The menu is beautifully constructed. There's real creativity here. Highly recommended."
37,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Friendly, informal, with really good food seemingly cooked with no stress whatsoever. And yes you are pretty much sitting in the kitchen, we certainly could see everything. You don't get much choice - fixed menu with choice of fish or meat ‚Ä¶"
38,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place was recommend to me by mutiple people  and have to say I was not disappointed. It has a changing menu so you cant predict what will be served but the setup is the same: 6 small courses to share , a fish or meat main dish and ‚Ä¶"
39,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Balthazar's is a place I'll definitely look up when back in Amsterdam, years from now. ‚Ä¶"
40,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Small place, nice staff and good food. The starters were perfect, Main course was ok. The dessert was too sweet. The price is fair, 35 for the menu + 28 for wine."
41,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Awesome food. It's a menu that changes all the time and you only choose from the fish or meat dish. Good service; we had to be a bit speedy with dinner because of a concert that night and they accomodated us.
42,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Gezellig Restaurant with, wonderful service and amazing food!  Well worth a visit!"
43,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food is amazing. Very friendly service. But the later the evening and the fuller the restaurant the service is unfortunately slowing down rapidly since there‚Äôs only two waitresses
44,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Service is not the best and food was OK. Lots of other restaurants with better vakue/service.
45,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"An excellent restaurant. They give several appetizers to share, all of which were great. I then had an incredible duck with potatoes. Highly recommend for an upscale small restaurant."
46,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This extremely cosy place has never disappointed me - great seasonal dishes, executed well and good service at a very reasonable price. Its why I keep coming back to this place!"
47,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, nice atmosphere, friendly priced,food is not amazing. Ingredients are good but the execution not. Overall an ok experience. ‚Ä¶"
48,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Loved the atmosphere and service. The chef might have had his worst night of his life or something. The food was a mess. I will probably go back to see if it is better.
49,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great concept, every dish was great. Atmosphere and vibe are excellent. The staff were friendly and helpful, highly recommended."
50,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great set menu with interesting food on the menu which I am informed changes every 2 weeks. Staff were lovely and accommodated me and the food i couldn't eat whilst pregnant
51,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food and service. Four stars because the Champagne and other sparkling wines are not refrigerated.
52,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was good but I was expecting more from here. The appetizers were the most interesting and the mains were delicious, but dessert seemed like a throw away."
53,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, very special flavours, and also very kind service. Prices are very reasonable. Best dinner we had in amstetdam!"
54,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Amazing! Balthazar's Kitchen is a wonderfully unique, little gem that presents an ever changing set menu of mouth-watering delights. The service was excellent as well. Highly recommend it!"
55,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had dinner here and really good. You only have to choose between meat or fish. Really good and recommended.
56,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing dining experience. My favorite dinner in Amsterdam. Cozy open kitchen restaurant with fixed 3 course meal.
57,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"early and late seating. karen is a wonderful owner, host and creative menu planner. we try to stop in amsterdam where ever we are traveling to stop and eat at balthzar. there is only one meat and one fish menu, but i have never been disappointed.  signed, picky eater"
58,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quality set menu based on seasonally available products, nice atmosphere, good service. popular but small so you need to book."
59,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was not particularly special. Not bad but also not outstanding. Nice atmosphere though. Restaurant is a bit small.
60,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Looks nice, I couldn't taste the food because the kitchen was already closed when we arrived, but the restaurant was actually full of people and the atmosphere was friendly and nice."

63,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Service was friendly. The food was nice. Really great value for money. It's preferable to book a table as it's seems always full.
64,Balthazar's Keuken, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Rediscovered Balthazar after not having been there for years. Concept of mixed starters, 2 main courses to choose from still works well, and the kitchen still makes original choices. We'll be back again soon now that we live in the neighborhood again"
65,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent 3 course menu where you can choose fish or meat.  Great flavours.  Friendly informative service.
66,Balthazar's Keuken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The appetizer was very delicious. What a pity that the main dish was not on the same level. All that comes in our head is 'mainstream'.
67,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Very cosy and down-to-ground place with a good serving at a reasonable price. Good athmosphere, if you don't mind sitting very close to your neighbor."
68,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"‚Ç¨19.95 for the set menu lunch, it's always something interesting and changes around, really tasty though. Not cheap but great quality"

73,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,From starter to coffee uniquely great food. Impeccable service - homely atmosphere.
74,Balthazar's Keuken, 1 star ,5 years ago,The best part about the meal was the bottle of sparkling water. Unfortunately it stopped working mid way through the meal. (it works like a spray)
75,Balthazar's Keuken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious meal, with kind and attentive staff. Truly a delightful evening."
