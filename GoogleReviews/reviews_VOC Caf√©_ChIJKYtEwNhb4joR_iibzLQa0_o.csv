2,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The place is a colonial style old building that doesn't look much like other modern cafés. But it serves the most authentic and delicious food and beverages. Their pork dishes are exceptional, and their lamprais is so much better than …"
3,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,High quality shorteats at reasonable prices. Their Sri Lankan and Western breakfast is fabulous!
4,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Realy good place to have a great lunch oe dinner. Pork in this restuarent is awesome. One of a good place to have nice pork meal. If you are a pork fan you should tey this place. They have home made ginger beer. Price also worth for the food.
5,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 months ago,Had the lumprais and a juice. It was awesome.  Very reasonable prices.
6,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place with enough seating area....You can chill at both indoor and outdoor seating upon your choice. …
7,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good Sri Lankan food. The lump rice was nice. The hoppas and string hoppas were great. Service was very good as well. Would recommend this place.
8,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is small,  but sell many different snacks and lamprais. First time for me try lamprais and I love it. Sure I will come back when I visit Sri Lanka again"
9,VOC Caf√©, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food at the VoC Cafe in the Dutch Burger is  without a doubt consistent and of  top quality, however the quality of food was not the cause of sheer disappointment for me, it was their sub-par service which prompted me to write this …"
10,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best authentic lamprais served here. Sells out pretty fast. Frozen lamprais also available. Priced at Rs. 505/- each. homemade ginger beer is recommended. They also serve kottu and hoppers for dinner. Burgers also available. Parking available. Seats about 16 in the AC area. 20- 30 outside.
11,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Ordered a chicken lamprais via their delivery partner appigo, Don't get fooled by the small size of the packet. The rice is tightly packed and enough for a person. The rice has the authentic taste along with the rest of the curries, however missed the egg. Well def order again"
12,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great place to get authentic lamp rice. Friendly staff tasty food. They have great sandwiches and some awesome homemade fesh juicy prices are reasonable and service is quick. Will recommend for anyone who was a quick bit, lunch or dinner. they have great pork sandwiches."
13,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Old workplace. Authentic homemade Lamprais, Homemade ginger beer and iced coffee and the homemade icecreams, Southern Fried Chicken Burger was what I know those days were authentic and recommended. 1 more homemade drink available occasionaly that you gotta check with the cafe."
14,VOC Caf√©, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Some of the items from the menu was not available,  waiting time was way too long for the food to arrive; especially when the order was basic. The waiter gentleman didn't know what is available on that day,  so we placed the order and had to change the items thereafter.."
15,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a bacon and egg pastry which was great. Had a good quantity of bacon and was worth the money. Ordered a 'frozen' strawberry cheesecake ice cream for dessert. This was the worst Rs250 spent! Sickeningly sweet and doused with artificial colouring and flavours, it neither tasted like strawberry or cheesecake!"
16,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The garden area provides the perfect ambience for relaxation while enjoying a cool beer. Great food but the portions could improve in proportion to the cost. Friendly and courteous staff who may find it difficult to cope during during weekends.
17,VOC Caf√©, 1 star ,a year ago,"The lamprais used to be so good but they are now tasteless.  Very disappointed that they have used chickpeas instead of fish in the cutlets, the chicken looks like it has been minced and the prawn blachan is a paste with a sweet taste."
18,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good quick bite joint. Clean and hygiene. Short eats and Egg hoppers are good. String hopper kottu not much tasty though. There are meaty dishes too with yellow rice, lumpraise etc. Service is slow and moody. Parking available."
19,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Clean, Professional, Service. Only gripe they charge service charge and taxes. But they are not merely a short eats type of place. They are a full fledged restaurant offering a wide variety of food. I requested for a fresh orange juice with …"
20,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The 4 stars is only for the food. Very tasty lump rice but to be honest portions are small for the price.
Biggest problem is the service and speed of food. No coordination and very slow. …"
21,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food and great ambience if you sit in the courtyard. Don't miss it if you love hoppers and string hoppers. And their black pork curry is heavenly. Likewise their wattalappam dessert.
22,VOC Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Lots of history to this little gem.  The food was a delight for our first meal in Sri Lanka and the staff are very friendly.  If you’re feeling apprehensive about the strange dish names just ask and you’ll find there is something here for every taste.
23,VOC Caf√©, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Generally they do serve good food and todays experience was horrible cos there was no taste in the Lamprais they are popular for, my order was a take away and The chicken in it was almost going bad,  i live 8 km away if not i would have …"
24,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You either love or hate it, you go there for the traditional Burgher flavored food and snacks. Its the VOC cafe taste you crave and enjoy, and if you have to que or wait a while its all part of the charm, its not McDonald's it's a place to slowdown and enjoy time with the friends you came with."
25,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely experience - lamprais was to die for. Strongly recommend ordering this.

Food took a ages to come out though - even though we had booked food in advance."
26,VOC Caf√©, 1 star ,2 years ago,This place used to be a good place where we enjoyed our weekend out and dinner. Today we went for dinner and ordered what we wanted. After waiting for more than half an hour waiter comes apologizing to tell all the things we ordered had …
27,VOC Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Terrible slow service and wrong order! Asked for (and paid for) bacon and egg pastry but when I got to work and ate, it was seeni sambol. Good but not what I ordered. It also took almost ten minutes at the counter although there was only 1 person in front (also just ordering a few pastries). Service certainly needs attention."
28,VOC Caf√©, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good food, we enjoyed our lamprais, ghee rice and drinks. Our server was very friendly. Outdoor area is nice for a leisurely meal and the entire place has pretty cool old-school colonial vibes."
29,VOC Caf√©, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Foods and beverages are excellent. But they took long time while serving foods and also preparing bills also. Wait there more than 10 minutes to get the bill. Strongly not recommend the service but foods are great.
30,VOC Caf√©, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food and hygiene standards are excellent at the VOC Cafe. However, the staff are forever preoccupied with other things and are sometimes not even paying attention to what you tell them. Service time is extremely slow even though they charge premium prices. Very limited indoor seating available."
31,VOC Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Service could be better but great food. After assuring us that the order was taken, 30 mins later we were asked for our order again, which we got after an additional 20 mins with an apology. So best to get takeaways. If you do want to eat in, try to avoid the peak times, the staff can quickly get overwhelmed."
32,VOC Caf√©, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food here had a good reputation around Colombo. But when I paid a visit, I found it to be underwhelming.
The food was terrible. The service was appalling. And it was way too expensive. …"
33,VOC Caf√©, 1 star ,2 years ago,I was at the DBU today for a family dinner and was very disappointed to find a piece of PLASTIC cling wrap in my beef smore toastie. Is it too much to expect safe and healthy food in this day and age? While the manager offered to replace …
34,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Kotthu, Yellow Rice, String-hopper meals and their love cake. These are to die for, and probably the best place to have such traditional food (except love cake I guess) with a unique and mind-blowing taste!"
35,VOC Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great Sri Lankan food especially the yellow rice. Tasty short eats available as well. Home made ginger beer is pretty good too. Slightly pricey but can't complain.
36,VOC Caf√©, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Most of you might be wondering why the three stars? Well we ordered a kothu and string hopper meal. The string hopper meal was really dry and sticky. For a restaurant that has a limited menu the least we expect is be good at what you serve. …
37,VOC Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are ready to compromise your time, money and the potion size for the taste of the food, this is the right place for you. Very tasty food. But expensive, taking hell of a lot of time to serve. I believe the potion is not enough for boys."

Nice ambiance and nice people."
44,VOC Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty food, should uplift the appearance"
