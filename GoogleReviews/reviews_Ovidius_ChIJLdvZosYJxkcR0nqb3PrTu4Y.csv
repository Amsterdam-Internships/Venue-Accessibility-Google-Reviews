6,Ovidius, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Building is beautiful, but staff is clumsy and food is very bad. Steaks are just cooked in the oven, making them chewy. Besides, meat was very inconsistent. Too well done or barely ""cooked"" at all. Would definitely not recommended."
7,Ovidius, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Paid 4,50 for a chocolate milk, tastes cheap and found out it was powder chocolate with water. 4,50 is understandable in the heart of Amsterdam but for this price I expect quality to go along with it. There are other places that are less expensive and quality richer. Coffee wasn't tasteful either."

17,Ovidius, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The service is very bad, one of the waiter is rude and it seems like the waiters forgot that we were here because we waited 45 minutes to order and we had to call a waiter several times before actually ordering our food. We even saw people that came after us and finish their food before we even ordered"
18,Ovidius, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Terrible service, the gamba's aren't properly cleaned or not cleaned at all. They are way too overcooked that even in most of them there isn't any meat left....it has a bitter taste.... if we get sick... we know how it comes"
