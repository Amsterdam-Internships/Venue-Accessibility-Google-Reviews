0,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place which is always busy with crowd of happy people both inside and outside. Never disappointing selection of natural wines by glass. You can also buy a bottle to go with a discount of 15Eur off the menu price. ‚Ä¶
1,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,A good place to drink some wine and do some people-watching. Service is friendly but you won‚Äôt find many things to eat. I enjoyed the atmosphere.
2,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,8 months ago,It's a very good natural wine bar in Amsterdam. We tried some amazing orange wines. The service was also good. They offered to let us taste some wines on the menu before ordering. A good place to hangout on a nice afternoon.
3,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Small but nice wine list, good snacks, cute space. Staff was a little slow and inattentive, but I'd expect that from most places after being shut and opened repeatedly over two years. Will definitely be back."
4,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A fantastic wine bar with lots of character and a great selection of wine, at very reasonable prices. It's located a little away from the really touristy center of Amsterdam and is better for that. There's a good mix here of locals and ‚Ä¶"

6,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great natural wine bar. We loved it
7,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The place is located in the de pijpe region of Amsterdam which is by far the coolest part of town with great food choices. Another benefit is that it's away from the central area when there is way too much pot smell.  This place is a great ‚Ä¶

Don‚Äòt skip the Bread with olive oil!"

they also do take away wine!"
10,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Natural wines and comfort food. Try their sardines with something bubbly! Cool outdoor seating, interior looks a bit too grunge."

16,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for Wine & Cheese. Staff is fantastic, recommendations on point. The cheese platter and the snails, in particular, were top notch. Wine selection is great, wide variety and excellent pairings, thanks to the aforementioned staff. ‚Ä¶"
17,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice little corner natural wine bar. Staff were friendly, into the wine and actually knowledgable about what they serve. Menu is very pretty large but sadly very European focussed . Would love to see a bit more diversity creep on and a few more ""cloudy"" wines."
18,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Tasty wines and friendly personnel, very popular/crowded, leading to long waiting times. ‚Ä¶"

20,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had such a great night there! We came and the place was full. The owner came straight to us and talked to us. He immediately found us two seats in a shared table with another group. After a few minutes we had a bottle of wine, and our ‚Ä¶"

23,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Hands down best wine bar in de Pijp! Auke is my BFF (I hope)!
24,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Quaint natural wine bar in De Pijp, Amsterdam! Such a vibrant little spot away from the masses."
25,GlouGlou, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Well, ""Charcuterie"" and wine was lovely. The service and the toilet (I hope the kitchen was cleaner than this) really üòï terrible. There is not understanding of customer service, which is very typical in Amsterdam."
26,GlouGlou, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Horrible place. Circus. EXTREMELY inattentive, unprofessional rude and arrogant staff. After waiting around to even get to order we had to wait 30 min to get our glasses poured with wine. I don‚Äôt really see/ understand the difficulty ‚Ä¶"
27,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a wonderful evening here! We had the pleasure of an impromptu mini white wine tasting when we were undecided. Very dedicated, caring, and knowledgeable staff!"
28,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This cosy local shines in summer with helpful service to pick from their wine list - winter is cosy but can be tough to get a spot - the snacks go well with the drinks but don‚Äôt expect a meal
29,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Friendly staff, great atmosphere and really good wines!"
30,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best wine place in Amsterdam. Super nice staff, great environment and above all... great natural wines! A must."
31,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to buy bio and orange wines. It's a wine bar first, and a shop later. They have an awesome selection but don't expect to spend too much time receiving recommendations."
32,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A lovely wine bar in the Pijp. They have a wide selection of natural wines. I am an absolute fan of their orange wine, which you can order by the glass. Their terrace is lovely when it‚Äôs sunny. Inside its more like a ‚Äúbrown bar‚Äù. There are ‚Ä¶"
33,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly and helpful staff and a good selection of natural wines and small dishes. The icing on the cake would have been some orange wine from Georgia ;)
34,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best place to go for  excellent natural wines, relaxed and laid back atmosphere, cozy, outdoor space to enjoy the sunset during summer nights. The manager, Laurent, knows the wine business and is super friendly and takes really good care of ‚Ä¶"
35,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love this wine bar! Extensive natural wine list with knowledgeable staff. I gave them a very vague description of what I wanted and they came back with two excellent options. ‚Ä¶
36,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great wines, good prices, super cozy in any season. Some food that looks good, but I never quite get around to ordering. Tables fill up fast in the evening, but make some new friends and share a bottle and a fantastic night is guaranteed."
37,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good wine, outdoor seating not so great."
38,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place played my favourite song right when I entered, so I instantly liked it. Had a great glass of wine. And there's disco lights in the bathroom üòÑ"

40,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Chilled atmosphere, great wine selection and nibbles. You can also play cards and other games"
41,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A fantastic wine bar with a great selection of wines! We ordered the cheese board and loved the selection as well. It's a small and cosy place, and the service is amazing. We were just 2 of us, and didn't have to wait too long to find a place, but if you're a bigger group, there may be a bit of a wait."
42,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Super friendly staff & awesome selection of very fine and special wines üç∑‚ú® A must-go!
43,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The co-owner is very friendly and happy to share his knowledge, especially if you know nothing about wine yourself. The descriptions of the wines on the menu are fun!"
44,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The cutest little French wine bar that will still any Parisian cravings you might have! A lovely selection of natural wines, and some tasty small bites of food to accompany the liquids. Knowledgeable staff that is more than happy to help you navigating their wine collection. All in all just a place that will make you very very happy!"
45,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful place with some very good wines. Bit expensive, but I guess that's what you're paying for in terms of quality. The water served with the wine is a nice and simple gesture often missed in Amsterdam. Recommendable place if you're in for a good wine (and that's the only thing they serve!)."
46,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favourite spots in Dam, fills up quickly but can lose hours here getting loose on a great selection of natural wine. The staff always provide friendly service and are happy to help with explaining their wines. Really good to have the option to buy bottles cheaper to takeaway too."
47,GlouGlou, 1 star ,a year ago,"The menu was full of stains and the table was sticky. Under this COVID-19 crisis, I believe cleanliness should be a top priority at all locations, especially restaurants and bars. 2 out of 3 staff members were very rude. Perhaps one of them ‚Ä¶"
48,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cute wine bar/wine shop in the Pijp with outdoor seating.
Its small place, so if you want to be seated, make sure you arrive a bit early since they don't accept reservations. ‚Ä¶"
49,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice selection of wines but the shop is really overpriced. You can find the same bottles in the Netherlands for 10/15 euro less. + the guy in the shop didn't have the right knowledge and was not able to present the wines. So it is a nice place if you go there to drink wine at the bar but please avoid the shop.
50,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing place! Went here & it is very cosy. The guy who served us let us try a few wines first before we purchased a whole bottle. (You don‚Äôt have to buy a bottle obviously) & he was very well educated on the different type of wines!
51,GlouGlou, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Nice selection of wines, pricey. Very slow service, didn‚Äôt remember our order, wrong bill and charged the most expensive wines without asking. Rude."
52,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect stop for natural wine lovers. Nice wine selection and great service. Many thanks to wonderful Fleur, she is very helpful, made perfect recommendations for our taste."
53,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to go here for having some small bites and great wine. They let us taste 4 wines, so that we could decide which wine we would like to have with our cheese plate. Really loved that."
54,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute, cozy little wine bar.  It was very crowded when we went, but they were very accommodating and shuffled people around to make room for us (and others) as the space filled up.  Great service, great atmosphere, and great wine :)"
55,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A great wine bar with a perfect atmosphere. Wines are excellently tasty, staff is helping customers out if they need so. I'll regularly go and enjoy there."
56,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little wine bar.  Not a lot of selection, but good wines.  Great cheese plate but could have used some form if blue cheese.  Staff are very attentive."
57,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place for wines and snacks in De Pipje. Relaxed atmosphere in a space with personality, perfect for long conversations with friends or a romantic date. Beautiful wine posters on the walls, friendly staff and cool terrace. ‚Ä¶"
58,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good natural wines !! Always worth a visit when in de pijp
59,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved it, the friendly service, how they bring the bottle to pour the wine into your glass and you can hear the sound it makes; glou glou which is the name of the bar. The sharing tables create a cosy ambience. The logo reminds me of ten ‚Ä¶"
60,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Possibility to drink plenty of different wine outside or inside. People are super nice there and the choice of drinks is really wide. Special mention about the toilets: you will feel like being in a disco club!
61,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great wine bar - wonderful selections of different types of wine. Great service... always tricky trying to find a spot - so get there early!
62,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best wine bars in Amsterdam. No pretense, just great juice. Lots of natural and biodynamic on the list and the staff know their stuff. Food is good, but you're there for the wine."
63,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"When you want unique,  delicious wines, Glou Glou is the place to go. Experiment on your tastebuds with their extensive selection of natural wines. The staff is extremely knowledgeable, and quite excited about the wines they offer. Ask them questions, and they will help set you up with the right wines."
64,GlouGlou, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely service and wine.

Unfortunately my friend as well as myself managed to eat something bad from ‚Ä¶"
65,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Those guys know what's up. probably the best selection of natural wines in Amsterdam. Drink there or take a cheaper bottle home. Food choices are limited and peculiar. Which is a good thing I guess, if you're looking for something a little bit different."
66,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So many wines to choose from that I wasn't sure where to start, but the bar staff were super friendly and let me try a few different ones. Excellent wine bar."
67,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the Glou Glou vibe, especially the service, our bartender Emma really made us feel at home and recommended us wines which we would have never tried before! Thank you Emma, my husband and I will make sure that we visit again next time we are in Amsterdam!"
68,GlouGlou, 1 star ,a year ago,"The website doesn't explain the measures during coronavirus pandemic. They only accept people from the same household to sit together. There is no proposition to offer people from different household to sit at the same table, but keeping the distance. The website could be more informative."

70,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice bar, natural wines, service is ok."

74,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love love this pace! Gets crowded but is still worth it!
75,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A wide range of wine selection. The staffs are really friendly. One of my favourite place in Ams.

77,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Glouglou is a winebar like no other.
Specialized in french natural wine, be prepared to throw your preconceptions about wine out of the window alltogether. No wine tastes alike, and they all taste ‚Ä¶"

80,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Funky looking wine bar. The waiter came with some great recommendations for us. Relatively small place so less suitable for groups.

97,GlouGlou, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Better wine quality than someone would expect in NL for such cozy casual place. Arriving after 7 during weekends will mean the place is crowded.
98,GlouGlou, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute place to drink unfiltered wine! They will discount your bottle if you buy from them!
