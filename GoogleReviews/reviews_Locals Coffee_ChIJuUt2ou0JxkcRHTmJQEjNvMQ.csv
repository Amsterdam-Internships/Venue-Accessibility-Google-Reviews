1,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Cafe with a very good atmosphere, we ate Poached eggs avocado sourdough with avocado mash two poached eggs, and Triple stacked pancakes, stacked pancakes with banana, blueberry and maple syrup the coffee was made just right hot and very tasty, definitely worth a visit"
2,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Chicken sandwich
Poached eggs
Pancakes ‚Ä¶"
3,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Really enjoyable cafe to have brunch outside in a quiet street in a very comfortable atmosphere. We had the egg Benedict that we had asked with some extra truffle oil and the eggs with salmon. All was very tasty. Same for fresh orange juice and green smoothie. There are many brunch places around and this one is worth the visit.
4,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"One of the most underwhelming brunches I've had. The ""sourdough"" bread was just two slices of normal bread that were hardly toasted.
The avocado was spread so thinn on the avocado toast, and the garnish was one ‚Ä¶"
5,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,A nice coffee for having a quick lunch. We waited a bit too much. The food was good and the price normal.
6,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Pleasant coffee shop to get a breakfast by a sunny day.
Friendly staff and nice location.
A√ßai bowl is great ! Not too sweet"
7,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice place. Prices are very high for what you get. It tastes good, but it‚Äôs nothing overwhelming. The waiting time was very long, but staff was very friendly."
8,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Normal for breakfast üç≥
Coffee - 2‚Ç¨, not tasty üòê
Avocado chicken toast spicy and good."
9,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Delicious brunch and coffee. Nice place where to have breakfast or brunch. Very kind staff. Definitely recommend. :)
10,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I‚Äôve found this place by chance. Wandering around to find a breakfast place to ho and it was a nice find. Great coffe and food. I really lined the stack of pancakes with fruits and bacon. On the weekends can be a bit crowded but you can ‚Ä¶
11,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Cozy coffee, located in a nice neighbourhood. Had brunch in one of the tables outside as it was nice weather. The pancakes and matcha latte were good. Friendly staff. Nice place to visit and have a relaxing time."
12,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,4 months ago,having brunch here becomes my regular routine ü•∞ Egg Royale w/ latte is my go to combo ü§§
13,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good variety of options without being overwhelming, which means that each plate is very well done and delicious. The service was exceptional, everyone was very nice. ‚Ä¶"
14,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,a month ago,"They are slow and sometimes forget what you ordered but they are always super nice. The food is good. Having food outside when is cold might not be the best idea, so better wait for a not so bad weather or book inside."
15,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,"""We are closing at 16:00"" is what we will remember from this place. They told us this 3 times within 20 minutes 30 minutes before closing time. We got the message loud and clear. The hot chocolate was hot but didn't taste like chocolate."
16,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,Place and service is nice but food is very disappointing and expensive for what you get. 2 tiny pieces of bacon = 3‚Ç¨. No sauce on the salad. But most plates dont even get salad. It‚Äôs just all a bit stingy on quantity and presentation.
17,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Quite busy and really a bit overrated.
Both eggs royale (make it better myself) and scrambled egg with truffle (bland as hell) were not great‚Ä¶"
18,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Locals coffee makes a really amazing coffee! They sell tasty croissants and pain au chocolat and then have a brunch menu. I was not blown away by the eggs Benny and salmon version (royale) due to them being served on what seemed like bread rolls, but the atmosphere is great and the staff are super friendly."
19,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very cool for brunch, a bit pricey but understandable because the food is cool and the location is great, in the Pijp area."
20,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Tastes great but I'd like to get a slightly bigger bowl for the price.
21,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Excellent location for the breakfast of the day!
The coffee, juices and breakfast are nicely done and prepared."
22,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Very nice place to have a good breakfast. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. Highly recommend !
23,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a month ago,Such a cozy spot with delicious brunch and friendly staff. In love with the vegan pancakes üòä highly recommended!
24,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"I would agree with last review. Very nice food, and coffee. Staff are also welcoming. However, the prices are probably little high. They do the volume so I believe the prices can be revisited."
25,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,a week ago,"The service is very slow - it's difficult to get the waitress/waiter's attention just to get the menu. The tables are very squeezed, so it gets very noisy. Considering the low quality of the service, I really don't recommend"
26,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Really friendly staff - I had a great cappuccino and a pastry. I would note that the wifi didn‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs not a good place to work (the menu says no laptops after 11 am). That being said, highly recommend for a nice breakfast."
27,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Ordered the pancakes using UberEats. They were delivered promptly. Unfortunately the pancakes were terribly undercooked, so maybe they should have taken more time. ‚Ä¶"
28,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Good coffee and good food BUT. Coffee wasn't super warm even when freshly made. Food portions are TINY. I had one piece of bread with avo and chicken for 12.5 euros. I also asked for it to be toasted but it wasn't. So really dissapointed ‚Ä¶
29,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a month ago,Went 2ice. Had nice food. Nice cake. Nice coffee. People were nice too. Really good
30,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This coffee is soooooooo good! Absolutely love their before 9am deal. And the lady in the mornings is incredibly friendly. I am very happy my office moved so close to this nice little cafe! Plenty of seating and welcoming vibe üëåüèº
31,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Visiting from the UK on business and reserved a table at Locals for a breakfast meeting. Great food and service, and a good sociable circular table too"
32,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"One of the best a√ßa√≠ bowls ever had, really recommend."
33,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Really expensive place for what you get. We ordered two Sandwich (a chicken and a veggie one), ‚Ç¨12'5 each. And we got a slice (!!) of bread with the ingredients on it. So a toast... They were nice and tasty but the price is not worth paying them! Stuff was friendly and quite fast."
34,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We stumbled upon this place as we were looking to have a late breakfast/early lunch and we were nicely surprised but what they served. We shared a granola bowl with an amazing a√ßai cream and a salmon and eggs toast. Both were really good. The staff was also very chilled and very nice.
35,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Worst experience ever!
Our orders were taken and we have waited patiently for more than half an hour, we tried to talk to the waiters they ignored us for a while and when finally ‚Ä¶"
36,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Dont understand the hype around this place. We waited over one hour for our food to arrive. That is absolutely unacceptable.
Overpriced on top of that. For that amount of money you can get a breakfast buffet at a 5 star hotel."
37,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice place, friendly staff. The brunch is solid, slightly more expensive than others, from a perspective of price/value ratio."
38,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Good eggs benedict, but it was a little dry. Could have used butter or more sauce on the bread."
39,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The best coffee and brunch in Amsterdam!
40,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Like a lot of other reviewers, we found this place by chance. Walking past it looked so cosy and cool, we had to go in. ‚Ä¶"
41,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Food is not bad, but whole waiting experience doesn‚Äôt worth it. Shortage of staff is very clear, as it‚Äôs very busy, as waiting time to get a seat, make an order, get the correct order - takes ages."
42,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a small cozy place in the middle of a nice Amsterdam neighborhood to enjoy breakfast. The staff is efficient and kind to take to order ad serve. Nothing better to start your day in Amsterdam museum quarter.
43,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Nice and modern design of the interiors. Delicious breakfast options and very friendly staff. Highly recommended!
44,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I guess the locals coffee has a lot of locals, but we found it very comfortable and typical amsterdam. And it was very tasy, wow... liked it so much... you can sit inside or outside... depends on the weather :/"
45,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A good place for breakfest/brunch.
The food was fresh and tasty
And the service was good."
46,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Amazing place and great coffee. Spend a lovely morning here in the sun with a coffee and croissant and would recommend it to anyone who needs a break and a good time. The service was extremely kind and clearly familiar with a lot of the ‚Ä¶
47,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,6 months ago,"I really wanted to like this place, coffee was alright but the food was sadly terrible, overpriced, empty and took almost 45 minutes to get a piece of toast with some avocado on top. My recommendation will be to not come and eat here‚Ä¶ a waste of time and money."
48,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,For me a perfectly located spot in a quite more quite part of amsterdam with very green streets and a nice more calm atmosphere. Great espresso and i also recomend the pastries.
49,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The place has amazing vibes and good nice atmosphere. I tried the berry and mapple serup  pancakes and they tasted fine, although i believe a cream chant√© or double cream would have been an instant upgrade to the dish. I tried also the eggs ‚Ä¶"
50,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Always a friendly face, great coffee and my place to go if I am in De Pijp."
51,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,8 months ago,Worst server I've ever had on vacation. It took 25 minutes for us to get any drinks in front of us. I ordered a smoothie and it sat for 15 minutes before it was delivered. The server didn't check on us at all. He only ever dropped off ‚Ä¶
52,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Cozy place for breakfast/lunch. Interior is also very nice, i kept looking around the whole time. The smoothie bowl was really nice"
53,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice food, employees  and coffee. Only disadvantgage: not family friendly (esp. with small kids: No high chair, no nappy change available)"
54,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, good coffee. Prices for coffees/teas are reasonable but for food you should choose another place. Three stars are for the hygiene... Please use a dishwasher machine......"
55,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice atmosphere and the food was really tasty. Busy at the time so part of our order was delayed. However the staff was nice and it was worth the wait.
56,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"The food isn‚Äôt very special for what you pay, but it‚Äôs okay. Friendly service and nice terrace are definitely a big plus"
57,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Nice food and service, several vegan options, get the pancakes!"
58,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice food, long waiting."
59,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Fantastic service and perfect coffee with decent dining options make for a top notch cafe experience in De Pijp.
60,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,This is absolutely one of my favourite brunch/lunch places in De Pijip. Everything is super delicious but also super friendly & nice  owner and team working.
61,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The staff was attentive and kind. The poached eggs are basically two eggs in a toast with HALF CHERRY!! haha when I read tomatoes I expected soMething else. Something else that I guess they cannot do, I ate in less than half an hour because ‚Ä¶"
62,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really Nice coffe for breakfast.
we firstly plan to go to another coffee nearby, but end up get into here by accident. ‚Ä¶"
63,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,5 months ago,I LOVED the eggs royale. Will definitely be coming back next time I‚Äôm in town.
64,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Stumbled across this place. Best Caesar Salad I‚Äôve ever had. 5 mins walk from the Van Gogh Museum. Lovely place. Lovely people. Total recommended.
65,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Tiny portions, too expensive. Don't even expect to be close to full. There are much better places at this street, this one has been a waste of money.
Also, even if you dare to go, never order their avocado chicken sandwich. It is literally smaller than my hand(which is already quite tiny), but somehow costs a fortune."
66,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,6 months ago,Terrible service. Waited 15 min to get the attention of one of the waiters even if I made a reservation. No apologies. Lots of time waiting before getting the ordered dish.
67,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely corner place. Very friendly and nice services. Good coffee also. Great place to relax for a while. Quite busy and with an international feel to it :)
68,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This is one of my favorite spots in Amsterdam. The coffee is delicious and food is superb. To top it off the staff is very friendly and welcoming.
69,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"healthy yummy local food & drinks, revommended!

FYI photos for A√ßa√≠ bowl & Spicy tuna salad"
70,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely brunch place üëçüèª cool staff and cool clients. The cesear salad is rather specific with rosted chicken and anchoas
71,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,4 months ago,Waited for about an hour and left without eating as the service was horrible and unprofessional. Don‚Äôt recommend this place at all!
72,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, great service and amazing atmosphere. One of my new fav spots."
73,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,5 months ago,So good breakfast! Super delicious! Pancakes and Benedict are must!
74,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Food took a bit longer than desirable but every staff member was really nice. Food was also very good!
75,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Food took over 50 minutes to arrive at our table, which was very frustrating. Especially as the waiter did not check in with us at all post ordering. After arriving the food was quite bland. Disappointed as my expectations were high from reading the reviews."
76,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice easy food, friendly staff, great to sit outside."
77,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This establishment certainly does not have to buy reviews. We travelled all over Europe in May and this was the best lattes we had, bar none! Wife had the Acia bowl and loved it and I had the pancakes which were a little sweet for my liking ‚Ä¶"
78,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The place is well located. But I was not impressed by the poached eggs. Super over cooked.
79,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I've ordered a scrambled egg with coffee. Friendly staff and cozy place. Strongly recommend it.
80,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great coffee and surprisingly delicious food. The employee was really friendly creating a warm environment as soon as you entered the place.   .
81,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and healthy options for breakfast! A little bit of waiting time if you go at a rush time... Otherwise top!
82,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,a year ago,Placed our trust in the wrong guys for a lovely Valentine's Day morning. Their Vday boxes that were promoted sounded so appetising and appealing that we decided to pre-order them the night before for 9.30am on the 14th. The food only ‚Ä¶
83,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quiet place, good food, perfect for a breakfast or a brunch."
84,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great coffee and service. And a pancake!
85,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Our food was mediocre especially given its inflated price tag. The friendly staff and nice setting made up for it slightly, however I would not recommend."
86,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice place with a friendly service, good cappucino and yummy pancakes!"
87,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's not always easy to find a decently-treated and prepared coffee bean in mainland Europe outside Italy but a note on the window of Locals specifying 'baristas wanted' suggested they were serious about coffee, and in the gentrified area ‚Ä¶"
88,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,simple but tastyÔºÅBread is a little overbaked for me but still taste good.
89,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best coffee in town! Nice outside seating and very nice staff! A definite MUST when you visit Amsterdam! Nice variety of food and no problems when you are vegan as well. Love it.
90,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Amazingly bad service, when asked to open the umbrella of the outside tables, we - with a baby - were asked by the waiter to wait and never came back. ‚Ä¶"
91,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very nice place in de pijp. Good location and very nice. They have delicious bagels for brunch! The only thing it was that they forgot two times our drinks.
92,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A beautiful little chic coffee place that serves delicious food and coffee. We drank capuccinos and flat whites while we ordered the pumpkin soup, the Caesar salad, fresh croissants and poached egg avocado sandwich. We were attended to by ‚Ä¶"

Took a little while to get food, but was a busy and rainy day and were full. Would definitely go here again!"
94,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Shockingly this was the worst brunch experience in Amsterdam. The eggs on avokado bread were nothing special, the pancakes were dry, chewy and thin. The service was rude, unfriendly and none welcoming. There are so many other better places."
95,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Excellent coffee, good atmosphere, great neighborhood. And very friendly service. Had a great time."
96,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Did they buy all these positive reviews?

I ordered a glass of wine. The glass came with all kinds of dirt sticked on it. ‚Ä¶"

Excellent food & coffee as well as kind & professional staff! The atmosphere is layed back and relaxing.
Definately reccommend!"
99,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very poor Service. Have asked for a bread for my meal, but it came 15 min later when the food was could. No exuces or so. Waitress offered free Drink and even havent brought it. Any request caused a reaction of dissatisfaction...Food is also very specific: Anchovy and over salted honey chicken in Ceasars Salad.."
100,Locals Coffee, 1 star ,a year ago,"I made an order for breakfast at 7.30 am with expected delivery at 9.15 am. Food arrived at 11.15 am. I could not cancel the order because it was already ready, so no refund was available. Of course the breakfast at 11.15 was not needed ‚Ä¶"
101,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good spot for coffee and lunch. Was a bit busy but the staff was super friendly and found us a table. Food came in fast and was delicious. Small menu but can do the brunch and snack purposes. Free open WiFi

Everything good."
103,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Veggie sandwich. Just perfect. Coffee too
104,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A great little caf√© on a corner in Pijp. Doesn‚Äôt have a lot of atmosphere, and isn‚Äôt the most quiet place you can go to for breakfast, but they do you have indoor and outdoor seating when it‚Äôs warm, and you can get great coffee and my ‚Ä¶"
105,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent service and delicious food! I tried the ""Burrata"" and my girlfriend the ""Poached Egg Avocado"". We got our order on time and the visit was all worth it. If your nearby de Pijp then Locals Coffee is definitely a place you need to visit."
106,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,11 months ago,The coffee was terrible! Has nothing to do with quality or taste... And the prices are definitely at the higher end. A second star comes for the interior
107,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Brilliant coffee and a lovely cinnamon croissant, however - wish they did a wider selection of food here. Mainly just pastries and yoghurts. A very local place and not too sure tourists were overly welcomed!"

112,Locals Coffee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good option for breakfast. Clean and quick service.
113,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,One of the best ice lattes in Amsterdam and the brunch and service was great!
114,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The Drink was too sweet, Nata was a size of a nail for 1.5e. Its ok to be 3 euro for 2 natas but does it had to be that tiny..? Just hard to get it cause egg price stays the same even though its pricy neighborhood. ‚Ä¶"
115,Locals Coffee, 2 stars ,8 months ago,Edit: In 6 months the price of the burger has increased multiple times. From 9.50 EUR to 15.
116,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Love this! So cozy, great food!"
117,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,a week ago,Friendly atmosphere and nice food
118,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If one wishes to feel the city of Amsterdam and Dr Pijp as one of those neighborhood not to be omitted, come to this beautiful Cafe on Saturday morning and enjoy the best coffee with Banana homemade cake, with the beautifully smiling face of any of the girls serving. Great place to feel like home!"

126,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great, friendly service."
127,Locals Coffee, 3 stars ,a year ago,"All in all a good experience; nice place, friendly staff. But for ‚Ç¨17 you'd expect a bit more than a small piece of bread; sandwich wasn't sufficient as lunch."

129,Locals Coffee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is my favourite lunch spot in Amsterdam! The coffee is the best iv ever tasted, and the interior is beautiful. Would recommend this place to everyone."
