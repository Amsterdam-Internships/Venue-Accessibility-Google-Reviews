0,Levant, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"A Turkish Restaurant in the canal side with a seasoned chef organizing mezes, starters and main courses in a good fashion. Nothing like a kebab or doner place. It's much more cosy and upper in terms of taste and service quality. Definitely a go again place."
1,Levant, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"See the picture.
Delicious Turkish food and breathtaking view, as well as friendly service!"
2,Levant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was craving Turkish food and made reservations here. There is a terrace on the canal, but due to the weather we sat inside. Very pretty place.
They bring by a tray with vegetable and seafood mezzes. We selected three, all ‚Ä¶"
3,Levant, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"A fantastic Turkish experience with excellent tapas, wine, and food. Highly recommend it to anyone craving a Turkish restaurant that comes in at a reasonable price for what you get, which is a lot."

7,Levant, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great restaurant, the owner allowed us to sit in after kitchen closed. Food was delicious."
8,Levant, 5 stars ,9 months ago,For me the best Turkish restaurant in Amsterdam with a very nice combination of menu with both fish & meat and starters. We have been there several times so far and never disappointed! Both inside and terrace are perfect depending on the weather. Definitely suggest Ali Nazik with beef and ciger as a hot starter.

16,Levant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great meal. Fine choice of mezze, literally, they are brought for you to choose from. We enjoyed both the lamb shoulder and duck breast with fruit as mains. Generous portions but just squeezed a dessert in. Service with a smile! Turkish Rose (dry) wasn't bad either. Wines may be a bit above average in price though."

19,Levant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Levant Reastaurant in Amsterdam might be the best place for excellent taste of the Turkish cuisine even compared with many 5* restaurants in Turkey!
You don't have to believe me: just go there on an evening and be yourself the judge of your own taste!"
20,Levant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good-hearted people: I forgot my apple airpods pro, and after 1 hour realised it. They had kept them aside for me- really honest staff, genuinely kind! I had a few starters and the lamb main course- excellent food on top of a great service! Will be back and very thankful!"
21,Levant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Everything so fresh and delicious service is also so nice staff so friendly also owner always there it‚Äôs a big difference makes ...
22,Levant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"What can I say, high-class Turkish cuisine, at an affordable price. However, perhaps a better explanation of meze appetizer prices would be needed. For the rest, the undisputed quality of the food, especially the fish, in a very particular location for a gallant dinner, a stone's throw from the Museumplein."
23,Levant, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Stopped here for a beer, great service"
24,Levant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We went there on a Saturday night back in March. Food was amazing it was so good especially the starters I recommend the feast so you taste everything. I would suggest you go on an empty stomach tho ;) they will feed you well!! Service was great and the atmosphere so enjoyable! Recommended best Lebanese I ever had hand down üôè
25,Levant, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice place with caring staff. The second time I went here they even remembered my diet!
26,Levant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent service with an authentic food to match. The owner is very welcoming and caring for his patrons, rest of the staff is pleasant as well. The atmosphere is very relaxed, in the summer the terrace facing the canal is the place to sit, and in the winter it is warm and cozy inside."
27,Levant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, great service, great food! We had the lamb, beef tenderloin, and lamb steak. For an appetizer we had tuna, hummus, and tzatziki. Everything was excellent! My 20 month old son had a meltdown and the staff couldn't have been more understanding or accomodating. Highly recommend!"
28,Levant, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Good restaurant with kind people. The starters (mezze) were delicious, very good Tzatziki and fresh baguette. The main course was very nice. The meat was cooked perfectly and in combination with the pesto did it taste very good. ‚Ä¶"

31,Levant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice, cozy restaurant. Good selections of Turkish raki. Decent turkish meze and good value/price. However don't expect too many options that u normally can find in Turkey. Very friendly staff. I recommend here, especially if u have guests."
32,Levant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent place for a fine Turkish meal in Amsterdam! Extensive choices of mezze made fresh everyday. Good wine list. Main courses were awesome as well. Highly recommended!
33,Levant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent service, great variety, comfortable setting.  Lots of choices in this area, but this stood out for us.  Try the local plate for an appetizer.  Excellent blonde beer on tap."
34,Levant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Better than the ones in Turkey. Amazing canal view with very calm atmosphere. Great food and great Turkish hospitality of the staff make you feel more than happy. :)
35,Levant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We tried this latest addition to the Flat White empire and really enjoyed it. Snuggled between two other eateries on lovely old Saddler Street this is a cool place for a light lunch or just a quick snack and a hot beverage. The stripped back decor is in keeping with the Flat White oeuvre yet the place is warm and cosy.
36,Levant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is delicious here. If you are visiting the restaurant in a warm day, you will love the backyard which is in front of the canal. Staff is a bit rude I can say. If the place is a bit crowded they have problem of stress management."
37,Levant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really friendly, waiter was super accommodating and helpful, lovely food, and a fantastic terrace hidden away out back overlooking a canal. Had a great birthday evening with grandparents and kids."
38,Levant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful terrace right on the canal. We enjoyed our dinner here. Recommend getting a few different mezze plates - portions are on the smaller side
39,Levant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Altijd goed eten! A most amazing restaurant.  For years we have eaten here. Food always excellent,  service, and atmosphere is great."
40,Levant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Expensive for what it is and the waiter is very pushy to sell more which is not great seeing the price of the dishes already quite high.
A good example of the poor quality are the toilets which are very dirty and half broken. Not worth the price"
