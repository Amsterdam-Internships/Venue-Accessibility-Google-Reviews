5,Mama Dough, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good pizza of a satisfying size for a slightly high price. Drinks are really good, including beer and lemonades. Staff was friendly. Recommended"
6,Mama Dough, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Fabulous, well-chosen, selection of pizza toppings. I‚Äôd give 5 stars except that the pizza dough is really salty, so there‚Äôs little contrast between the base and the toppings, which given the excellent quality of the ingredients, is a disappointment. However, if you enjoy salty food, you won‚Äôt mind at all."
7,Mama Dough, 1 star ,a year ago,"We're not happy at all  !!!!!!!

I believe 1 star is way too much for what we received. One SAD LOOKING Tuna ‚Ä¶"
8,Mama Dough, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Very nice food especially the vegan pizzas are worth their price.

12,Mama Dough, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great pizza. A bit pricy but that‚Äôs Amsterdam prices.
13,Mama Dough, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was really excellent, nice atmosphere, friendly local authentic place.
Pizza is fresh and tasty. Prices are inconsistent with desserts costing nearly as much as mains! The owner and his staff do a great job."
14,Mama Dough, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty pizzas. I go there often.
If you‚Äôre are looking for a typical Italian pizza recipes it might not be the right place. I would say the pizzas are more a revisited version of classics. ‚Ä¶"
15,Mama Dough, 1 star ,a year ago,I believe 1 star is way too much for what we received. One SAD LOOKING Tuna pizza for ‚Ç¨12.95..... if anyone dares to call that a tuna pizza. You can actually count how many canned tuna flakes are present on top. Used to be a nice food.... someone is degrading this place. Good luck with it.
16,Mama Dough, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"After ordering Mama Dough home delivered several times, we decided to go into the restaurant to try the full experience.

20,Mama Dough, 1 star ,a year ago,This place used to make excellent pizzas...but of late...my gosh.. the ingredients are not fresh or tasty...neither are the topping adequate..Really confused as to what changes or went wrong.
21,Mama Dough, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice pizzas for a good price. Great summer time outside pizza place.
22,Mama Dough, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty italian-style pizza! I enjoyed the salsiccia & friarielli taste, but I'm pretty sure the other ones were also quite good. But the plus of this place is the interior, extremely nice and cozy. Also the location is quite nice, very close ‚Ä¶"
23,Mama Dough, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Favourite pizza place in my neighbourhood. Delicious pizzas. You can simply walk in to their take-away, the order will be done really fast, and you can observe the guys crank out the pizzas."
24,Mama Dough, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"do not understand the excellent ratings, maybe the chef had an off-day? tuna pizza was too moist, cannelloni had too much cheese etcetc. the tiramisu was good though!"
25,Mama Dough, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good pizza. They have many specific Italian ingredients that you don't find in a regular pizzeria. Nice ambience and solid wine. Pizzas could be a bit larger though.
26,Mama Dough, 2 stars ,3 years ago,My partner had had a great pizza from this place so I was curious to also try it. We ordered the Fico and the Diavola and were both a bit disappointed. The Diavola only had salami on one quarter of the pizza and only two small pieces. There ‚Ä¶
27,Mama Dough, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pizzas are big which is nice because you get your money's worth of deliciousness. Pizza crust is great, tartufo pizza recommended. Sgroppino is the best I ever had, and the staff is nice. A little bit quiet on a Tuesday perhaps.."

43,Mama Dough, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So glad we stumbled across this little place. The food was so yummy and the staff were the nicest we'd met on our whole trip. I highly recommend Mama Dough.
44,Mama Dough, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is good, but service slow and not very professional. Some dishes come from a shared kitchen, like the tiramisu; it‚Äôd be logical that prices would be a bit more competitive, but they aren‚Äôt."

53,Mama Dough, 5 stars ,10 months ago,If you are looking for authentic Italian pizza taste than Mama Dough is
54,Mama Dough, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Worst pizza base I've had in years. If I'd wanted bread I would gone to a bakery. 6euro for kids pizza... Same would have cost 2euro at a turkish shop.
55,Mama Dough, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great and quick service for Amsterdam, Margarita was solid, but the salami on my diavola was not tasty at all"
