5,Biladi, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Really tasty authentic Morroccan food. Their lentil soup and raisin couscous are to die for!

8,Biladi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice, small, Moroccan restaurant in non-assuming sphere. The food was great and portions more than reasonable.

I would have liked them with a little more ""bang"", but I was the only one who felt that way."
9,Biladi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A true gem in the middle of Amsterdam West. It is very hard to find in this city an inexpensive restaurant that offers great food , and this is without a doubt one of them. The food is marvellous (meat, fish, salads, anything!) and the …"
10,Biladi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I walked 2.6 miles (little less than 5k) for this restraunt because it was the closest place selling coucous; it was completely worth the hour long walk. This is by far the best meal I've had in Europe and the service is good. My …
11,Biladi, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Indeed, too bland. Quite not authentic. I ordered 2 chicken tajines. The chicken was kind of added later so no flavor in it, only boiled. The potatoes were not inside the tajine, but they were fried (!!!) and aside the dish (Dutch way?). …"
