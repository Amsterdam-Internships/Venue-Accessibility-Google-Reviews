0,BoerGeert, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Great sandwiches and freshly made!
Lots of ingredients to choose from, and the price (around 5 euro each) is ok. My only advise would be to use a bigger piece of bread instead of the bit small baguette,s... you can then raise the price to 6 euro easy. Overall worth a visit."
1,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Absolutely amazing (if you are not afraid of cheese/greasy sandwiches). I love the Mexican sodas, and the personal is very efficient and super attentive! I could eat there every day !"
2,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Been here couple of times and every time had a different sandwich. All of them are equally lekker . Service is fast and food is delicious. Highly recommended as best sandwich place. Will always come here if nearby.
3,BoerGeert, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit pricey, but very good sandwiches. I think the warm sandwiches are the best, make sure to take the steak teriyaki with wasabi mayonaise. The pastrami sandwich is also recommended"
4,BoerGeert, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Arrived well  before closing but staff were already cleaning. All the tables were in a corner and the smell of the cleaning products didn't do anything for the ambience. Sandwich was tasty but I think quite expensive for what you get.
5,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Must try if you like good sandwiches! Haven't try it all yet! They're not cheap but so satisfying!!!
6,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Very good! Make it fresh and hot.

11,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Such a friendly place! I came in 5 seconds before closing time, no problem whatsoever. I had two freshly made sandwiches and I could take a seat without having to hurry. Perfect sandwiches already for years and years at decent prices. Service with a sincere smile!"
12,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is really fresh, selection is quite good and service is very fast.
It can get crowded quite quick during lunch hours but the fast service means you will not wait too long before receiving the food. Though if you plan to sit while eating, one might have trouble finding a table."
13,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow their sandwiches. It's a busy spot, but the staff works quick and with a smile! At an unlikely spot along a ginormous car crossing, these little fatty yummy sandwiches will bring you joy."

15,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Good options, good service, good portion, friendly staff. The Teriyaki sandwich with wasabi mayo is great."
16,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As a non Dutch national, this kind of food was new to me. Staff was friendly, English speaking, and helpful in recommending items to eat. Food tasted great, reasonable pricing and I will definitely revisit. Only downside is it was kind of tricky to find, as it is located in a (kind of) industrial area. Loved it!"
17,BoerGeert, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I loved it... super friendly service and really tasty sandwiches
18,BoerGeert, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best sandwiches, the are so many favourites, I can't even start. Just make sure you try the Beef Teriyaki with grill sauce, the pastrami sandwich and the classic Beenham with mustard sauce. It's located on a busy junction, so don't expect a farmlike view (like the name suggests). But do give this place a visit"
