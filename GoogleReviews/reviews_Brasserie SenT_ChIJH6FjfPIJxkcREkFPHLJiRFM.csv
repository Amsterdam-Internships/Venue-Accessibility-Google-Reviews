0,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Small quiet location away from busier restaurant areas might make you think that this is an average place, but the food was exceptional and the staff were all incredibly friendly. Highly recommend the chateaubriand and sea bass, and the octopus and salmon starters were also excellent. For vegetarians, the ravioli was also very good."
1,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Wow, what a fantastic restaurant. Intimate with a real local and warm feel. The food was incredible (order the lamb if it's still on the menu) and we could not believe how hard the lovely owners were working."
2,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Simply amazing.
On the photo: Valens rib roast and Chateaubriand
The photo contains a less than the real portion. It was hard to resist. …"
3,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great food!!! I don’t usually eat meat but their chateaubriand is amazing. Service was okay.
4,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I love how quite hidden SenT is in De Pijp!
The food is well-served and tasteful. Their Crème Brûlée is the best!
Please go find this little gem, you won’t regret!"
5,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Cute place run by a husband and wife. Food was delicious. And although this is a steak place, I was blown away by the deserts. Order two if you have the room in your stomach!"
6,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Although as a French guy, i was impressed not to have bread (maybe baguette) to dip in the very tasteful gravy, this restaurant is purely amazing. I would recommend a million times!"
7,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We've had a few meals here on separate trips to Amsterdam.

It's tucked away a little outside of the main centre but still really easy to …"

9,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was excellent value with great customer service and amazing tasting dishes. Their meats are excellently cooked, their chips are one of the best I've ever had and I'm from the UK. Really good affordable wines and lush deserts. I …"
10,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great selection of wine that matches their selection of delicious meat. Starters were all great, loved the teriyaki tataki the most. The meat was superb along with fries and fresh salad. We weren’t able to finish the meat but wanted to try their desert which was fab! An overall great restaurant with friendly service."

14,Brasserie SenT, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"The staff is amazing, always smiling and helpful, even when they are terribly busy. But lack of staffing made us wait around 1 hour 15 minutes until we receive our food, which is not really ideal. Chateaubriand was ‘allright’, however the …"

17,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Walked in. Short menu. Turned out that we loved whatever we ordered. Very delicate but unpretended with full of pleasant surprise. The food comforted us after travelling among cities.
18,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food and wine here are amazing!  There is a resident cat, that in my opinion, is just a perfect addition to this place.  Roasted duck, steamed bun with pork.  Save room for dessert, because I didn't!"
19,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really like the restaurant, best steak!! Good location in depijp, good service. Definitely will go again."
20,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"On a quiet street, signage not clear.

22,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"we had a pretty good dinner, although the meat was not amazing, I was a bit surprised they did not even ask how I wanted mine (medium, rare etc). All in all nice atmosphere and service. Reservation needed"
23,Brasserie SenT, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The ribeye is overcooked and the waitress didn’t ask me how should the steak be cooked(rare, medium rare, etc.). The coffee is okay, the wine recommendation is great, and the service is attentive. Considering its high price I believe 3 star is reasonable."

25,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Food was good, but the glass of wine has to be served at the table and not coming directly the kitchen."

30,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,a month ago,Good atmosphere and the meat was quite good.
31,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Chateau Briand done perfectly every time in the Green egg - if only it was BYO wine so I could bring a big Aussie red to go with it

40,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice little restaurant in a quiet street in De Pijp (great location), and if you enjoy meat, most of them are cooked in The 'egg' (barbecue), and taste delicious. I also tried the octopus as a starter... Yum! …"
41,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Its a decent restaurant with a high class meat experience. Chateaubriand is their speciality and it’s very good. You get what you pay for. Big and tasty salad, nice fries coming along with meat is delicious.
I go here few times in a year to enjoy good/fast service and meat."
42,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,a year ago,The octopus is phenomenal. The meat as well although unfortunately we ordered it medium rare and got well done and a bit dry. Count on about 50 euros per person.
43,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service, price, food in a cozy atmosphere. The beef is amazingly good."
44,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,a month ago,Best porc ever. And there is a cat.
45,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I feel like this is a bit of a hidden gem. Beef and pork cooked to perfection on a ""green egg"".  Perfect fries. Great wine pairing.  The relaxed atmosphere belies a great fine dining experience that was frankly unexpected.  Personally.. I'd …"
46,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best steak that I have tasted.
47,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was excellent and they had very reasonable prices. They don't have many options, but everything we had was perfect. The leg of lamb was to die for, as well as the veal. Highly recommend this place, we were able to get a reservation on a Friday night but the place was pretty busy. Service was great as well!"
48,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best chateaubriand steak you can find in Amsterdam. And I do not exaggerate! Being a foodie and big fan of exclusive food experiences I am forever addicted to this place. No Michelin star level prices in there, but their meat does deserve a star!"
49,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I happened to walk past this place on a busy Saturday evening. It looked cosy and lively so we decided to have dinner there. The staff were really friendly and attentive, giving nice drink and food suggestions. Nice place for a date or …"
50,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fresh ingredients used, generous portions, well cooked. Nothing too fancy, just well prepared and very good service. Price is fair compared to similar brasseries who clearly overprice their meat dish. Let s face it, a cote de boeuf or a rib eye is easy to cook and doesn t require to be a stared cook..."
51,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Oh wow!!! Amsterdam was never a good place for food. But it's changing and this is one of the best French restaurants I've ever visited. Not too much fuss, great atmosphere, great service (also not common for the Netherlands) and the most important, perfectly made food. Not cheap but definitely worth it. I'd love to come again. Thanks."
52,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good meat, perfect wood smoke but not over powering, bearnaise also well balanced, fries also deserve a praise. Plus good quality/price ratio, it has been many times and never disapointed !"

54,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The chateaubriand at Sent is consistently excellent. Haven't found a more delicious steak in Amsterdam. Sauces and fries also great and the service always very friendly.
55,Brasserie SenT, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The octopus entree and lamb main were great. Capable kitchen crew that knew to adapt for gluten allergy. They usually have GF fries/chips but put breadcrumbed deep fried stuff in the day before we came... no chips for us but, I'm glad they knew to not serve them."
56,Brasserie SenT, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, ambiance and experience!"
57,Brasserie SenT, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good, but the service was abhorrent. They forgot our starters, salads and tried to serve me Coke, when I specifically asked for Zero or Light. Clearly not enough staff and the waiter we had wasn’t quite up to her job, as she didn’t …"
