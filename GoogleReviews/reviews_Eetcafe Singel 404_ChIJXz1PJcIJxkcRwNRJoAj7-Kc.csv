0,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,a month ago,Nice spot for high quality food & drink at the right price. Seems to us like a good reliable kind of place.  Recommended! üëçüèª
1,Eetcafe Singel 404, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Location is great, but food is average. I do not recommend the burgers. The meat tastes weird, and it has American cheese on it. When you order a burger you expect to look it like a burger, but for 13e you get something oddly shaped. Eye and taste buds were left unsatisfied."
2,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This is our food recommendation for the area! We had a great sandwich, panini and fries for a reasonable (if not low) price. The atmosphere was very welcoming and relaxed and we had a great time here!"
3,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great location, great service, very tasty food.. perfect for a quick bite by the canal.

12,Eetcafe Singel 404, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A great, casual place for a bite to eat. Their ""sandwiches"" are topped with ingredients to the full, making sure you get your money's worth! Makes me wish all sandwiches were like this."

16,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Just fantastic. Great food and very good vegetarian options. We went in for sandwiches and what we got was just incredible. I loved the brown bread with vegetables and red pepper hummous. Must try the homemade lemonade with mint and orange too!
17,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great and simple food : soup, sandwichs, pies...tasty, fresh, big portions and not that expensive.

31,Eetcafe Singel 404, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cheap and tasty food! The soup was delicious! My personal low point was that they almost only had breadies.. but they were delicious anyways! üòäüëçüèº
32,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food, friendly staff. What else could you ask for? Great little find! Fresh ginger tea too."
33,Eetcafe Singel 404, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A cosy place with a wide choice of food. A bit pricy and can be busy in peak times.

42,Eetcafe Singel 404, 1 star ,2 years ago,We have been coming here for years. We loved the place. This time everything was just so average. I got the oven melted goat cheese sandwich with brown bread. The taste was just not delicious. It used to be sooo good. Bread was not crispy ‚Ä¶
43,Eetcafe Singel 404, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Fancy food. It was not possible to get regular bread and eggs. I had a tuna melt and that tastes good.

45,Eetcafe Singel 404, 1 star ,2 years ago,"About a year ago, this used to be a reliable place to have a tasty sandwich made with fresh ingredients. But something has changed. Our food was truly regrettable: my smoked salmon sandwich was smaller than advertised (one slice, not two), ‚Ä¶"
46,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is an absolutely fantastic lunch spot. I had the goat cheese and grilled pumpkin sandwich.

48,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I was recommended by another tourist I'd met in another city who called them the ""best sandwiches EVER.""

49,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food here was amazing, the best lunch in Amsterdam. The staff were very friendly and made room for us even though it was busy. The prices are fantastic for what you get, go for the oven melts and the homemade lemonade is perfect!"
50,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Singel 404 is one of our favourite places to have lunch during the weekends. The price/quality ratio is great and the staff is very friendly. We normally order a sandwich together with some soup. This is great and very tasty. It can ‚Ä¶
51,Eetcafe Singel 404, 2 stars ,a year ago,I used to visit this place a lot. Now days quality food ( broodjes) and also the service is really poor. I think they have changed owners. It‚Äôs is sad because the food here used to be really really good. I always ordered the warm broodje 33.
52,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A small cafe with great selection of sandwiches. Friendly and attentive service. I had the goats cheese & pesto with veggies on corn bread. It was delicious! The portion was very generous!

54,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this place, always visit when I'm in Amsterdam. Chicken and bacon on farmers cornbread was delicious and their take on nachos was amazing!! If they added coriander to the nachos too, it would have been perfect. Thanks!"

56,Eetcafe Singel 404, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very warm and cosy place to relax and have a good coffee, brunch or lunch. The staff is very nice, the food is good and rather healthy without being excessively expensive. Maybe the only small downside is the quantity. ‚Ä¶"
57,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Altijd gezellig! Great lunch options (salads, soups, excellent sandwiches) and indulgent desserts, cozy atmosphere, friendly staff. The place is very small, so expect some waiting time over lunch and in the weekends. The wait is totally worth it. During summer, you can enjoy your meal or drink looking at the Singel canal. Zo leuk! üòÑ"

59,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Not a place to miss! Our favorite spot for lunch in Amsterdam. Amazing soups, huge sandwiches and awesome desserts! on a side note - service tends to be a little on the slow side, so don't go there if you are starving - plan ahead!"
60,Eetcafe Singel 404, 1 star ,2 years ago,SHOCKING. Food took over 1.5 hours to come and was badly burnt. We were about to walk out and they insisted we sit. Coffees came cold to both my table and our friends - they cannot make proper coffee. They also burnt their bacon and told ‚Ä¶
61,Eetcafe Singel 404, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I've been a client of Singel 404 since 2016. The place has recently changed management and everything dropped in quality. Coffee is watery, breakfast is of poorer quality. It turned into an average touristic place."

63,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Lunch time. People are full inside. Service is good and fast. I always chose the food named with the shop brand. So the ""singleclub"" sandwich didn't disappointed me. The taste is very abundant."
64,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I found this place in 1999 when on holiday from the US, and I visit every time I'm in Amsterdam. I may have flown over from London for a day trip to see a museum and get a BLT sandwich here. The BLT is amazeballs. üòÅ"
65,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cozy place, mostly sandwiches on menu, but they are huge and really tasty ones. Look for daily proposals on whiteboards. Big variety of drinks"

69,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Not as cheap as it used to be. But portions are just huge. Has been serving top sandwiches for years now. Though I do miss their Sandwich of the Week. Let's hope it'll make a comeback in the future!

75,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The staff was really nice and a table outside of this cafe under sun was just a treat. We ordered fried eggs with beef on toasts and a fresh croissanr both of which were divine

85,Eetcafe Singel 404, 1 star ,5 years ago,1 star because it smelled really bad inside. They need to do something about that. It is unhygienic. Sandwiches are great but not if you smell sewage while having lunch.
86,Eetcafe Singel 404, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Have tried to eat here around 5 times, different times of the year. Not once, I got to meet a waiter sitting at the tables, so ended up standing up and walking away after 15-20 minutes."

91,Eetcafe Singel 404, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Brie, smoked chicken, quacamole, sun-dried tomato panini is a show-stopper. Large portions and great prices."
92,Eetcafe Singel 404, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service not attentive at all, and the ""sandwich"" we got was nowhere near the value for money we expected. Much better alternatives in the neighborhood."
