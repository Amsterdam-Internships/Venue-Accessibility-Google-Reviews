13,Pancake House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I heard a lot about the Pancakes from Netherlands offering many many toppings. As we entered the place, you can feel the ambience, it's small but vc well kept. ‚Ä¶"

15,Pancake House, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The food was simply amazing and the service was fantastic. I was elated with the service and how nice they were.  The only reason I didn't rate it higher was the price. A bit too expensive.

17,Pancake House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,This place was expensive for a simple breakfast. Really nothing special. Personally i could do better at home. With a little looking there are better places. ‚Ä¶

24,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious comfort food in a comfortable setting.   Jasmine took very good care of us on each of several visits.  Clean surroundings including kitchen. Prices seemed reasonable to me.  Recommended if in this wonderful neighborhood.
25,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,These Grand Marnier ( liquor)  pancakes were amazing!!
26,Pancake House, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very cute place covered in Dutch Delft tile-style decor. Good menu of sweet and savory Dutch pancakes but pretty pricey for what it is. Decent espresso drinks. Quick service and could pay by card.
27,Pancake House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It took 20 minutes to be attended after being seated. After waiting for 45 minutes, we told the server we were in a hurry and needed to go within 10 minutes, we were told that we were the next to be served a few minutes later we got the ‚Ä¶"

29,Pancake House, 1 star ,3 years ago,This place was terrible. The food actually was decent (coffee not so much) however the woman server was absolutely horrific. She was so extremely rude to me and my friends. She makes you feel incredibly uncomfortable and will freak out if ‚Ä¶
30,Pancake House, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"nice food, prices okay for amsterdam, nice people"
31,Pancake House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible food and service. Pancake undercooked massively, English breakfast incredibly poor (undercooked mushrooms, rock solid bread) Blonde waitress rude along with manager, and not one waiter came over to check on us.
There‚Äôs hundreds of other places miles better to visit in Amsterdam."
32,Pancake House, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Rather pricey for 1 pancake but it did taste yummy with alcohol on the pancake,"
33,Pancake House, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Our hotel in Amsterdam suggested us to go and try this place. We went there hoping to eat the best pancake in the town. However, we ended up being in a horrible place. I could say that the expensive pancakes were kind of acceptable. The ‚Ä¶"
34,Pancake House, 5 stars ,a year ago,Mimmo was super friendly and invited us to eat at the pancake house! The pancake was super tasty! Location very central and a perfect snack after a long day in the city.
35,Pancake House, 1 star ,2 years ago,Worst customer service in Amsterdam. Very loud lady with slow assistance. Disappointing food. Food looks like cooked from home. Actually home food is better. I regretted eating here. ‚Ä¶
36,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We thought we made a wrong choice because it was virtually empty - which is never a good sign in the middle of the afternoon - and we were too tired to make a decision. Turns out, the pancake was gorgeous! The dough had the right ‚Ä¶"
37,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super good pancake with ham and cheese, with the fluffy, soft dough. I didn't see when I finished it! Staff was friendly and whole place has its own unique atmosphere I'm going to come back and try other ones. Definitely worth to visit!"

39,Pancake House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited at a quiet time in the evening: service was attentive and friendly, and the pancakes were delicious. A little pricy perhaps, but in keeping with the area, and I didn't feel like I was getting a rough deal. Lovely fresh mint tea too!"
40,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Incredible food, great atmosphere and very reasonable prices! Jasmine was the friendliest most energetic and fun charming waitress in all of Amsterdam! Recommend visiting this restaurant, Jasmine will brighten your day and make you feel welcome!"
41,Pancake House, 1 star ,3 years ago,The Spanish lady who served us was extremely angry and rude. An extremely bad attitude. She threw down the the plates in front us and walked away. The lattes we ordered were 90% froth so she clearly needs some barista training. Throughout ‚Ä¶
42,Pancake House, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"No service... Walked in asked the person behind the counter if we could sit anywhere, they said yes. There were 2 other tables occupied, one with food and one without. The person behind the counter continue d to make the food for the table ‚Ä¶"
43,Pancake House, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The food is alright. I had dinner with a friend and We ordered a Hungarian pancake, a Dutch sweet pancake and Dutch pea soup. Not the best pancakes in town but it's satisfactory. ‚Ä¶"
44,Pancake House, 1 star ,6 years ago,The food is really good. Can't say otherwise. But the service from our waitress was disappointingly uncourteous. We were left unattended for quite a while waiting for the rest of our order; 20 minutes after finishing our meal and no ice ‚Ä¶
45,Pancake House, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Not the best pancake place in town, but serviceable if you know what to order. Make sure they don't put frozen fruit on your pancake, as that won't be anything special. ‚Ä¶"
46,Pancake House, 1 star ,4 years ago,Wish there was an option for zero stars. It took a half hour to get two pancakes (there were only two other parties in the whole restaurant) and when they arrived the dough was raw. We didn‚Äôt eat them since we didn‚Äôt want to be I‚Äôll but ‚Ä¶
47,Pancake House, 1 star ,5 years ago,My mouth actually fell open when they put my waffle down in front of me!! It was served on a dessert-size plate and measured about 4x5 inches. This for almost 8 euros. It would have been another thing if it had been mouth-watering. It was ‚Ä¶
48,Pancake House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is great. The issue is the very slow service. The Mgt should know.1server only and full pack will not work. It's a tourist spot,there should have more staff.tourists are on tight schedules.  It took waitress 15minutes to come to ‚Ä¶"
49,Pancake House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We came in around 9:30 am on a Saturday, and there were plenty of seats.
The staff is very friendly amd helpful.
I had the bacon and cheese omelette and a nutella banana pancake, and everything ‚Ä¶"
50,Pancake House, 1 star ,2 years ago,My partner and I can't write an honest review about the food as we didn't even choose our opportunity to order any food once the very rude waitress attended our table this morning. We walked in to enjoy a cold drink and a light snack and ‚Ä¶
51,Pancake House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We walked by this place and were drawn in by its beauty and our desire to try a pancake. The server was extremely friendly, and the service was quick! Our food was delicious and the ambience was perfect. Highly recommend!"

53,Pancake House, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Stopped in for a mid-afternoon snack while touring around. It was in a nice building, and looked quite inviting inside. After sitting down and looked at the menu, the prices were pretty crazy (13 euros for their sweet pancakes, 3 euros for ‚Ä¶"

56,Pancake House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Waitress not very professional. She was talking and laughing with the cook while taking our order so she wasn't listening. The pancakes were not so tasty, and the American breakfast was tasteless. Very expensive for tasteless food. Don't recommend it."
57,Pancake House, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I wish I had skipped it all together. These people don't serve regular tap water and in a place like Amsterdam, ironic. The waitress had an attitude because I did not order a water bottle. The food was random, a tourist trap big time. To the point that the cheese they use is Kraft singles processed cheese for a over 10 euros plate."
58,Pancake House, 1 star ,3 years ago,Shockingly poor food. The pictures and the menu lie to you about the content of the food. English breakfast sausages were simply tinned frankfurters. Utter rip off and waste of money. The photos showed beautiful sausages. The food quality was dreadful; this place should be embarrassed.
59,Pancake House, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Being in Amsterdam was great and having a local delicacy was a must. The restaurant offered us some great pancakes and it was good sizeable ones. It was filling and delicious. It is a busy little place and staff were very attentive to our ‚Ä¶
60,Pancake House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Cheapest ingredients they could source, ordered full English breakfast and it came with hot dogs rather than actual Sausages, unhygienic, saw the chef using the toilet then not wash his hands coming straight out. Paid ‚Ç¨3.50 for a latte and ‚Ä¶"
61,Pancake House, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Avoid at all costs, I wish we had.
We went here as we were looking for a place to try traditional Dutch pancakes and also to get out of the rain! If we hadn't been in such a rush to get out of ‚Ä¶"
62,Pancake House, 1 star ,5 years ago,Everything negative they say about this place is more or less true. We ended up here because our English visitors wanted to have pancakes and they had walked enough in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶
63,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The pancakes here are amazing (especially the mini ones)
Our server was super nice and sweet! Visited a few times during our stay. It‚Äôs a small clean place too."
64,Pancake House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Had omelette, salad and a tostie, it was really awful and terribly overpriced. Overcooked omlette, cheap bread canned mushrooms, cheese and ham slices for bread in a salads. It's like they took what was supposed to be toppings for an awful ‚Ä¶"
65,Pancake House, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Bad, very very bad. 16‚Ç¨ for a pancake without taste, the worst cappuccino ever. And most of all, absolutely not kind, we waited 20 minutes for a bottle of water, than we stand up and get out. Never again."
66,Pancake House, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The pancakes taste delicious, but the prices are excessive. In addition, the restaurant doesn't provide tap water, EVEN to patrons who order a beverage and would like tap water to accompany the meal. The service is very rude."
67,Pancake House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty, although can be a bit pricey. I had the pancake with Nutella, ice cream and whipped cream for 12 euros. My wife had Poffertjes (little muffins) with sugar and lemon for 6 euros."
68,Pancake House, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Not even real pancakes, more crepes"
69,Pancake House, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"We came here because it was recommended by one of the hotels in the area. The single-thin-layer-pancakes were tasty, but almost ridiculously thin, for a big price. Moreover, the workers were not very friendly, and unwilling to attend us, and even lazy at the time of charging us the bill... I will not come back."
70,Pancake House, 1 star ,5 years ago,"There wasn't an option for zero stars. I wish there were because this place is beyond acceptable. They charged my card twice, wouldn't refund me, wouldn't serve tap water and the food was terrible. They were unapologetic until I told them I ‚Ä¶"
71,Pancake House, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Local pancake shop with varied kinds of pancake.
72,Pancake House, 1 star ,6 years ago,Terrible. Ridiculously expensive for a pancake (‚Ç¨10 -13). A small glass of flat lemonade (not from a can or an individual bottle) ‚Ç¨2.75. I was overcharged by ‚Ç¨3 for my tuna salad and when I pointed it out the woman making the pancakes ‚Ä¶
73,Pancake House, 1 star ,7 years ago,As a local citizen I would not recommend this place. I went here because my daughter wanted to eat pancakes for her birthday and we couldn't find anything else still open and close by. ‚Ä¶
74,Pancake House, 1 star ,6 years ago,"The abhorrent service completely ruined our time at this cafe. The two girls waiting were unapproachable and rude. Our meal took far too long to arrive and it was delivered with an air of ""I can't be bothered"". Both girls were clearly ‚Ä¶"
75,Pancake House, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We were greeted with great warmth by the lovely ladies and they helped us wade through the extensive menu to our choices. The food qas amazing and they could not have been anymore helpful even planning our outings for the next day. We even got to meet Sara and ahe gave us gifts that we will treasure
76,Pancake House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The crepes are delicious with options being well thought out.  It is a bit of a tourist trap, though.  Lunch for two was over $50US, but we had a great experience."
77,Pancake House, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The pancake house is in a great location and the food is decent. If you've never had dutch pancae or crepe, make the trip, if you have, then keep walking. ‚Ä¶"
78,Pancake House, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Stopped in for a quick breakfast. Eggs were gorgeous!  Pancakes were crepe-like. Jasmine was fun and entertaining!
79,Pancake House, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice pancakes . Overpriced though. Probably due to touristy location.
80,Pancake House, 1 star ,9 years ago,We waited for at least 40 minutes for our food. Don't try the Mexican style. It's totally overspiced and not tasty at all. The coffee is ok. The orange juice is from concentrated!!! It's totally shitty. You come to a breakfast place and expected to have fresh squeezed juice!! Totally not recommend it!
81,Pancake House, 1 star ,6 years ago,I visited Sarah's pancakes 2 days ago as we really wanted to eat pancakes in Amsterdam... we were served by a lady who was indifferent and rude throughout. My 5 yr old was playing with a fork and she yelled at him from the counter. We ‚Ä¶
82,Pancake House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The scrambled eggs and pancakes were pre- made, yesterday.  The eggs were crusted over and room temperature.  The pancakes were rubbery.  The crispy bacon was clear white and flubbery.  I didnt eat it and still had to pay for it.  I was disappointed and hungry when i left."
83,Pancake House, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Took about 45 minutes to take out order. Sodas arrived flat which we sent back, glass was just topped off and given back. For the price per dish, food leaves you wanting more. We asked for a glass of water (legal requirement in the Netherlands) and were denied. It's just a seriously understaffed tourist spot."
84,Pancake House, 1 star ,3 years ago,Waitress rude food ordinary but very very pricey would not recommend this place music loud and distasteful as if they knew it would not appeal to an older clientele and was put on after we had ordered.  Need to learn some customer service
85,Pancake House, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My favourite place to visit in Amsterdam! Fantastic, friendly staff serving lovely food and drinks. A huge selection of pancakes, both sweet and savoury, along with other foods such as waffles."
86,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Massive selection of sweet and savory pancakes. Lovely people, good coffee and big gorgeous pancakes. Did not skimp on the Nutella"
87,Pancake House, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Food was just OKish, but still it was incredibly pricey. They also didn't allowed the group to split the bill and charged extra for paying with card.
Definitely not place I would recommend and surely you can find better alternatives nearby."
88,Pancake House, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great food and cheap price. Tourist friendly!
89,Pancake House, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Servers seemed annoyed by customers for no reason. Restaurant door had to be hand closed and if a new customer didn't realize this, the server would either yell at them or stomp over to shut. Drinks took forever to come, same with food. I wouldn't return. I'd try somewhere else."
90,Pancake House, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A great place for pancakes. Had one , which was very filing, could not taste the sweet pancake.
Very good service."
91,Pancake House, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We wanted to try another pancake restaurant in Amsterdam but were really disappointed. The pancake was dry and instead of strawberries we got a jam. We got better pancakes in Pancakes Amsterdam restaurant
92,Pancake House, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food is nice but extremely over priced. Waitress extremely rude and wouldn‚Äôt even look at us. Did everything with her back turned. Shockin. Spend your money elsewhere.
93,Pancake House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food large variety of both sweet and savoury pancakes, great hot coffee, reasonable price. Good service from friendly staff"
94,Pancake House, 4 stars ,5 years ago,We had one breakfast there and it was very good. The portions are descent. The seating out side has about three small 2 person tables.
95,Pancake House, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good service, reasonable prizes. The pancake it isn't something that you gonna remember the rest of your life, but it's ok."
96,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best pancakes I‚Äôve ever had!!!
97,Pancake House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Large pancakes with lots of options for toppings. Good value for the money. Fast and friendly service. Indoor and outdoor seating available.
98,Pancake House, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Not worth the price you will be paying for a modest pancake. Amsterdam have a many better alternatives if you want to have a good tasting pancake. Beware of this tourist trap!
99,Pancake House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff, but overpriced pancakes with very low quality ingredients. Wouldn't recommend it."
100,Pancake House, 1 star ,6 years ago,"worst servicve ever. Our friend from NY wanted to eat here. We hadnt seen them in 7 years but were not allowed to sit together. No solution we offered (putting tafels together etc) was accepted, we could only sit at aonther table (with our backs to our friends)"
101,Pancake House, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Service was great,  food was tasty.  They have some interesting toppings,  I had the bacon, cheese and banana pancake.
Maybe a little expensive."
102,Pancake House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Useless, waited 40 minutes for food that never came despite being right beside the kitchen, they assured us that we were next and then went on to serve a handful of other people, didn‚Äôt even notice that 4 of us got up and left, just to ‚Ä¶"
103,Pancake House, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"‚Ç¨1 to use card. ‚Ç¨25 euro for 2 people but food is actually really good. 2 pancakes with bacon, really tasty but a little expensive."
104,Pancake House, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The taste is just soso but you have to wait for a very long time. Overpriced. The waitress is not friendly.
105,Pancake House, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It did not feel that clean and someone from the staff was smoking so the smoke came into the restaurant. Food and service was bland. Has potential for sure but I won't be coming back.
106,Pancake House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The service was good, but unfortunately so of our food came out of a microwave. The food was still not bad regardless"
107,Pancake House, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"A little bit overpriced for the quantity of food... (2 eggs, 1 coffe and 2 packakes for 15‚Ç¨)
Service was fast but the waitress was not necessarily pleasant"
108,Pancake House, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was good, but the service wasnt good. We had to wait a lot to pick up our food and more time for the bill.. They weren't polite, so i dont have the best experience there"
109,Pancake House, 3 stars ,10 years ago,"It's been 4 years, but the wife and I liked this place.  Yes, the service was pretty bad and it was over priced. But the pancakes were good. That was the important thing for us when we were there."
110,Pancake House, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Horrible service, they got my order wrong 7 times, and didn't even serve my friend's order at all. We waited for 2 hours. And it wasn't even busy inside. Don't go. Save yourselves"
111,Pancake House, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is nice, but pricey. A simple waffle ran for more than ‚Ç¨ 6,50. The staff are enthusiastic, though."
112,Pancake House, 1 star ,6 years ago,"10‚Ç¨ for one pancake on a cold plate, 9‚Ç¨ for lousy Waffles with a really bad chocolate sauce. Cannot recommend it at all!"
113,Pancake House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worst service, and the most impolite waitress (manager?) I‚Äôve ever seen...definietly not recommend to anyone."
114,Pancake House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,You can get much nicer dutch pancakes for the same price elsewhere. Not amazing
115,Pancake House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Wow... If you want expensive and very simple pancakes, there you go... not a great time."
116,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Jasmine was the best waitress. Gave us the best food suggestions. Great service.
117,Pancake House, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Decent but nothing fantastic. Pancakes are slightly thicker in the middle and a bit flour-y after a while.
118,Pancake House, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Service is a bit slow, but it has a nice, local feel and there is a large selection of pancakes!"
119,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved it! Wish I knew how to get back there because their food was delicious. A taste of Amsterdam

138,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely  food. Normal price.and friendly. I will be back.

140,Pancake House, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Definitely worth a trip here. Loads of choice. Fantastic food, great service."
141,Pancake House, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Parts of the menu have limited availability during the day.  Otherwise a good breakfast place.
142,Pancake House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious pancakes üòç
143,Pancake House, 1 star ,5 years ago,Angry staff that yelled to each other in front of the guests. Unwilling to change the menu (take egg instead of beacon at the breakfast).
