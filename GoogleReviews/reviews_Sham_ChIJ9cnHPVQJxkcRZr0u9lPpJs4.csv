21,Sham, 4 stars ,a year ago,We truly enjoyed the place. Very good ambience and the meals are delicious 👌 If you're lucky you can enjoy your falafels while watching the view of the canal.

36,Sham, 1 star ,2 years ago,The food could be cooked better. The portion is so small comparable with the very high price. But the problem was the long waiting time for anything we order. In addition to the waitress whom we had to remind three time of our drink. It is …
