37,Toscanini, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Been here not even once, but twice, and must say i am really not impressed with the food, especially fromthe price/performance point of view.
They have a wide nice wine collection though, but for good Italian food, there are other places in Amsterdam."

40,Toscanini, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not impressed with the food. Also not sure if there was one single Italian cook or server in the restaurant. Not a good sign. The dishes reminded me of a middle of the road bistro, there was no soul to the cooking. It just lacked in ‚Ä¶"

44,Toscanini, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The only thing this restaurant has going for it is a good wine list. My mother and I both had a pasta dish and an entr√©e. The noodles were overcooked. The dishes were all flavorless. As a fan of Italian cooking and someone who has traveled ‚Ä¶
45,Toscanini, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"You don't have to drive for days or fly for hours to have a good Italian dining experience.

60,Toscanini, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I really dont understand how this place has good ratings. The staff was incredibly rude, my wife and I were reading our menus and he walked up and just cleared his throat instead of a simple ""hello"", a disgusting phlemy sound was used. ‚Ä¶"

68,Toscanini, 4 stars ,10 years ago,"A real italian restaurant located in the Jordaan. Wonderful food and wine, to be enjoyed while sitting at a round table. I like this Italian because it is very much focused on quality rather than quantity, but do not be afraid to go home ‚Ä¶"
69,Toscanini, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A French guy having one of the best Italian meal he has ever had... in Amsterdam....there is something illogical. The food is great and the people very nice.
