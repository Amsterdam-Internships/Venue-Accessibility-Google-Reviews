0,De Maria, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Service was good but a bit slow. The staff were very friendly.  Only problem was that the menu stated the fajitas came with cheese but it didn't arrive with it.  When we asked the waitress she seemed confused.  The ribs were nice but would have liked more sauce.
1,De Maria, 1 star ,6 months ago,The meat is good. That is all it has. Meat was a bit overcooked on half of the tiny t-bone (yes only half of it was overcoocked) they took waaaay too long to bring the food and forgot our drinks and rice. The coca cola had no bubble and the rice only came after we finish the steak. For the price I cannot recomend this place.
2,De Maria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Pleasant and cozy atmosphere.  Steady customers but service kept moving. Drinks came fast with appetizer shortly after.   Food was good. If you want a beef based meal with some chicken and seafood options it a good spot.
3,De Maria, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I reserved a table via The Fork app in the afternoon, but when I arrived the restaurant was closed. Please keep your opening hours up to date for your Fork schedule and Google Maps opening hours. This is basic information."
4,De Maria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A cozy argentina steak house!

5,De Maria, 1 star ,9 months ago,"The food is at least acceptable. The service is really bad. The waiter forgot the order, bringer something alse and at the end he put everything on the check. Avoid the place."
6,De Maria, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The fillet steak was impeccably cooked. Sensational just isn't enough to express how wonderful the steak and sides were.
My wife had the chicken that she said was "" bloody delicious"". …"
7,De Maria, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The steak was delicious! I found the vegetable sides to be fresh and well prepared. Their Argentinian wine goes very well with their menu, the service was upstanding and the atmosphere was fun and intimate at the same time. While a little pricey my husband and I found it to be a great steak dinner for date night."
8,De Maria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"about the food was good, to me who wrote he got excited.  the food was quite average.  micro steak and so-so.  Salad found with difficulty on the plate.  money as in a decent steak house is yes!  in general, this place should be avoided like many other Amsterdam eateries where food for tourists ""will come down like that."""
9,De Maria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was good. I ordered the steak medium and it came out medium which is great. The waitress was nice also. Over all the experience was pleasurable
10,De Maria, 5 stars ,5 years ago,great stake (the ossenhaas just melts in your mouth) and a very cozy setting with ranch-like decor and south american music. Prices are also affordable and the staff is very friendly and relaxed. I ate here a few times and I always felt like it was a great choice! P.S. give the baked potato a try
11,De Maria, 1 star ,4 years ago,"WORST. They charge way to much for very cheap, obviously frozen food. Saying this, the meat OK- on its own! however the starter was bland with plastic cheese and the main everything that wasn't small bits of meat was mushy and bland. Too top it of the staff were rude and intimidating!"
12,De Maria, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Knowing the argentinian meat as I know, I expected to eat the original size, cut and taste of Argentina's meat. The ""ancho""  beef was not so ""ancho"" as expected but taste well. The waitres don't speak spanish, isn't a obligation but would …"
13,De Maria, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Pass. The chicken was cooked well but there was nothing Argentinian about the food. If you are looking for a unique experience this is not it. The prices are high and the food is very generic. I could get the same food at any restaurant anywhere in the world.
14,De Maria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great discovery. Food is very good, the meat is done as requested. Friendly relaxed service, good wine list."
15,De Maria, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food. Slow service. At the time of the visit their credit card machine was broken without telling me upfront, basically sending me off to an ATM after the meal. That was horrible."
