1,The Coffee Company, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious coffee with good atmosphere, and enjoyable music. Can get crowded at times."
2,The Coffee Company, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"It‚Äôs located in a very cool area but I don‚Äôt know if I just had a bad day with the staff here, they were kind or rude. Not very nice and she had a very bad mood to my eyes. I guess everyone can have bad days but I didn‚Äôt get a good vibe ‚Ä¶"
3,The Coffee Company, 4 stars ,6 months ago,People are nice. I'm a huge fan of the chai masala latte. Not a huge fan of most of other things on the menu. I go there for a place to sit and be left alone as you tend to want in a coffee shop. The staff are polite and nice.
4,The Coffee Company, 1 star ,a week ago,I saw someone screw up multiple toasti‚Äôs I hope the CEO toastie will see this and remove his product from this store. An abberation to all toastie lovers. GANGGANG
5,The Coffee Company, 3 stars ,4 years ago,This is a nice and hip coffee shop to hang out at. The music is good and not too loud. A good place to come work out. The staff is helpful and the ambiance is nice. I had ordered the hot chocolonely and it wasn't the best hot chocolate i ‚Ä¶
6,The Coffee Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place to have a coffee and plenty of space for work or study. Nice view on the upper floor.

7,The Coffee Company, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Nice sandwich with great coffee
8,The Coffee Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Expensive, but good tasting coffee, at a location where the lower level of the store and outside seem to be more utilized for coffee drinking and socializing, while the upper level is under a heavy laptop influence (for all you freelancers)"

13,The Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love this place! Good service and good coffee.
14,The Coffee Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good tea selection, and they give you the bag separate from the water by default. Staff are friendly. Excellent WiFi and great working space upstairs (as long as you don't need an outlet; those are sparse). Clean bathroom. My only complaint is the music, but I suspect it's not a problem for most, as others seemed to be enjoying it."
15,The Coffee Company, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A friend of mine recommended this cafe
I came with high expectations and tried out the Matcha Almond Latte with vanilla but could hardly get the vanilla flavour. Nothing great or extraordinary in my opinion."
16,The Coffee Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly. Only coffee open after 6pm on Saturday! Great and easily accessible
17,The Coffee Company, 3 stars ,a year ago,The place is Gentle. But the coffee stains on the table caught my attention that means it hasn't been cleaned. This means it has not been sterilized
18,The Coffee Company, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst service, they could not take/make our order right. It took them 4 times. On the other hand they didnt stop us when we brought coffees from the starbucks across the street (there was no place sit down in starbucks). Perfect example of how not to run business and how ignore guests and have a chat with work buddies."
19,The Coffee Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, very nice coffee for reasonable pricing. Upstairs seating area where people love to study or work. In my own experience, calm enough to study, but the ambience is still cozy"
20,The Coffee Company, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I take when you go upstairs you have to be so quiet like a library, as we all got looks as we spoke, I will be back in the near future and hope to see this on my next visit as coffee was lovely, and staff ,it was the amount studying on ‚Ä¶"

The off is very good and they have sandwiches and cakes.
This is a perfect place for meetings or just to sip a coffee."
23,The Coffee Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good coffee for standard high range coffee house prices. A normal coffee for under 4‚Ç¨ is not really possible, but the quality is very good."

28,The Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good coffee and also fair pricing considering the size of the cups. Freshly brewed espresso and americano are a good choice.

30,The Coffee Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good coffee and a laid back environment where you can chill and get stuff done. Think of this place as the local version of Starbucks only much much better.

32,The Coffee Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Coffee Company, known as CC De Bol Amsterdam for this location, is a Dutch coffee chain, that was founded in 1996 in Amsterdam.

41,The Coffee Company, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Extremely slow service. We waited more than 10 minutes although this is a self service place where you need to order and pick up yourself. There are better places in the neighbourhood, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going there."
42,The Coffee Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Everything was nice except one thing. The 3 ladies in the counter kept talking too loud... I was wearing an earphone and listening music to work, but their voice distracted me quite much."
