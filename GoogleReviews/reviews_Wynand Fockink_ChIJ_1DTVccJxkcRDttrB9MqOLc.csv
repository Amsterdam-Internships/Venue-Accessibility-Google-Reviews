1,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Absolutely brilliant!! .. I can't believe I missed this place in my earlier visits.

2,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"An extraordinary and authentic place to drink the genever liquor. They have flavours for everyone, from the most sweet to bitter ones. The atmosphere was very good! We went for just one drink and stayed a few hours in great company!"
3,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing place!! greats gins from different fruit flavors, from soft to strongs! We tried the fresh ones and were really good."
4,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"One of our favorite experiences of our visit to Europe! It's a bit difficult to find, but when you get there you feel like an insider discovering something historic and wonderful. The drinks themselves were delicious and the bartender was ‚Ä¶"
5,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The most authentic place to have the Dutch national drink Genever. Small bar with the most friendly and helpful bartender. Try it and you will be hooked. It is a Dutch thing. ‚Ä¶

7,Wynand Fockink, 1 star ,4 months ago,"The barmen were rude, they insulted my girlfriend when she ordered a combination of flavors  that they didn't approve of. They said ""if we don't think it will taste good, then we won't make it"". They also threatened to kick me out for ‚Ä¶"
8,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cool liqueur bar just off of Dam square but a world away from the tourists and cyclists swarming the it. The drinks and filled to the top so sipping from direct from the bar is part of the tradition. The staff are welcoming, friendly ‚Ä¶"

10,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasting room is fun, but do the tour and you won't regret it. So many different types of jenever and liqueurs to try. Some are amazing, some are not so great, but it's a lot of fun to taste. Staff is fun and friendly. Highly recommend a visit to any visitor to Amsterdam."
11,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place came highly recommended and it lived up to all its expectations. Don't miss this place if you are in Amsterdam. A very small bar with only standing place but the different varieties of Ginever will keep you coming back for more.
12,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went here after seeing it on Travel Man. Was very welcoming and Hans was very chatty talking to us about the history of the drinks as well as the history of the building and Amsterdam as a whole. ‚Ä¶
13,Wynand Fockink, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I LOVE this hidden gem! A local friend took me here. I tried at least a half-dozen different flavors. I love that they're hand made, and that you can sit outside in the alley sipping from your cordial cup. Such a fun experience. If there ‚Ä¶"

18,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A must see place in Amsterdam. Place is super old (centuries) staff is ver friendly. They will explain you the drinks, serve you very nicely. It gets very crowded in the afternoon and with only 2 bartenders serving,  you better go early. You will find genever, all kinds of liquors and beer."

22,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is awesome! One of the more authentic places we went to in Amsterdam. They only sell bottles there so be sure to leave room in your suitcase to bring some home if you're traveling to Amsterdam.  The people working here were very down to earth & happy to share knowledge about the products. The ginger bitters was our favorite!
23,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing experience to have a drink here. They sell their own liquor. There is also a little shop. If you are in Amsterdam around november, december make sure you get their   ""Christmas borrel"" its a limited edition Christmas liquor which is different every year."
24,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Recently visited here due to seeing it featured on Travel Man on Channel 4. The staff were outstanding, they were friendly and engaging, they explained everything about the liqueurs and the history of the place. If you go to Amsterdam I'd highly recommended a visit here A+"
25,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,a month ago,Amazu! Try the Mikonos!
26,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you like spirits at all, this is the place to visit. Tiny little distillery, founded in 1679. Owned by Bols, but still run as an independent - they make genever. Hundreds of different kinds. In the bar you can try any of them, or any ‚Ä¶"

30,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very old liquor brewery with many tasty drinks. Nice and knowledgeable staff. Only downside was the slow tourists.  Fortunately big groups are not allowed in.

40,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really friendly staff. A massive library of flavored liqueurs. Overall a good experience.
41,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Trust the barman with your most secret desires and he will create the perfect mix for you. This little gem is a must-do when visiting Amsterdam!!
42,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Discover some great genevers, lushious liquors and herbaceous bitters. The very bitter 'burger is Prinsenburger and has a heady concoction in it which includes the mysterious grains of paradise in it. Don't forget to bow for your first sip!"
43,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had such a great experience tasting the vairety of flavours available. The wonderfully flamboyant gentleman who served us brought so much life to the place and showed much excitement when explaining their story.

53,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome variety of liquors and environment. The range is wide enough to offer creamy and sweet (butter cookie is really good), to fruity (passion fruit is also worth a try) and more intense flavours with more than 40% alcohol. Each drink (slightly bigger than a shot) is around 3.50. Can get crowded."
54,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,a year ago,This is by far one of my favorites bars in the world. The staff is amazing and the drinks are delicious! Such a unique place that you HAVE to visit when in Amsterdam!

58,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is an institution all on its own, but what makes it more special is how it has an authentic storied atmosphere that draws in locals and isn't at all warped by the steady stream of tourists in the area.  As a craft, the jenever here is ‚Ä¶"

61,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The ""barmen"" make this place much, much more fun to go to. I'm still not sure what I drank there but it was tangy and spicy and sweet and I thing you should go and try it for yourself. Also have a beer with it, you'll thank me later."
62,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love taking friends and family here because I know that the staff will take their time to give a great experience, a little history lesson, and, of course, a chance to taste a few of the delicious liquors and jenever.

67,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome bar. Potent genevers & entertaining bar staff.
68,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Tiny. Crowded. Dark. Atmospheric. 17th century. Drinks you have never heard of, let alone had in your life. Take the first sip *before* lifting the glass, or be laughed out of the building. An experience."
69,Wynand Fockink, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place is great fun.  The tasting was an amazing experience.   All different types of  genever to try.  They put yourxselection in a glass on the counter and you have to drink it without touching the glass.  Took me a few tries to get ‚Ä¶

71,Wynand Fockink, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome flavored genever liqueur. Staff is happy to make you taste different flavors before you take your pick. Downside is, super long waiting time. And, after you wait for 30mn, you only are allowed to get one glass per person! Waitress ‚Ä¶"
72,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely amazing spirits shop and distillery. They will take you through 300+ years of spirits making and have more than 80 different small batches available for purchase. We aren't even big drinkers and bought 3 bottles for gifts and our own stock. Highly recommend the ginger bitter!
73,Wynand Fockink, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I'm a regular traveler and generally feel I'm forgiving and generous to hard working staff. But I came away from nearly 2hrs at Wynand Fockink unimpressed. They clearly have a good product and story, but the heavy weight of tourism has ‚Ä¶"

75,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice quaint little place, looking rustic and traditional Dutch, giving it the special warmth you need in the cold winter (that + the liquor). The location itself is cool. Inside it is very tiny but they let you try a bit of different ‚Ä¶"
76,Wynand Fockink, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great little bar to visit, the spirits are superb quality and the beers very strong and tasty. The bar is small and busy and it takes a while to get served. The bartender very informative and complimentary about the Scottish. Would love to have bought some gin to take home but could not due to handluggage restrictions."
77,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a must-do on any visit to 'Dam. They have a wall full of fascinating spirits, liqueurs, vodkas and ginevras (a type of gin). Tell them what you want - like sharp and dry, fruity or sweet - and they'll pick out the perfect tipple, or ‚Ä¶"
78,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a really special little Jenever bar. It has been here for centuries and for good reason.

Keep calm and bend for a first zip. ‚Ä¶"
80,Wynand Fockink, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Super nice place with traditional Jenever and other drinks they brew themselves. The people working there (for a very long time) are very friendly and happy to help you. A lot of free try outs before they serve you the perfect drink.
The drinks are not very cheap, it's all about quality not quantity."
81,Wynand Fockink, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I really wanted to like this place. It was highly recommended before our trip to Amsterdam, and my girlfriend and I were very excited to stop by on a Wednesday evening (today). We came in a bit after 8pm and there was a small group of Dutch ‚Ä¶"

83,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place, my partner and I went every night we were in Amsterdam. Great staff and great tasting of different Jenever (a better gin, to us brit's) I recommend coming here as its apart of this country's culture and its alcohol."

88,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent spot for Liqueur tasting and drinking. The gentleman who served us was not only veeeeeeeery friendly but also veeeeeeeery knowledgeable and helpful. We went during the day so not too many people, so more time to choose. I've heard in the evening it's packed, so get there early."
89,Wynand Fockink, 1 star ,3 years ago,I give one cause there is nothing less than this. Don‚Äôt go! Staff is extremely rude and arrogant and drinks are nothing special considering the service. Horrible experience! We were in a group (just ladies) and they were saying they didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶
90,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best place to drink in Amsterdam. Amazing brandywine and very friendly and extremely helpful staff. We probably drank more tasters than actual drinks because they wanted to make sure we had the right thing!
91,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is really cool. It is in an odd area of town. You can get small samples of everything in their little bar. There is also a gift shop where you can get bottles to go. I recommend taking the tour and really learning about the company. We enjoyed it as part of our trip to the city.
92,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This was such a great find. Cool spot tucked away in an alley. The bartenders custom design drinks for you made from dozens of various liqueurs and of course they offer their main product Jenever served in the traditional manner off an old ‚Ä¶
93,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Terrific little bar right by Dam Square. The age of the building is evident in the bowed shelves and really lends to the character. The selection of liquors is second to none with highly knowledgeable bartenders that can whip up a cocktail ‚Ä¶
94,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favorite places to bring my friends and visitors. The staff is super helpful, friendly and thier service is perfect. This place is always full and still, they take time for each and every customer. Oh and the drinks are just amazing. They have so many different flavours and combinations."
95,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My wife and I visited with our extended Dutch family. The staff was super helpful explaining the different types of Jenever. The slurping of the spirits (with hands behind your back!) by seven of us at once was an experience we will never forget.
96,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the plenty hidden gems in Amsterdam. On one hand i dont want to leave a review and make this place more popular and crowded than it is. On the other hand - this place is great and everyone should try it. Its one of the few ‚Ä¶
97,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a cosy little pub, with a million flavours of Dutch gin, great service and happy people. The place to take any foreigner visiting Amsterdam or just enjoy with friends. No fuss, just chill."
98,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wow, what a nice experience! Totally touristy place, but you'll get a truly authentic experience and the booze meister (""bartender"" freely translated into Dutch) is very friendly and will give you the full story of every possible drink available."
99,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Such a wonderful place! So cloae to the awful and touristy Dam Square, and cannot be further from it. A true hallmark of Amsterdam. The drinks are delicious and the tour itself is a must. The best place in Amsterdam to bring overseas guests, a unique experience. Would give six stars if that was possible"
100,Wynand Fockink, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very funny and capable barman. Caters mainly for tourists. Although the genever they serve is good, it is not the best available, since the drink has enjoyed a sharp rise in popularity in recent years and many new and good brands have entered the market. Not many chairs to sit on."
101,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to try some authentic Jenever and sip out of a tulip glass. It can get a pretty busy in the small space with usually only two bartenders so going earlier in the day if recommended.
102,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The tasting is a very cool experience, super cool staff, very friendly as they explain the history of the place and also the many different flavours and nice mixes they offer. Dont miss it!! Totally recommend the place! They also have a store and nice bottles airplane approved :)"
103,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely ladies at the bar, great liquor and cute drinking tradition.  There's also a shop where you can buy bottles to take with you. Beware,  only open till 9 PM"
104,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is very difficult to find, hidden in a small by Street near Dam square. Also difficult to get inside the place and get a drink. However once you get that drink, you realize that it was all worth it. ‚Ä¶"
105,Wynand Fockink, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great distillery in the heart of Amsterdam, a place to visit if you are in love with the Genever. It has a small shop with all kind of traditional liquors and a bar where you can try some nice cocktails. I would avoid weekend nights since it is too packed and it is impossible to enter."
106,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A must do for anyone crossing the Dam monument! This beautiful authentic piece of history is soooooo tasty. Come and taste Dutch brewing culture of brandy and Jenever. Just tell the waiter what you mood of taste is and have him or her make you a suggestion. Enjoy the beautiful scenery.
107,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Followed a recommendation in a mini Lonely Planet guide to Amsterdam to visit here. Serves a handful of beers and a HUGE range of genever and fruit liqueurs. Staff are more than willing to let you try a couple of different flavours (rather ‚Ä¶

110,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you're touristing in Amsterdam, do not miss the jenever tasting experience here, it's a lovely little experience and you get to imbibe a good deal of the good stuff.

111,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Since i found this place, I've been here so many times, i can't count. This is the very first place, where i take my friends as they come in Amsterdam, its located in its very heart, and i have feeling it is. If you visiting Amsterdam this ‚Ä¶"
112,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Ever heard of Jenever? Probably not. But did you know its the real original Gin?  A very traditional drink in Amsterdam so perfect to really get the full experience. Wynand Fockink is one of the best places to taste some!
113,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Been coming to this old bar for years and never disappointed.  A great range of Genevers and liqueurs as well as beer.  My favourite is the Kensen brandy wine! Make sure you slurp your first mouthful. Really friendly and helpful staff too. ‚Ä¶

118,Wynand Fockink, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Guess I came into this place on the wrong day...I am left wondering now if they are rude to everyone or just people visiting from out of town. I came in interested in a learning experience and instead was misjudged as a barbie doll and made ‚Ä¶
119,Wynand Fockink, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wynand Fockink is in a small alley in the busy district, easy to miss, guess it's one of the best Dutch Gin and Jenever  experience in Amsterdam, over 500 different gins on the shelf waiting you to explore, beside standard gin, quite a few ‚Ä¶"
120,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is where you can try real Dutch liqueurs for a very low price of ‚Ç¨2. Atmosphere is great, staff entertaining (which sometimes makes the queues very long as they answer all the questions anyone has by the bar) and the product excellent. Hidden gem."

124,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really authenintc place to try one or more of their hundreds of tastes of liquors they have. They explain you everything you need and prepared in front of you. After you can drink it outside in a beautiful covered terrace. The location is difficult to find since it is in a small street.
125,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious drinks, and they allow free sampling. Great bartender."
126,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Highly recommend trying ginevre (basically the better gin) - befriend the barman and he'll do a wonderful demo and explanation on it all. Pop over to the shop if you want to buy a bottle as a souvenir. Delicious!

130,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a must when you go to Amsterdam. They have very good choice of drinks, but you need to try their local shots which are so good. I usually take the one with lemon. The place is very tiny but very typical dutch."
131,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Typical Dutch place for genever drinks. Wide selection of flavours,  with a personal crush on the ""non-sweet"" lemon! Super friendly staff, very reasonable pricing (especially for such a central location), it's a fun experience to do!"

137,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What can I say but wow!  The service was great and it's about the learning experience. Hans was fantastic and is clearly an expert in what he does. Keep up the great work and education of the public on Jenever.
138,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really friendly staff. They take the time to explain the different flavours (and let you taste some). I'm not a big drinker but really pleasant to buy a fruit liquor or two!
139,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly, knowledgeable and polyglot staff will good naturedly guide you through the intricacies of jenever (its not gin!) and come up with a few to try. Always a 'must visit' each time I'm in Amsterdam."

164,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It got soul and history dripping from the walls and they still serve Genever with a top on so if you don't want to spill your drink on the bar by lifting the glass ,you have to bend  forward and slurp the first sip. Very old dutch custom"

189,Wynand Fockink, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A cute little tasting tavern where liqueurs and genevers are still being made using the same 17th century traditional craft methods.
