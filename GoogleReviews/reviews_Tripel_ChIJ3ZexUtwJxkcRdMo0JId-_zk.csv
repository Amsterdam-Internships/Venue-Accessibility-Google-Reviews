0,Tripel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really cozy atmosphere and very friendly bartenders! This place has the typical 'bruin café' (brown cafe) feel to it. They have an upstairs area as well, part of which overlooks the ground floor. Their assortment of beers is very extensive. I really recommend anyone to try this place!"
1,Tripel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful! 3rd visit. Went tonight (tuesday) 2 for 1 on steaks,  and just amazing! Chill and homey vibe and very friendly. Value for money would be a great understatment. Must visit for steak and beer lovers!"
2,Tripel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great Belgium beer bar! Such a large variety of beers!
3,Tripel, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Just like its little brother, De Zotte, it has a great beer selection and a reduced but tasty menu. The ambience is very nice and the place ample enough to handle big groups. Proost!"
4,Tripel, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Cozy and warm, this bar has a laid back atmosphere with a great selection of Belgian and Dutch beers. The rock music completes the scene really well"
5,Tripel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great selection, but too hot inside.  Expect 1 bar tender.. but that firey blond needs to be cloned or brain scanned for future robot bar tenders  (or like robo bar assistance).  Bloody hell you need more bartenders and a bigger bloody fan!"
6,Tripel, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Cozy environment and a nice selection of beers (although they usually don't have most of the interesting beers from the menu). The food is good enough.
