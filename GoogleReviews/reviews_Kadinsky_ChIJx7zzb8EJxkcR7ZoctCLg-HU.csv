0,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Really nice popular coffeeshop with good reason! Decent size to sit inside however , the produce is the best, probably a couple of euros cheaper than other spots nearby , really worth going in and having a look. Nice staff and Covid friendly too. Looking forward to coming back again"
1,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"For my friends and me a real insider tip!

Great selection, very friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere. …"
2,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great vibe inside the shop ! The service was excellent and also funny, also nice and warm inside unlike a few where doors are left open."
3,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Comfortable seating on two levels. Well stocked, friendly, knowledgeable staff. Location has a lot of character."
4,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice place, cozy, a bit upscale, big selection"
5,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Kadinsky is definitely my favourite coffeeshop in amsterdam. No matter what location. Staff was always friendly and helpful, it was very clean and you are even able to charge your phone while sitting down!"
6,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great staff and a great place. They also own a bar opposite where you can enjoy your herbs 🍷🇳🇱
7,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good range of flower options at decent prices. Guy working was nice and let us borrow a grinder. Loved the atmosphere and hung out there for a couple hours. Would definitely be my go-to place if I was here longer or lived in the area.
8,Kadinsky, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Had high hopes for this place, it was lovely inside, really nicely done out, like a high end bar, but the atmosphere was whack. The staff were so weird, the tall bald guy stared at us awkwardly until we left, and the curly haired girl who …"
9,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little'local' coffee shop, hidden away on a side street. Often relatively quiet, compared to the tourist hot-spots. Helpful, friendly staff who will help with any questions and a nice chilled vibe. I'm not experienced to comment on the selection or quality, but it worked for me! Did I mention the coffee is pretty good too? 😁"
10,Kadinsky, 1 star ,2 years ago,The place is nice to chill out. The lady in there is unbelievably rude ... Don't have any respect. Was swearing while we were there smoking . She wasn't welcoming only us but other people as well.she was the reason we left.
11,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Goede shop

P.s. to all the foreigners giving bad reviews - it could very well be that you …"
12,Kadinsky, 4 stars ,2 years ago,More urban vibe than some of the other shops as an american coming from new york it felt immediately familiar some of the best bud with heavy hitting strains. Staff was solid though a little more lax in their cleaning
13,Kadinsky, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Since the beginning we arrived, the staff guy looks like homeless with  one not focus eye, super rude and aggresive. Just asked me and my friend to leave just because we bought one joint only but we drink alot, i am not sure racism involved …"
14,Kadinsky, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not even had time to pass my order that the shopkeeper was already not nice talking to me because my girlfriend dared to take a seat while i was ordering...it was not even busy at that moment. So i went to spend my money elsewhere. That s the positive side of the story, i haven t spent one euro there."
15,Kadinsky, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We were here on Saturday morning and the bar girl was really friendly and we absolutely liked the atmosphere, so we decided to came back on Sunday only to get really disappointed.. Never seen such a unfriendly and foreigner hating bartender, she absolutely ruined the experience in here!!!"
16,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Straight off the plane and straight into this place, good selection of weed, neps was lovely, you can buy your weed then nip over the alley to get a beer and smoke in the air conditioned pods. 2 pints was 10 Euro. Laid back happy service. Lovely vibes"
17,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The cake is really tasty and strong, def recommended"
18,Kadinsky, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Weed was good but the lady at the front was rude. Music was really loud and drinks were expensive. We asked for a tap water and we’re told “bars don’t really do that.”
19,Kadinsky, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very poor staff... The ladies don't respect the order of arrival (queue), besides the fact the stuff like safi is miles away from what used to be, the quality went down the drain. …"
20,Kadinsky, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Looks nice but that's all, staff is acting weird. Ordering 3 tea was not possible because she doesn't want to prepare hot drinks?! It's rai ing it's cold and you don't want to do your job? It's tea pls!! Pathetic"
21,Kadinsky, 1 star ,2 years ago,"very small place, triible service. the lady in the front is very rood when you ask her questions or when she wants to explain something.  for sure won't come back abraxas is near and much better"
22,Kadinsky, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Would have gave it 5 star as the weed and the rooms where you sit in are cosy but the woman with the red hair was so rude it was unbelivable. It was like she hates English people as she was nice to locals.
23,Kadinsky, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Great small place. Good service and nice people. good bundle deals. Eclectic crowd and a bit too crowded for my taste. Smoked good sativa and went to my way. Would i come back? If i am in the area shure l why not. But is it my favorite new place? Not realy.
24,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Top place, small but very nice, friendly staff,  good weed and good music, one of my favorite in Ansterdam"
25,Kadinsky, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice bar bought some weed from them it was good and decently priced:) nice wee place although I ordered a caramel latte and instead of coffee got handed a beer with a similar name lol Miscommunication I guess lol
26,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, eat only half of the space cake if you are not experienced 😉 but if you know yourself in this context you might want to eat one and half."
27,Kadinsky, 1 star ,2 years ago,The lady at the till gave the most rude service I have ever experienced. She barely made any effort and was dismissive and gave hateful looks.

32,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Their top products exceed most other coffeeshops, and they also make a good cup of coffee.  I interacted with as many locals as tourists, and they always had great music playing."
33,Kadinsky, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice looking place, however the music was too loud for conversation in the front part. Curly haired bartender was extremely rude"
34,Kadinsky, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place not so busy and music tends to be more laid back would recommend 5 min walk from wax works
35,Kadinsky, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"My girlfriend and I grabbed a space cake to go. We split it and it was more than enough to get us sky high, taste wasn't bad either."
