0,Wheels Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little place on a side street in Amsterdam. Food is excellent, breakfast, brunch, and dinner. Staff is super friendly! A neat touch : they use rugs as table clothes and it makes the place very cozy. Also nice people watching spot, especially when the weather is nice. We live around the corner and we will definitely be back."
