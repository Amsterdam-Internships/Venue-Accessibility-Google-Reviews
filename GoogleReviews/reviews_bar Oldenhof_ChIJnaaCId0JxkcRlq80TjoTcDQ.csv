0,bar Oldenhof, 4 stars ,a week ago,"the place is speakasy. So if you expect super strong cocktails, jazz music and quiet evening then it is place to be. But do not expect good party vibe. The cocktails price is 15€"

5,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious cocktails. Love that they're using the outside as a terrace right now - before this bar was very hidden and could feel inaccessible. Now I can drop by on a sunny day and enjoy the sunshine!

7,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Exquisite drinks for people who appreciate cocktails as an art form. The bartenders are masters of their craft.

11,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Stepping into Bar oldenhof is like stepping into a time machine. Transporting you to a time when waiters offered you water right from the moment you sit down, and continue to keep you hydrated throughout the evening. A time where the jazz …"

20,bar Oldenhof, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice hidden bar but not as great as expected. The cocktails we had, had odd flavours. I would prefer a bar like Tales and Spirits. The prices are the same, about €15 for a cocktail, but we enjoyed the ones at T&S much more. Ps: if you want …"

Find this place, dark and curtained off from the world, ring the doorbell and …"
33,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"very cozy fancy place! Nice creative cocktails, good staffs!"
34,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool speakeasy type bar. Cocktails are great, and they have a wide range of great spirit brands. The atmosphere is chilled and, opposite to many other speakeasies, it's not too noisy, so you can enjoy a good conversation. Would recommend!"
35,bar Oldenhof, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent cocktail bar; top notch drinks list, great service & plush seats. The only reason I've withheld a star is that we had seats right at the end of the bar which meant too much overhearing the bar staff gossip, break glasses. Overall, really worth the trip, especially for couples or a special occasion"
36,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great seasonal cocktails, great staff and very cozy and relaxed atmosphere. They have some area upstairs, but the place is not large and doesn't take large groups - so if you're a group, make sure to book/check in advance. Also allow them some door wait time."
37,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always top quality service, always top quality cocktails. Very unique atmosphere (for Amsterdam), intimate, elegant but still sort of low key. Definitely a place to come back to."
38,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This bar is an experience! Such an amazing time, you feel spoiled and cherished. The gin and tonic is perfect, the bartender is so skilled and nice. Price for a cocktail is 16 euros but it's worth every cent."
39,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of those places you feel you shouldn't review because you don't want to share it with anyone else. A small, intimate, cosy cocktail bar, and owing to the method of entry, it possesses a slightly secluded, private, speakeasy feel. Staff …"
40,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Classical styled bar with interior reminiscent of the old 50s (or 20s?). Vast selection of whiskeys and exquisite cocktails. Very forthcoming and service oriented staff. Team knows their trade very thoroughly and may help alleviate your choice if asked. Great experience.
41,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good cocktails, in a nice cozy and fancy environment.

Cocktails are not cheap (14-16 euro) but definitely recommended!"

43,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a unique bar. Came here around 7pm on Monday and am one of the three customers. The whole place has less than 10 tables I think. It has a second floor attic area. Love the vibe and decent drink menu. …
44,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great experience. Great cocktails, great ambiance and great service. Cocktail selection pretty vast, then some. You can order from the menu or make your own drinks."

49,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoy a well-crafted, unique libation as you swirl from the comfort of a lounge chair with light jazz in the background? This is your spot! Mixologists know their trade very well & are focused on a customer-first experience. You will not regret stopping by!"
50,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place, very polite staff. And the cocktails were really worth the price. I would recommend it and surely i would go there again. It was a bit hard to find but dont give up! Its behind secret curtains. ;)"

53,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A place to savour some cocktails and hold a  conversation.  We each had an amazingly well foamed whiskey sour as our night cap.. all of us were still reminiscing how great it tastes on the following day when we departed Amsterdam. Will return and recommend.
54,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It is one of the best Bar experiences you can have in the city. Perfect for enthusiasts. The owner is amazing and the rest of their staff consists of people who love alcohol. They really know their craft well.
55,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing as always. My all time favourite. For tonight... Female empowerment in prohibition setting. Bo is a top notch mixologist and I'd recommend ordering off menu. Marla is amazing in making you feel at home and as no other communicates …

58,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This hidden gem is so delightful. The cocktail are amazing. The atmosphere is wonderful. You have to know where this bar is and then ring the bell to be let in. It's a great secret place.
59,bar Oldenhof, 1 star ,3 years ago,Bad customer service!! I mean I am from Amsterdam so I know how bad it can get but this experience was really the worst I have ever had! We were having cocktails of 15 euro’s a piece and a friend of ours wanted to join us. He was not let …

63,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A real speakeasy bar, with highly skilled bartenders and service. You'll jump back in time, and get in a bar from the Thirties. Service talks to you in a special way, places are limited cos you have quite some room between tables, …"

67,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"There are a handful of great cocktail bars in amsterdam and this is one of them. This is setup a bit classier than some of the others, somewhat of a 1950's and chesterfield chairs look. The owner is really friendly and service oriented."
68,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Apart from the best whiskey sour I had, bartender and waitress was so nice. Classy ambiance. Deserves more than 5 star!"

72,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Beautiful space and really excellent cocktails
73,bar Oldenhof, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Decent cocktails and friendly staff. The atmosphere looked nice downstairs but upstairs where we were placed was a bit lacking (being right next to the toilets didn't help).

75,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A great alternative to a loud and lively bar. If you want to chill and chat this the place. It's a very cosy place. Cocktails are made well by a very friendly and formal bar man.
76,bar Oldenhof, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I went here based on the high ratings. And it was quite disappointing. The place was empty and it took about 40 minutes to get a drink delivered to my table. After the ridiculous wait, we decided to leave and go somewhere else. The drinks …"

86,bar Oldenhof, 5 stars ,a year ago,Marla is the best!!!!  Very amazing cocktails. Great interior and atmosphere. Perfect service
87,bar Oldenhof, 1 star ,4 years ago,Find hard to understand why this is rated as one of the best cocktail bars in the city. Makes me think their customers are easily impressed by arrogant staff and basic standards.

89,bar Oldenhof, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Place is overrated and overpriced. 16€ for a cocktail with a very poor service for us as the waiter was nervous and full of himself. I do not recommend this place if you only have a few days in town.
90,bar Oldenhof, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I literally just went to this bar on a recommendation for the area after a meal elsewhere. Sadly, I didn't get to try any drinks as the staff that greeted me inside rudely told me that they don't allow shorts or 'sneakers' whilst they …"
