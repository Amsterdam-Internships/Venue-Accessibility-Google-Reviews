0,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"My friend and I went to Loetje on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was quite busy, however we got a nice spot and an amazing service. As we were in a hurry, because of needing to leave to the airport, the waiters understood and helped us ‚Ä¶"
1,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great food and. Very friendly and helpful staff!
2,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,a week ago,Great service and yummy food!
3,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"A good place for business meetings in Zuidas. However the food is rather disappointing. 17 eur salmon salad with mixed greens and salmon. For me personally, I expect to eat at a restaurant something that I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be able to ‚Ä¶"
4,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Good food and great staff. Our favorite: meat with Bali sauce.
5,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"It was a delicious experience.
I had a XL steak smothered in Bali (spicy) gravy and a stack of fresh white bread to soak up all the lovely flavours."
6,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A wide range of choices on the menu. The vegan burger looks interesting. The beef salad is pretty good, lots of small cut steaks and greens. Looks much better than the steak we ordered - a lonely steak soaked in gravy on the plate.. many side dishes to choose from, taste pretty plain. I like the interior design."
7,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice restaurant with good food and nice selection of beers to choose from. Overall a good experience. ‚Ä¶
8,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing steak and loved their Loetje sauce! Very surprised by the bread, but I won't spoil too much. It was really busy, almost too busy. The staff was friendly and could keep up alright. ‚Ä¶"
9,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a chicken salad, tuna steak, liver and schnitzel. All of them were really nice, the quality and quantity were generous. Good selection of beers and the interior is pretty spacious and gives you the feeling of the good life. Highly recommended!!"
10,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Beautifully decorated and spacious. Fair prices with good portions!! Lovely atmosphere and great staff! Nothing to complain about
11,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,a year ago,"It's Loetje - if you like steak, you'll have a good time. The meals are big and tasty, yet it's not the place for culinary masterpieces or more adventurous foodies. An extra star for proper corona-safety measures & proper distance between the tables."
12,Loetje Zuidas, 1 star ,6 months ago,Unfortunately the waitress was very unfriendly. We didn't had a reservation and just wanted to get a coffee. I had the feeling she was annoyed of us being guests because there were already a lot of customers in the restaurant. ‚Ä¶
13,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super friendly staff, great New Zealand white wine.
Always love the steak in gravy. The restaurant located in an awesome spot in  Amsterdam south! Parking and train station nearby."
14,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Finally have a chance to try ‚ÄúLoetje‚Äù after i heard years of nice words. But, If you come here especially for the steak, it will definitely disappoint you. It was called ‚ÄúBest steak in Nederland‚Äù but it turns out to be only at average ‚Ä¶"
15,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,a week ago,Good restaurant with standard dishes. Good food but nothing extraordinary.
16,Loetje Zuidas, 1 star ,5 months ago,Great restaurant. But on Saturday night not having the enough staff and denying entry seems not professional at all. Even more rude the fact that after being denied coming in and waiting outside for a minute more people came inside the ‚Ä¶
17,Loetje Zuidas, 1 star ,a month ago,They ask for medical records in order to have a coffee. Obeying discriminating rules and asking private info is never the way to do business.
18,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,a year ago,Tried the tenderloin with the Loetje sauce. Most likely will come again to eat this excellent dish! Service could be faster (I don‚Äôt like waiting 10-15 mins for a menu to be shared) but I guess businesses are getting used to the post Covid shutdown crowds and way of working.
19,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good variety of food, decent sized, and expertly cooked... In particular the beef. It's their sportcity, so, you cabify go wing with it!"
20,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,9 months ago,They say steak here is supposed to be famous but it was just a regular steak that had no flavor whatsoever brought up in a juice of fat given with grocery store white bread.  I was disappointed and don't really recommend it if you are a ‚Ä¶
21,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 months ago,Same quality. Price is right. When take out they make it fresh after you arrive for pick up.
22,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice signature ""beefsteak"", which is a medium rare (you have no choice) filet mignon sitting in a sea of ""jus"". They give you slices of bread on the side to help soak up the salty buttery goodness that you otherwise miss just dunking your bites into. EUR 18 for this side junk of steak is pretty unheard of in Europe."
23,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Very nice food, comfy. I recommend the rump steak."
24,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Besides their famously know steak in the Netherlands, they also have a wide range of vegetarian options. Next to that the staff is also very polite. They also have a very nice terrace where, if the sun is shining, you can enjoy the weather to the maximum. So definitely highly recommended!"
25,Loetje Zuidas, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Diarrhea, vomiting, High temperature, couldn't leave my bed the next day, I had the steak with onion and chicken liver and bacon, it was yummy but I never was this sick after a meal... We loved the place and the service but they need to do something about the hygiene or something"
26,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The steak was subpar and not worth the price. I didn't understand or enjoy the pool of grease on the plate, it was far too salty and unappetizing. Some of the staff seemed apathetic, especially the guy at the counter. ‚Ä¶"
27,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"A big branch of the Loetje franchise with the well known steak.
Be ready to wait in line, it is usually very busy."
28,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food at reasonable prices - love their sandwiches! the location is very nice as well, make sure to get a seat on the terrace:)"
29,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This Loetje is exceedingly spatious compared to other Loetjes I've visited in the city. There are multiple areas, including one with water outlook. I had pork schnitzel and sauteed mushrooms. Big portions as is usual for Loetjes. Pork could've been a bit softer at a Loetje's. Mishrooms were good. All in all 4/5."
30,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Bad experience as we made a reservation and when arrived we asked for a table outside. One of the waitress told it s not possible to sit outside, without giving any reasoning and then continued to say that their terrace was shut. This was ‚Ä¶"

32,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good location, good service (free tapwater excellent), nice menu, good food. Only reason no 5 stars is the fact they don't seem to use biological meat, plus I saw veal"
33,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Portions are very big, but food was okay, not great. Dessert was bad."
34,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I generally love Loetje.
The personal it's very nice and friendly here but the meat doesn't came how we ordered so this was disappointing and sometimes we had to wait a lot for drinks. ‚Ä¶"
35,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great place, with a lot of space with a lot of availability of uninterrupted sun light! üåû if you are looking for a nice terrace right next to a water channel with a lot of sun, in the best and newest district of Amsterdam, then that's your place!! Last but not least, great service üëçüëè"

37,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"It was a very nice experience.  We went for the first time at that time.  It was the weekend and it was crowded.  But the service was very  well done.  We were hungry and we liked the food and also Amstel. Everything was fine, thank you..."
38,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Good quality food, steak comes with good gravy."
39,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Steak, liver, bacon and onions. Need I say more? That's what I thought. Better get over here and try it. Order some white bread on the side to soak up all the juices."
40,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Wow ... best steak ever! Can not wait to come again next week!
41,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice venue. Ok food. Grumpy staff.
42,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic food! The steak is an absolute must eat!
43,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff, yummy food and great interior! I‚Äôll definitely come back."
44,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The biefstuk was delicious and the service was great. Also reasonable prices. Definite recommend
45,Loetje Zuidas, 1 star ,a year ago,"Disappointing and rude service! We got all the courses late! the fries arrived with the starter by a mistake and we returned it of course. The main course was late, however, the fries and the mushroom side dish were brought when we almost ‚Ä¶"
46,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice steakhouse in the middle of Zuidas business area. The staff is super friendly and the restaurant itself looks gorgeous. The food is fine and not too pricey. You don't need to make a reservation and if too crowded you can have a very ‚Ä¶

49,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great steaks. Definitely a try worth

Quality-price ratio is good, friendly staff.

51,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice restaurant and tasty meals. They have a signature steak which is a tad on the small side but good. ‚Ä¶
52,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loetje is chain of restaurants specializing in the most tender steaks. The food is straightforward, steak and fries is their most famous dish but there are a few other choices available. Ambiance is casual but pretty nice. Ideal for a ‚Ä¶"
53,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best steaks I have had in my life. My wife absolutely loved it.  My son bragged about his meal also. Great beer. Great staff who were very patient with us. Cant say enough about the quality of the food. Got breat to make sure no juice was left over or wasted. We will go back here again next time we travel here.
54,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Very understaffed, if you aren‚Äôt aggressively getting the attention of the waitrons you will not be served. Never nice being constantly ignored in a restaurant. Food is nice, wine menu requires some work."
55,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"You wouldn't expect this since this place looks fancy and is located in a fancy area. But, it's nice, cheap and fancy ;)
I like the balcony area where you can sit and enjoy a bit of view esp if the ‚Ä¶"
56,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Menu listed weekly vegetarian special, but none available when visiting. Other vegetarian options on menu were underwhelming. Fries were standard quality,  maybe just go with the steak or not at all."
57,Loetje Zuidas, 1 star ,2 years ago,I can't say I liked the food. Maybe because it was a crowded night or something. And the kitchen was in a hurry. But everything was dripping fat. It looked like the schnitzel was re-heated by dropping it with the frites for some seconds. ‚Ä¶
58,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good service and spacious inside. Some tables outside. As well as steaks there is a nice selection of other dishes. Toilets were very clean.
59,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Frustrating. I had the tenderloin steak with mushrooms and fries. My frustration was over the really quite excessive amount of fat/oil in the gravy. But for that, it would have been an excellent meal; the steak itself was tender, tasty, and ‚Ä¶"
60,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The famous Loetje-steaks at the hotspot of Amsterdam: Zuidas. Within easy reach from Centrum with bike, bus or tram and even train."
61,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was fantastic! Sitting by the canal in Amsterdam south was excellent
62,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We went here after a recommendations by a local colleague. Steaks were phenomenal at a very decent price level - try the ""Bali Steak"", which comes with a more spicy gravy. Sides are very large so that you can easily share 1 portion (e.g., fries) between 2 people."

64,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,a year ago,I don't know why but my review didn't get published. Food wise the restuarant was very very good but from a service point of view it could have been much better. I was here with a very good friend of mine who was making sure that I try and ‚Ä¶
65,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I've walked by this restaurant tens of times as my Uni is around the corner.  It always looked busy inside, however, I was unsure whether that was more of a function of its convenient location or its food.I stopped in one night with my ‚Ä¶"
66,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent restaurant in the business district of Amsterdam. The food here is reasonably priced and of high quality. Staff is  friendly,  cosy outdoor seating areas are provided. Overall, definitely worth going."
67,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Friendly service, good location...but average food (had the chicken sandwich, orange juice, and fries)"
68,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best steak in town
69,Loetje Zuidas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Price/ quality inadequate. Reasonable food, but nothing special for the price they charge. Meat without any side-dish, so I took fries. Pre fried industrial ones, no taste. ‚Ä¶"
70,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,we went for a family gathering with colleagues. The atmosphere was nice. A bit loud but still nice. The staff were very nice and accomodating. We had the steak with gravy sauce. Quite average.
71,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place for after-work. Excellent service, very decent portions - I haven't seen salad where half the dish is crunchy and well prepared meat. A bit too salty but matches perfectly with beer! A candidate for another visit."
72,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The food was excellent. It was a bit noisy. We were sat in the center. That might be the cause. Great atmosphere. Very popular and well known for their stake and gravy type sauce.
73,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Special and the steak is delicious
I loved that ü•©"
74,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Super food, especially the vegga burger and homemade fries. Very vibrant crowd and the place is walking distance from Zuid station . Service is good but can be a bit tad better. Make sure you account for waiting time as the place is always full."
75,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing meat and other food options. Huge menu. Very family friendly. Always provide crayons and a drawing paper for my toddler. Also always listen to our dietary and intolerance requests. Very patient and friendly staff.
76,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What can I say other than Loetje's steaks are amazing! Don't look at any other part of the menu. Just get the biefstuk, fries, and a side salad (and ask for the white bread to soak up the extra Buttery sauce). Grab a beer or three to go with it and get ready to launch yourself as close to heaven as is possible without actually dying."
77,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic, prices are fair, staff are great and the food will have you dreaming

We all had the steak with the famous Loetje sauce all over, my mouth is watering ‚Ä¶"
78,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice location and cousy. Everything was very clean. The food was tasty but not special. In my opinion slightly overpriced for what you get. The staff was friendly and attentive. 1 tip though: write down who ordered what so you do not have to ask  everytime.
79,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic steak! Livly atmosphere and good service. Big portions though so watch out if you want to try different dishes.
80,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great cocktails! (I recommend you the Cinnamon Sour! The other ones are great aswell!!!) The steaks are the best I‚Äôve ever had. Great service at the table.
81,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice trendy version of a Dutch institution. Food was just as tasty as the original. Staff wasn't very friendly or attentive, but that is to be expected in Amsterdam."
82,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food is great and service is good. Bali steak is delicious. Order it with some white bread for the sauce. I strongly recommend reserving a table
83,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food and great service. The gravy was really delicious!
84,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It was a little bit messy,  some mistakes in our order.  But the steak at Loetje never disappoints!! Food was great!! I prefer the ambiance at their other restaurants."
85,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First I was here just for a coffee, the second time I actually ate here and the food was perfect! Ask for some slices of bread with your Ossenhaas to eat of the remaining gravy, delicious!"
86,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Haven't eaten there yet but is a great place for a beer on the terrace. Service can be slow at peak periods but overall a pleasant place to relax.
87,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, I'm not really a fan of steak so I chose the schnitzel and that was a good choice. I understand the ""hype"" about Loetje, but it's not for me."
88,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I was only there to drink. Spacious, handily close to the university, reasonable selection of drinks. Some snacks. Selection of outdoor seating."
89,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Ver great food, great service and good stuff.
The only one downside is that we had to wait few minutes to find a table, but knowing the restaurant popularity, that should be okay."
90,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Loetje is always a good no nonsense place when one likes steak...French fries and a salad...the meat is good...service left some things to be desired...drinks came very late...bread is just from an industrially packaged loaf of bread...room for improvement...
91,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food is really good. Big portions so consider sharing. Service is good and staff speak fluent English. Nice decor and super clean restrooms add to the nice experience.
92,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's practically impossible giving a loetje low ratings, as I expected, the food is delicious, the staff is nice, and the location good. Almost five stars I'd say."
93,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I would say 5 for the place itself, it is nice and fresh, however, at time noisy. For the food i would say 4, not bad and not something that makes you to say WoW, priced very average for Amsterdam."
94,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"While on business I stumbled this restaurant. I could not be happier with the service, decor, menu selection, and quality. I have found a new favorite in the Zuid business district."
95,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely steaks excellent service and atmosphere. 3.60.for chips that you.need to.order as a side a nothing accompanies the rather small steak missed the 5 rating
96,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,a month ago,Tasty and great view
97,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent steak in a spicy gravy full of far eastern flavors.  Make sure you book early cause this place is always full.
98,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Atmosphere is awesome. Food is fine
99,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,7 months ago,The service here was pretty good although a bit crass at times. The food however was incredible.
100,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Great lunch options and seating location
101,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It has classic Loetje menu but the location itself is nice. Close to Amsterdam Zuid station and the restaurant is new & specious. Staff are always nice.
102,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice food, many choices. Good atmosphere, great service. I recommend the tuna steak!"
103,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food. The Ossehaas is the best. You get a very Large order of fries and applesauce. Enough to be shared by 2
104,Loetje Zuidas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite a big restaurant but still feels cosy. The famous steak was as good as everyone says it is, although maybe that jus is even better."
105,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"White bread, gravy and an excellent steak. Simple yet perfect!

Loetje knows how to do it right!"
106,Loetje Zuidas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best steaks in town! The zuidas branch is a modern one, right in the middle of the financial district in Amsterdam."

116,Loetje Zuidas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Well it's okay. Steak was good and you get some juice from it but still have soom room left. Downside is the timeslot
