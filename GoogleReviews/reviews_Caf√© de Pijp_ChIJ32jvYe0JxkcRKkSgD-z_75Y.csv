0,Caf√© de Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best breakfast coffee in Depijp area. the restaurant is cool , the staff is just amazing and friendly . The terrasse is so great to eat outside enjoying the sun . …"
1,Caf√© de Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very fresh tender salmon, surprisingly served with noodle and vegetables. Very big portion of spareribs in delicious taste. They also have interesting beers to.choose."
2,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Loved the atmosphere. Definitely a local place. Surrounded by local people speaking Dutch. The Mediterranean platter was delish. I only give it a 4 because the sweet potato and mustard soup wasn't to my liking. A few local biers on tap which were tasty.
3,Caf√© de Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super! We ordered chicken legs, grill chicken salads and panini. All are so amazing! Its tase is yummy. It was a little bit busy. Great location"
4,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic service, great vibe and good food. Really enjoyed the atmosphere. We had bitterballen, steak and burger. Steak was fantastic but burger could've been better."
5,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was great, however service was very slow and the place wasn't particularly busy. Took ages for food to come out and to get the bill, seems more staff members are needed, wouldn't suggest coming here if very hungry (as I was). Luckily the food tasted nice, but it may have even be the hunger that was deceiving me....."
6,Caf√© de Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a lovely corner cafe!  Their waffle with strawberries and whipped cream is so good.  Service is fast. Staff is super nice.
7,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Just what you expect from a bar/restaurant. Beer and some food options. Not so many food options (at the moment). But well look on the bright side, this makes cuts down on the thinking and thus faster to order."
8,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice neighborhood pub feel - good service and  selection of beers and cocktails
9,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It is a cozy little cafe close to the heineken experience . We wanted to grab coffee after the heineken tour and decided to stop by here for a small bite. Not to mention, it definitely exceeded our expectations and the hosts were also very nice to the guests"
10,Caf√© de Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Was torn between this Ginger or O'Donnell's around the corner. Took a chance of Cafe De Pijp and absolutely loved it. Fast, friendly service and the food was delicious! Had the beefburger and fries and even the side salad was delicious! My …"
11,Caf√© de Pijp, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was decent,  would not recomand as it is quite pricey for the quality. Also, we waited around 1 hour for our pretty basic order to come (burgers, fries, soup). Atmosphere is nice, has a dutch specific feeling."
12,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cute place in a lovely neighborhood. Ordered a sharing meat platter which was delicious maybe the ribs were a little underdone …
13,Caf√© de Pijp, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent service with a smile! Good food, casual and cozy. A little cold in October, but that's why you bring your loved one or a coat. You won't go wrong with the ribs or the steak."
14,Caf√© de Pijp, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Don't look any further than this review. Our group of six were there on August 16, 2018. Service was inattentive. Four of six meals were sent back (a first for any of us)--fish smelled bad and undercooked ribeyes looked like skirt steak. …"
15,Caf√© de Pijp, 1 star ,3 years ago,I wanted to like this place based on the menu but unfortunately my recommendation is to avoid this restaurant. The service is painfully slow. Our food took very very long to come out and our drink order was forgotten. …
16,Caf√© de Pijp, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"A bad experience. This café has potential but with the wait time for food being too long, and bad customer service it just doesn't deliver. The food was good, but with everything else in mind, it just wasn't a good experience. …"
17,Caf√© de Pijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service, quick and efficient. Staff were friendly, helpful and attentive but not pushy. Food was delicious and the portion sizes were above average. Prices were average - definitely worth the money. My coffee was lovely and the …"
18,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited here for a few drinks while out and about in Amsterdam.  Good vibe to the place, and for the football fans they had the Champions league game on (so we avoided it then).  Place got fairly busy on Saturday night as you'd expect but we still managed to find a place to sit outside."
19,Caf√© de Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place to have a drink and snacks. The guy behind the bar is one of my favorite servers in the city! Nice spread of beers & they play soccer on the main matches.
20,Caf√© de Pijp, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Only got a chance to order drinks. Staff never came back to take our food order even though we told them we just needed some time to figure out what we wanted to eat as they didn't have a lot of veggie nor DUTCH things on the menu and my …
21,Caf√© de Pijp, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Awful customer service. I asked for my steak sandwich to be cooked really well done as I'm pregnant. When it was served, it was red with blood dripping out the sandwich. The waitress said the chef wouldn't cook it well done as it's …"
22,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We had very good food and service. It was cozy enough, but a bit cold in the winter because people would leave the door open going in and out, despite a curtain to stave off the wind a bit. I would recommend it. It's a very convenient location for dinner."

24,Caf√© de Pijp, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Would not come back to this place if my life depended on it. I got charged the full price for a drink half of the size of another customers. When I asked them what the reason was, they responded with ""It's because of the ice"". My drink was …"

30,Caf√© de Pijp, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Bad service. Had to wait for 10 minutes just to get a menu (the place was empty), The stuff looks like they don't really want to work, I simply left. No reason to sit there, many great places around."
31,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little hangout for some apps (although they do have a full menu), glass of wine, cocktail, or a cold beer. There is also some outdoor seating available."
32,Caf√© de Pijp, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Disappointed by the food and by the service, while we were the only table in the whole place. Ribs were undercooked and not tender, service took long and was not very attentive. Sad to see, used to be a fine place."
33,Caf√© de Pijp, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good value for money, limited choices, but what they serve is really good. Lovely Interior design and nice terrace. Near some places as the flowermarket and the Heineken Experience."
