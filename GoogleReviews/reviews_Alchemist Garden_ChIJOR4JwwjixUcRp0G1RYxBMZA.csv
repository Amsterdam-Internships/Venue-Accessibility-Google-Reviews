21,Alchemist Garden, 1 star ,3 years ago,This restaurant serves very small portions of food. My girlfriend and I ordered 3 main dishes and we still had to eat somewhere else after. The prices are ridiculous for what you get. Don't go there If you're hungry. the raw dog is really ‚Ä¶

25,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Delicious raw vegan food but don't go hungry. Food is delicate and with high quality ingredients but you will have to order multiple items in order to be satiated if you are a typical eater. I eat much less than most do and was still quite hungry.
26,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Whilst in Amsterdam we decided to find raw vegan cafes. This place is cute and they have lots of raw options and the menu actually reflects their ethos. I had a really tasty hazelnut chocolate milk drink which I could have drank over and ‚Ä¶

30,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent taste, especially the deserts. All gluten free and vegan. Big eaters be aware to order a bit more ;)"
31,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Relaxed atmosphere, and a great place to stop off from wondering around the large park. Friendly service, and my girlfriend and I enjoyed both the lasagne and club sandwiches. Prices were fair! Treat yourself to a smoothie, because Alchemist Garden do a wonderful job with those."
32,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I came here, despite bad reviews, I was greeted by one of the most warm individuals I had come across throughout my whole trip-and believe me that trip I met some warm funky people! ;). She knew I was hungry and as I was so indecisive she ‚Ä¶"

Ordered smoothies, breakfast plate and avocado and got served with 2 teas ‚Ä¶"
35,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A quirky chilled out place, with some unique raw food choices. Relatively pricey for small portions. It‚Äôs quite small so when busy the service can take a long time. Nevertheless the staff were friendly and accommodating, and it was worth the experience."
36,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved this place! everything was made with love and super fresh! Was there twice in 3 days :) - totally recommend to raw food lovers and not only and will come back once in Amsterdam.

38,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great flavors yet portions are small like mentioned by other costumers. Would go back because the food was delicious. The place has a relaxed atmosphere!
39,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super delicious, very friendly place and people!"
40,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious vegan food. Super slow service because they make everything to order and it's usually just one or two people working there. You can sit inside or outside. They also have some vegan food and health products for purchase.
41,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this place. Good vibes, healthy products. Really focused on Raw. Nice raw pie's, chocolats. Try the chaga or kefir. Love their products of Raja nature and Lola's alchemy. On Saturday evening there is a dj and there are quite a few activities."
42,Alchemist Garden, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Smoothies were amazing and had a great time until the barista, who had taken our order earlier, started to insult me and my friend in (terrible) Spanish to his coworker. He thought we wouldn't understand. Too bad for him I will never come back as much as I liked the drinks."

45,Alchemist Garden, 1 star ,2 years ago,Totally overrated. Portions are very small and expensive. It took an hour to get a bun and a club sandwich (aka tomato&lettuce salad on a stick). How can raw food take so long to be prepared and be so expensive?
46,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Came here a bunch of times while in Amsterdam. It was nice to try a lot of the menu and read from the little library they have. Service can be slow at times but that's okay. Everything made from scratch. Thanks for the meals!
47,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is so good you‚Äôll want to try everything! And feel gorgeous after each dish. Ps they have organic wine
48,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"+Delicious food.

-Service is a bit slow ‚Ä¶"
49,Alchemist Garden, 1 star ,2 years ago,"In one word, abysmal. unhygienic place, smallest portions, overpriced, bizarre atmosphere, service too.. was feeling physicslly unwell after eating/ drinking here. Don‚Äôt like to be rude, but this was just far below par."
50,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was very tasty (I‚Äôm not even vegetarian). Keep in mind the portions are small and they are slow preparing the food, still I would recommend it."
51,Alchemist Garden, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The entire place is raw food, so nothing here is cooked. I didn't get that but that's my bad. ‚Ä¶"
52,Alchemist Garden, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Smoothie was tasty but somehow pricey. Also size of our order was mixed (we got bigger and paid for bigger). Smoothie wasn't cold (perhaps on purpose?)
53,Alchemist Garden, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The food is really tasty. However the service might have been better : nobody came to us and we had to order inside. Portions small so quite pricey.
54,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cute little cafe especially in the summer when you can sit outside. I‚Äôve only tried the smoothies and they were good! You can buy superfoods and other supplements at the cafe!
55,Alchemist Garden, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Slow cooking. High prices. Not tasty. 25 minutes for cooking something called ""raw dog"" - small tasteless dish for 8 euro."
56,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Finally a place with real food! Everything is homemade and natural.

70,Alchemist Garden, 1 star ,2 years ago,It smells weird inside. There were loooots of flies around. The drinks were served with the flies inside as well so we left the restaurant.
71,Alchemist Garden, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Not the best experience,  I wasn't really looked after as they have just opened,  ordering food seemed like a problem to them. The food wasn't very good."

80,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,5 years ago,It is a good alternative if you want to add some veggies and fruits to your diet. Prices are high for the portion they offer.

88,Alchemist Garden, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really healthy and delicious food, no fake vegan staffs"
89,Alchemist Garden, 1 star ,4 years ago,I felt the the vegan pizza was expensive and was a snack rather than healthy wholesome vegan meal.
90,Alchemist Garden, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Would have given them 5 stars however they were out of a lot of items when I visited.
