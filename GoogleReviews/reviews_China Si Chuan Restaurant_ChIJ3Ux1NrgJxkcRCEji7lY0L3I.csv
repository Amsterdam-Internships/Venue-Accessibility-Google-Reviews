64,China Si Chuan Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is by far my most favorite restaurant in Amsterdam. The best place to get good sichuan food at a very reasonable price.

89,China Si Chuan Restaurant, 5 stars ,8 months ago,This place was amazing when I went there in 06 and still remember how delicious the food was.

100,China Si Chuan Restaurant, 1 star ,4 years ago,BEWARE! Ordered seabass and they added dory (i terribly dislike dory) to the dish. When we complained  the manager insisted it was only seabass. Shortly later she came back and said the kitchen added another type of fish as the seabass was too small!!! The dory was added as extra to the seabass! Win liao lo!
