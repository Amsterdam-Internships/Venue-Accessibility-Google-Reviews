0,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Super cozy coffee spot and great atmosphere. Very very good food in great quantities. I really recommend the banana cake and the coconut tart! Had a lovely time.
1,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,When I did stay in Amsterdam I had a great breakfast here. The coffee was super nice and the pancakes were super tasty. Thank you for the friendly service! Will come back any time I am in the area again.

5,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food (all vegan), generous portions and friendly service! They have baked goods, cakes, good coffee and a variety of lunch options. I saw they do high tea as well which I thought was quite affordable. I will definitely come back again."
6,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,a year ago,We came here for a vegan breakfast and what else can we say? We had an amazing breakfast! Also gluten-free and everything is selfmade and made with love. The cakes and the options of the meals makes every vegan heart beat faster. The ‚Ä¶
7,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Had the tempeh sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. big portion and diverse side that comes with it
8,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm as far from vegan as it gets, but I thoroughly enjoyed their pancakes, scones and a smoothie. We had a Vegan Break-Fest for two and while it wasn't too much and was a bit pricey (27‚Ç¨) it was still enough for a good breakfast. I'm definitely not turning vegan, but I liked the ""home"" vibe of the place."
9,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food did NOT disappoint. We had an amazing, healthy vegan breakfast here. The meals were satisfying and delicious which can sometimes be a hard combination to find. We got the buckwheat pancakes and the fig and cashew cheese bread with ‚Ä¶"
10,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for vegan breakfast ü•û we had the large breakfast for 2 hungry vegans and we weren‚Äôt disappointed üòä tasty food, ample choice of sweet and savory.
The staff is really nice and friendly too! Great way to start the day. ‚Ä¶"
11,Beter & Leuk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If you're looking for a healthy, authentic breakfast where the locals come, it's here. Just be prepared for a very limited menu based on the availability of local ingredients. It's small and quaint and was a nice experience. But again, a limited menu and all very health conscious. Caters to vegans."
12,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hands down the best vegan/vegetarian restaurant in Amsterdam. Even if you‚Äôre not a vegetarian, you should definitely try this place. We had the tempeh sandwich and the vegan rendang, both were delicious. I would especially recommend the rendang. They have a pretty decent Matcha latte as well."
13,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute, retro, relaxed, veggie cafe with vegan & gluten-free options. The menu is simple but well crafted. I wanted the bibimbap but sadly they'd sold out (must be popular) so I opted for the weed burger which was delicious! It came with ‚Ä¶"

Atmosphere is cosy. Staff is super friendly and helpful."
16,Beter & Leuk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice cafe with simple menu including some healthy items. Good gluten-free options. Menu items a little small and smoothie bowl was quite runny but had nice toppings. Little shop with clothes and accessories in corner.

18,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great vegetarian/vegan breakfast/brunch/lunch/early dinner place in Amsterdam East. Been coming here ever since they opened and still enjoying the food and beverages they serve. Beter & Leuk is a sweet little place, that offers healthy meal ‚Ä¶"
19,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Very cosy place, with quick friendly service and delicious vegan breakfast and lunch options!

I can also highly recommend the mango smoothie, so fresh and delicious. :) I will be back!"

21,Beter & Leuk, 1 star ,8 months ago,I never had such a bad experience before. The waiter was extremely overstrained. We waited 15min for him to take our order. It took him 20min to prepare a smoothie. We reminded him that we also ordered a Kombucha- there are two types- he ‚Ä¶
22,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Such a cozy place with extremely friendly staff. Amazing place for a vegan lunch or cake. Love that they have a little shop in the back with unique items for sale.

32,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place, nice and cozy. The menu is all vegan except for one dish, so you can say it's a non-vegan friendly place. The hot drinks came with a small piece of a very good carrot cake. The breakfast for 2 was excellent. The stuff was nice and friendly."
33,Beter & Leuk, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Great food still but since it‚Äôs changed hands it lacks all the character and cosines it‚Äôs once had which is a real shame.

35,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beter and Leuk has wonderful and healthy breakfast options. It has a relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. Their croissants are absolutely mind blowing, and their savoury sandwiches are just as satisfying. Best place to have a vegan ‚Ä¶"
36,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The menu is offering almost any meal in a gluten-free version, so there are many opportunities. The food was very delicious. I can recommend the buckwheat pancakes - the most fluffiest pancakes I ever had!"
37,Beter & Leuk, 1 star ,8 months ago,Nice cozy decor but extremely bad customer service. The tall girl who helped us at casa was unbelievably rude and arrogant. We've never felt we're being welcomed for a single moment. I'll never visit again.
38,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Really nice coffee! I live close so this will definitely become my new coffee spot. Also the food looks super delicious, but still need to try. Will update soon..."

40,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ate a breakfast here. The atmosphere is great, cozy and almost like in someone's living room. The vegan foods are delicious. Highly recommend if you are a vegan and in the neighbourhood looking for breakfast/brunch/lunch, they have many things to choose from."
41,Beter & Leuk, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Nice food. Extremely bad customer experience.

43,Beter & Leuk, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"The food was really good but the blonde tall girl was rude to us and we did not felt welcome she was not only stressed she was also rude.
Not recommended if you don't want your vibes to be ruined."
44,Beter & Leuk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Super-super nice food with a Korean twist! Highly recommend. However, make sure you double-check if you receive the food you actually ordered. My friend and I both have gluten intolerance, and inquired about gluten free options upon ‚Ä¶"

46,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Honestly when me and my husband ordered the vegan breakfast for two, we didn't think it would fill us up from looks, but it did! It tasted better than it looked and we were stuffed by the end of it.
P.S. he eats alot"
47,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Gorgeous cafe with lovely staff ‚Äì I had a latte with oat milk, a spinach pancake with roasted veg and an oat scone with coconut cream and jam, it was all fantastic.

55,Beter & Leuk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Small, cosy place. It wasn't too busy on a Wednesday afternoon, so I like that, also not noisy. Waitress was pleasant and prices were okay.

59,Beter & Leuk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,This place is nice and cozy but average at best.  If you are looking for a cute place to have coffee or tea B&L does the trick but we wont be returning for brunch. The menu is small and we ended up waiting over 25minutes for our food and the portions were very small. We left hungry.

64,Beter & Leuk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"What a lovely caf√© in the neighbourhood of de Pijp in Amsterdam! Great place to drink coffee or grab a bite if you're in the area.

65,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this little vegetarian place with almost everything vegan as well! Like sitting in the living room of your very urban friend. The Dutch would describe it as 'gezellig'.. cosy. They have free WiFi, large pots of tea with banana bread. ‚Ä¶"
66,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delightful caf√© with many GLUTEN FREE options. The Buckwheat pancakes are nutty, crispy and full of cinnamon. The service is friendly and the prices reasonable. Highly recommend!"
67,Beter & Leuk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty desserts and hot chocolate. They don‚Äôt serve lunch meals after 4 pm. So expect that many positions on the menu will be over by this time.

75,Beter & Leuk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Whatever we ate was tasty, vegan chocolate brownie was delicious. Negatives were that they didn't have what we wanted to eat and there wasn't much for kids and we feel it was little overpriced"
76,Beter & Leuk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,When I visit this place I want to eat everything that is on the menu and buy all the nice things in their little shop-in-caf√©. The food is mostly organic and/or grown locally.
