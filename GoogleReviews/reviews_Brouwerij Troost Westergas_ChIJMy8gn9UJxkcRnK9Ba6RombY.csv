0,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"A great bar to have a burger with some beers. The service is nice, they made a mistake with our order and they were nice and gave us a free round of drinks. The fries are super nice"
1,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"The beers and the place are great. But this place used to have my favourite burguer in the whole world, the ""Italian"", it was amazingly good. Now it's gone and the vegetarian version is just sad, and the sides that come with it even more sad. Please bring back the old Italian, i miss it."
2,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,a month ago,Super lazy guys. We asked for a table to sit for 30 minutes. Time 16.40 and tables reserved for 18.00 plus few tables empty. They said they cannot serve us because all is reserved. Asked for options - nothing is possible. They didn‚Äôt even ‚Ä¶
3,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,a week ago,Located in the lively part of Westerpark nestled along with several other bars. Must go if you love fresh beer - they are a microbrewery who brew on their premises and also have several beers available on tap and bottle. Only downside for ‚Ä¶
4,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Returning after lockdown to discover the restaurant had gone ‚Äòvegetarian‚Äô, in quotes because the menu is full of fake meat dishes, fake burgers, fake chicken and basically bad American food. No naturally meat free dishes, no mushroom ‚Ä¶"
5,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice place! The waiters are friendly and the beer + food is tasty. They didn't have all beers in the menu and it was a little crowded (probably on the edge of covid rules) so that's one star less. I'd recommend and go again.
6,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I love this little place but the food is way too expensive. 15 euro for a veg burger on a plate and nothing else. No fries, salad. A shame. They could just be a bit more generous. If you got to Pacific Parc it's cheaper and you get fries."
7,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Very good beer. Food was okay, had a decent size and a slightly special flavour. Service was nor fast nor slow. We were satisfied. I recommend this place for the beers."
8,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Very large choice of beers, nice atmosphere, and tasty food. Yet you better reserve before coming as it can often get overwhelmed."
9,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely Brewery. They have their own selection of beers, including a gluten free one. The staff was friendly, nice atmosphere and great terrace."
10,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you're looking to give your teeth a break from chewing, look no further. The spare ribs at this place are so fall-off-the-bone soft that you'll only need your gums to to eat this meat. I barely got to taste the food since I inhaled everything, but I'm sure it was delicious and worth coming to again if I'm ever back in Amsterdam."
11,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The place is a stylish brewery in the middle of lovely Westerpark- I often come there with friends. They have their own beer and obviously a selection of other drinks. However, the food is rather disappointing. I had pizza, which is priced ‚Ä¶"
12,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome beers, nice burgers an the traditional dutch snacks, what else would I want? The service is great and the staff is very frindly. Don't miss the opportunity of indulging yourself."
13,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,a week ago,One of my favorite go-to burger place in Amsterdam. I like their burger-beer recommendations.
14,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good atmosphere would definitely recommend for groups. The bar food is also not bad. Service is great when ordering from servers when using the app service is a little slow.
15,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice ambient with very good burgers and special beer.
16,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love the atmosphere, their own brewed beer (honingblond, the best one) and I actually really enjoyed the vegan burger they have together with the sweet potatoe fries :)"
17,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It‚Äôs the best hamburger I‚Äôve ever had in Amsterdam ! I had the classic burger, accompanied with sweet potato fries. It was just excellent. The waitress was very nice, who explained to us patiently their speciality. And the outside terrace was perfect for a sunshine day. In short, five stars !"
18,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,4 months ago,It was interesting to see restaurants inside a church.  For someone who hates beer it was actually decent but the food was not good.  Not one of us enjoyed it.  Go for the beer but not the food.
19,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Went there and ordered a burger. Although their menu is almost entirely vegetarian/vegan, we asked if at least the burger contains meat to which the waitress replied that they could add real meat to it.
Then.. We got served a soya burger.. Bummer"
20,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A nice craft beer brewery in the beautiful settings of the Westergasfabrik, not as widely known as other Amsterdam breweries, but because of the quality of the different types of beer, the variety, and the cool pub they will be, imho.
Staff was nice, too."
21,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best brewery in town. Great beer food especially flammkuchen with spinach and feta. Try awarded New England IPA if you like a fresh and fruity taste. Pilsner and IPA is also very tasty. If you wanna come with a group you should reserve in advance. Strongly recommended!
22,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Vegan and veggie Burgers were nice, a bit dry tho and the bread was not that fresh. Beside that the place and the staff are great, good vibe a very friendly!"
23,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It was the Best veggie burger I ever had 2 years ago, but when I went back recently I was hugely disappointed. Burger was bland, and was quite expensive for what you get."
24,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely loved this place.

They do quite a big range of beers and a lot of them were great - New England ‚Ä¶"
25,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice place to have a drink or snack. Service is a bit slow especially on a busy sunny day. ‚Ä¶
26,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Burgers are really good, fries are delicious. You can even buy some of their beers to take home !"
27,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Home brewed beers, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Enjoy the friendly atmosphere and cool down on a hot summer day. Don't forget to rate the beers on Untappd!"
28,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"4 stars for food, quite good, moderate. The beer they make is worth attention, but there is planty of space for improvements, but live music... well, it's all you need for five stars"
29,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I've watched a waitress walk down this passage twice, looking right at me and ignoring me. It's been 25 minutes since they've dropped off the food. I've gone to the bar to order a drink and it's been 15 minutes and still nothing. I definitely won't be returning here"
30,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good food, excellent beer (according to my friends)."
31,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This brewery and venue is lovely. Spacious, great beer, and live jazz on wednesdays. Still haven't tried the food but it all looks great. Will be back!"
32,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love, love, love this brewery. We visited each time we were in Amsterdam, and loved each time!"
33,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This busy spot in the center of Westerpark consistently serves the best ribs, and best burgers in Amsterdam. Not a secret: their meats are quality so the flavours of their pork and beef hold up to their assertive, thoughtful sauces."
34,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Dissapointed by my last visit. When my burger arrived I noticed there was mold on it. The staff replaced it but still charged me the full price (14 euros for a burger, without fries). I'd have found a little gesture price wise appropriate ‚Ä¶"
35,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beyond Meat Burger üçî is supper yummy. Pair it with their IPA and the New England. 5/5
36,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Good beer, good food. Really nice place."
37,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Nice mood inside - all this brewing stuff in postindustrial localisation makes an impression. Outside is also ok. Wit beer was really nice.
38,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Beer is great, stuff is very friendly the place itself is quite cosy."
39,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and beer. Service was friendly but not particularly fast, still very much worth a visit though."
40,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great atmosphere, tasty burger, amazing craft beers and live music! All you need for a fantastic evening in great company."
41,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great spot for some beers with friends! Atmosphere is nice and service was quick! Will definitely be back.
42,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,a month ago,What's better than to enjoy a brew at its brewery? ‚úåüèΩ
43,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice place with a good terrace outside. Food looked good, not tried it. Great self produced beers!"
44,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice vegan options on the menu, very friendly staff and cool exotic beers.
Looking forward to visit them again :)"
45,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great atmosphere and good service. Perfect for larger groups.
46,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place for a beer. Or I would recommend the Italian Burguer they make here! Superb delicious! The meat is very tasty with the sauce they add. There is a large space inside, so if you don't have a seat in the outside, have a try inside."
47,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice experience at the Troost with homemade beers (honey blond and wit beer üëåüèº). We took the Fish&Chips and Umami burger : last one delicious with Asian flavors ! ‚Ä¶
48,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely one of my favourite places. Great selection of their own home brewed beers. Good food, they used to concentrate on these fantastic burgers, but more and more other dishes are made now as well. Friendly staff! It's pin only, and on busy nights reservations in advance are recommended."
49,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great bears, good burgers, trendy and busy. Get a table early on Friday nights and be patient with the servers as they often have their work cut out for them with the volume of patrons passing through. My advice is to get a pitcher of beer as the line at the bar gets hectic and long."
50,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Delicious vegan burger and cake, mua! And very friendly staff"
51,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Troost beers are great! I love also their plant based burger, so yummy."
52,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"One of my favorite spots in Westerpark! Great beers, lovely atmosphere, good food"
53,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Good burger, great beer, speedy service. The terrace is a great place to sit on a warm day."
54,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great beer of course, food is also great and consistent across the various locations (definitely recommend the burgers). I would say one thing to look at is the service, my experience is that whilst it is always friendly it just tends to be quite slow and you can be waiting for a beer a while in between."
55,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A wide collection of beers & nice atmosphere, tip: order their italian burger, that is really tasty ;)"
56,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great place for informal meetings and for big groups. Their beer is great and they have nice food
57,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The beers are very good as is the food. The feel and vibe are very laid back. The service is very bad but this is common in all of Amsterdam. Don't be afraid to go find your server to ask them for something as they won't stop by your table. This advice is for all restaurants and bars throughout the city.
58,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to grab a beer and lunch.

Food is tasty, prices are OK. A bit on the high side. ‚Ä¶"
59,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice setting and nice people serving drinks and food. You can even pay with a ""tikkie""! However the price for the hamburger was 15‚Ç¨ without any topping or fries. Those were an additional 4‚Ç¨. So a bit expensive. Drinks on average 3.5‚Ç¨."
60,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place to eat and have a beer!
5 Stars for tasty food (with a vegan burger option and vegetarian options) and indoor  and plenty of outdoor seating. If in the park its generally a good place ‚Ä¶"
61,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,a year ago,Terrible service. Went for dinner (burguers) and the waiters did not inform about the kitchen closing time.  When we wanted to order the burguers the kitchen had just closed and they didn't let us.  They were simply not interested in taking ‚Ä¶
62,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great friendly atmosphere in this bar. Great beer selection, some of which are very strong with unique blends! They do great food too, we had the Classic Burger and Fish and Chips which were super tasty!"
63,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good bar, for sure to be crowded if the weather is pleasant! Inside a cozy setting, good fast service with plenty of options to eat while you taste their beer. I only had the pilsner (hot afternoon), good nachos (order them!)"
64,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice bar with a good amount of outdoor space. Perfect for large groups. Food menu looks great and bar snack like spring rolls available late night. This bar is card only no cash. Not a problem but just worth noting.
65,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brewery, with a wide selection of beer types. Their burgers are amazing, one of my favorite places in town to get one, and they make fries properly. A thing that a lot of places around Amsterdam seem to have forgotten."
66,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great craft beer with. My favourites were the OPA and English pale ale. I can recommend the taster with 4 of their best brews. I also tried the IPA which was good, but Ozzie wins this round."
67,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place. Great selection of beer. But the best was the service. Amy, Shutruk and the guy with the tattoos. They were amazing. So helpful and happy to serve us. Give them a raise! They are gems!!"
68,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great place to have a nice craft beer! Lots of different kinds of beers and a great vibe!
69,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This was the best burger I had in Amsterdam. I'm usually very cautious with this kind of judgment, but they truly deserve it. ‚Ä¶"
70,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent place to visit when you're in Amsterdam.  The crowd, the beer, food are excellent..definitely will come back before I go back to America."
71,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We went to eat there with a group of friends. A lot of the things on the menu were not available. It took them really long to get us our food. We had done for deinks each before the food arrived. When it arrived, it didn't. The plates came ‚Ä¶"
72,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We had a good time at Troost. The place has a really lively atmosphere. After dinner a live band started playing some cool jazz music. Unfortunately this made it quite hard to have a conversation at the table, but still we were pleasantly ‚Ä¶"
73,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice cosy place, the food is nice, the beer varieties are endless and great. The vibe in general is nice, however don't except any service here, was considering giving it a 3* for service; It was slow, they weren't nice and not service minded whatsoever, however this seems to me the theme I'm Amsterdam."
74,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food and drinks, but overall a bit chaotic. We've been here many times and it happened too often that we got the wrong bill (then we had to go back the next day to claim our money back..) and that our order took way too long, even on ‚Ä¶"
75,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Total chaos, not enough staff, mediocre food (many things unavailable) and slightly overpriced. Beers were okay."
76,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok so I really liked the alignment of colors of the men's bathroom. The beer was decent ngl, super hot waitresses and waiters, definitely one of their biggest selling points, really makes up for the expensive beers. Much love xx. Take care"
77,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beer beer bier, or IPAs ... that's what makes this place a charming attractive spot apart from which the food is tad on the expensive side of the wallet. Food is not bad either but rather the burgers are good size so it generally will fill you up."
78,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Decent place, and their lager is tasty. There are two do-it-yourself taps that can be reserved in specific time slots. ‚Ä¶"
79,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good beer and cozy place with a lot of people from everywhere
80,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy place with great atmosphere. I was impressed with how cheerful and polite the staff is. Food is ok but I find it overpriced, e.g. will never order again 2 tacos for 15 euro. Just go for a classic burger for the same price."
81,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great choice of beer and food. I went there several times and both ribs, burgers, and fish and chips were great. Downside: service. On a busy Friday night they can easily forget your order"
82,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice and lively brewery with a good selection of beers and food options. I visited two of the brunches the Westergas and one in De Peij, which is a former monastery. They produce their own beer , liquor and lemonade; its location has its ‚Ä¶"
83,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice brewery bar inside the Tuinpark Nut en Genoegen. It has an industrial architectural flare which gives it a funky & cozy ambiance. If you're lucky you can hear live jazz music while drinking one of their beers. Price are OK, not cheap.  Expect it to be very crowded after 6 or 7pm."
84,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent beer venue with great table service. Interesting building and lots of shiney brew kit. No cash payments, card only! Tried a few beers but the IPA was super fresh & tasty. Will be back :)"
85,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Wonderful specialty beers, amazing burgers and ribs. Always loaded with people and occasional live jazz music. Great for an evening with friends, business outing or 1 on 1 drinks and chats."
86,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good drinks and if they play good music, its a good place to hang. Spacious for bigger crowds. Kitchen often closes timely so no food later at night."
87,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Troost brews their own beer so it doesn't get any fresher! Combine that with their amazing selection of burgers and you've got the perfect night out. Good vibes at sunny terrace too.
88,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Decent beer, decent atmosphere, cool location. A bit loud, so hard to converse if you are there with friends. The service is a bit slow, but it's still nice to stop in for a local brew. The more seasonal and traditional stuff tastes the best!"
89,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A quite wonderful place with a beautifully wide range of beer. There was just everything you would want, and it was all great. AND they had Uno. Imagine that. The food looked incredibly tempting but we didn't try it. Fabulous."
90,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Didn't eat, only drank. Lovely place. Clean, inviting. Music is too loud but that's ok because there is outside seating. ‚Ä¶"
91,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is good but service is soooooo slooooow. We were served at completely different time. Wine is average. No ""beyond meat"" burger past 21:00 on a Saturday night. Really disappointing."
92,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice beer and great food.
93,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great venue - lots of interesting beers, good food, friendly staff and a relaxed vibe. We were a group visiting Amsterdam for a birthday, and we went here for dinner and drinks - we arrived without a booking on a Saturday around 8pm, had a ‚Ä¶"
94,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best bars in Westerpark, unique and fresh beers, good food, plentiful outside and inside space with last sun falling on the edge of the terrace, there is no music; this is more of a social food and beers place but well worth the visit!"
95,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The veges tacco was a bit dry. However the cheese burger and sweet potatoes fries were really good.
Good diversity of biers available.
Friendly staff."
96,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Half of the menu was not available, nachos and burger bun were burnt and the spare ribs tasteless.
Pull your socks up guys! Used to be a place I liked but I actually want to eat ‚Ä¶"
97,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,There are multiple 'troost brouwerijen' in Amsterdam. I like this place because the burgers are very tasty here and the waiters friendly. I gave this place 4 instead of 5 stars because I'm a beer lover and Knower and thus kind of spoiled. ‚Ä¶
98,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great beers and huge burgers in a beautifully renovated former factory. Make a reservation for dinner, but you can also have beers at the bar. Outdoor seating and carry-out bottles also available."
99,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Popped over on a Sunday afternoon and the market outside was in full swing. To escape the wind I took refuge in here. Great, quick service, a great selection of beers, the Saison was great but the lager tasted empty after (which you might ‚Ä¶"
100,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Beer was good, kinda odd service, you only could order at the bar and they stop doing tasters after a certain time, but this place was slammed when I got here.  They sell some snack food to go with your beer but it's hectic to find seating and generally people just stand outside and drink and chat"
101,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent bier, tasty dishes. The frame of this former gas factory is very original and (somehow) free of turists. highly advised!"
102,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice beer, and good food, burgers are awesome."
103,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Many types of beers, good burgers (plus they serve beyond meat) and also great location! Cool to see the beer silos inside the place."
104,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good beers, nice vareity. The service is really bad though. 3 attempts to get the border right. Waiting for first food serving for 2 hours. Still things went wrong with the order (incomplete, with ingredients in, when was promised without,etc).drinks were got wrong too. Jammer."
105,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great beers brewed on the premises, friendly staff and excellent budget food. Two of us left tipsy and stuffed and the bill was only ‚Ç¨45!  Other similar venues could learn a lot from Brouwerij Troost!"
106,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Everything about it was excellent!  beer, service, food & venue!
The waiter recommended the Italian burger, I was skeptical but I went with his recommendation. It's one of the best burgers I've ever eaten!! Will be back soon!!"
107,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Neighborhood brewery with quite some fresh brews and barfood. Favorite hangout spot for locals around the Westerpark area. ‚Ä¶
108,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This whole star goes to the great craft beers. Service was pathetic especially if you are of colour, we had to ask to be served and thereafter could not order anything else. During payment the seem-to be-manager walked away because he did not want serve us."
109,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Been here a few times before and always enjoyed it, until last week... It was quite busy due to unforeseen nice weather, so we didn't really mind waiting quite long for our drinks. The fact that 2 sate's took 45 mins to deliver was ‚Ä¶"

113,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good burger. Shame that the fries on the side were priced extra. Good beers and normal service. Service was however very cheerful.

121,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place, great beers, recommend especially the IPA. Good food, fish and chips was excellent at ‚Ç¨17. Great surroundings in Westerpark. Thoroughly recommended."

123,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was good here, so was the beer, all with normal prices for Amsterdam tourist areas. The atmosphere is great although service is a bit disoriented but helpful and friendly."
124,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great pub food, solid locally brewed beer. For the real craft beer drinker it'll offer a good couple of beers but they don't offer any guest breweries."
125,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good place to meet with friends for drinks and/or dinner. Cozy up inside or relax on the terrace. A big variety of beers and amazing gluten free and vegan hamburgers.
126,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, good food and drinks and the staff was excellent.
Downside is i found the food quite expensive, and things like chips and salads had to be bought separately."
127,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Love this place. Very good beer selection. Food is also very good and service kind. The whole Westerpark area is full of nice places but this is absolutely my favorite.
128,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,2 years ago,Waiters were too busy flirting instead of servicing people who wanted to order. Even after nodding that they saw us they didn't show up. Left after 15 minutes
129,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We were refused to take our food with us as the kitchen was 'busy'. Needless to say how idiotic it sounds? You serve food n I take it with me-No extra work required from u. Service is usual Dutch, which means awful!"

131,Brouwerij Troost Westergas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's your good old brewery type place in Amsterdam. It was a bit cold and the service a bit slow. Other than that, it's ok. There are other options in the area that I would probably go to if I'm around there."
