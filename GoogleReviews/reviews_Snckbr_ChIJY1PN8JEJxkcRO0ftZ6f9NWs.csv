0,Snckbr, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had a vegan surprise menu, by far the best vegan food I've had in a restaurant in ages. The chocolate cake we had for dessert was out of this world!! Definitely worth the money and will be going back."
1,Snckbr, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The food was great but not as outstanding as I expected it. The service unfortunately was one of the worst and therefore I would not recommend this place. If I make a reservation I expect a nice table instead of being squeezed in between …
2,Snckbr, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food!

The place itself is amazing, looks like what I wish my house would look like... …"
3,Snckbr, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food was excellent. They have lots of vegetarian options but also really good meat which is odd - catering to both groups. Really creative menu. But two things: it's not cheap and the service is slow.
4,Snckbr, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Entered drunk and hungry. Was initially disappointed by the menu listing not-fried-fries and light mayonnaise, but ended up having one of the best burgers I ever had with great not-fried-fries and delicious light-mayonnaise. Service was very fast and friendly and helpful. Will return."
5,Snckbr, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Went there with a group of 10, made a reservation which was good because it was crowded. 6 of us, including me, ordered the chefs platter which is ment to be shared with two people. However when it came it was barely enough for one person, …"
6,Snckbr, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food in a nice setting. The music is unstable, sort to say. Seemed like the employees were playing around with a Spotify list. But other than that, nice place, good location, good food :)"
7,Snckbr, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great burger and perfect sauce ! Marvellous !😀
8,Snckbr, 1 star ,3 years ago,The food was just blend (there was not a grain of salt in the whole dish) and terribly overpriced for the mediocre quality. …
9,Snckbr, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Usual below average service and above avg prices.

10 minute wait for a €5.5 pre made smoothie.  Oh here's the pancake menu. Oh no …"
10,Snckbr, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Wanted more from the space and the service. But had a great drinks menu.
11,Snckbr, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Lots of food and courteous service but dry chicken and other items so and so, sounds much better on the menu than it tastes. No toilet paper on either toilet, would maybe have given three stars otherwise."

51,Snckbr, 1 star ,4 years ago,Poor food poor service disappointing
52,Snckbr, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Extremely healthy tasting food. You can eat a ton, and still feel clean, guilt-free and holy. Very conservative with their seasonings, in favour of brining out the natural flavours of ingredients - which sometimes work brilliantly and sometimes just bland. Smoothies: rabbit-like. Octopussy: great, delicate, full of meaty juiciness."
