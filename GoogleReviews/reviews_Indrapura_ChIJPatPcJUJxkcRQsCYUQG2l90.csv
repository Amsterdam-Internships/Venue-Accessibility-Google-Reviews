0,Indrapura, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Under new management, but just as good.   I have visited on at least one trip each year to the Netherlands for over 10 years and have always loved their food.  I have taken family and colleagues; everyone loves this place."
1,Indrapura, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really tasty Indonesian food. Must try the iga bakar domba and the soto ayam which were both delicious and hearty. The mains are served with a portion of rice and also come with two side salads (gado-gado and a mango salad) as well as fried …
2,Indrapura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing! Had a traditional rice table here with a friend and have to say every single thing served was just delicious. One of the nicest meals I've ever had. The flavours and offerings were completely different to anything I've tried. Really good value for money and the staff were lovely. Cannot recommend enough!
3,Indrapura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great Indonesian dining experience

Relatively expansive"

5,Indrapura, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We experiences the worse welcoming at Indrapure.

When we arrived at the door, a long older grey haired owner/waiter walked …"
6,Indrapura, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We snuck into this place off Rembrandt Square on a whim, as we’d heard that one should have Indonesian food while in Amsterdam. As early eaters (between 5pm and 8pm, though I’d check on the door first), we were valid for the 25% discount on …"
7,Indrapura, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited Indrapura for the 3rd time recently, and each time we have enjoyed the food thoroughly. I would prefer to visit around 6.30, since i) the place is not that busy and ii) you get a discount of nearly 30% on rijstaffel. Even though I am vegeterian they have decent options in rijstaffels."
8,Indrapura, 4 stars ,a year ago,We had a feast here and must have tried almost everything on the menu. All very flavor full. Clean restaurant and excellent service
9,Indrapura, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice restaurant with a gourgeous view, if you get a table by the window.
The food was unexpectedly tasty, we had the lamb options, and the extras they bring with the main course are quite savory and generous, offering a variety of tastes."

13,Indrapura, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"This is not fine dining, it is a ok buffet at best. Staff , however is great! Very pleasant and friendly."
14,Indrapura, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and wonderful service. Be sure to go with a group to get the sharing dishes - I recommend the lobster one, delicious."
15,Indrapura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful restaurant! Very friendly and welcoming staff - they even have a piano player! Have been multiple times,  food is always absolutely delicious - we usually go for one of the rijstafels, and I think every dish over the last 3 or 4 visits has been great."

21,Indrapura, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Rice table is really good but service was slow
22,Indrapura, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly service, pretty pricey with dishes starting over 20 euros. Good rice table with many items ranging from spicey to mild. We got the lamb rice table for me and my girlfriend and had a hard time finishing all the food. Would recommend stopping for the rice table but I would try somewhere new before going back here."
23,Indrapura, 1 star ,4 years ago,Very poor services. We made reservation in advance. The person who welcomed us is not welcoming and only great us at the entrance without directing us to our table. Left us clueless. Our table wasn't set up for us. …
24,Indrapura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Everything. And once again I'll type it... EVERYTHING  they served was outstanding. The lamb itself was worth the price of the entire dinner, but one beautifully plated dish after another (tapas style) made for a perfect, PERFECT meal. …"
25,Indrapura, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Low quality food. The wonton had raw fillings and had to be recooked.
26,Indrapura, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Below average Indonesian restaurant - rice table offering was disappointing : no spice, no kick, but lots of bland vegetables. Restaurant was big, airy and lacked atmosphere. Staff were very friendly, but let down by the food."
27,Indrapura, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredibly good food! We had such an amazing dinner here. What a unique experience, ordering the rice table. Would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Amsterdam. Is better with more people (4+) so you can all share the food. The only …"
28,Indrapura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely Indonesian restaurant serving great food with millions of condiments. You order a main dish of any meat or seafood and it comes with rice and other small plates like salad, aubergines, potatoes etc. One main is pretty filling for two …"
29,Indrapura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First of i would like to take a moment and say from the bottom of my heart that is one of the best restaurants I've ever been,the flavours are out of this world and personally i was in heaven for a few moments! Although am allergic to …"
30,Indrapura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is the best advice I can give anyone going here to sample Indonesian food - get the RICE TABLE!  Its a flavor sensation party for your mouth.  Try so many thing in one order, well worth the money and if we are ever back in Amsterdam this will be on the must do list.  Well done Indrapura xo"
31,Indrapura, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Came here with four people. We tried to look up a menu online first but there doesn’t appear to be one. We were shocked upon arrival at the prices - around €25 for a main. We ordered wines, three entrees and two mains. A guy came up and …"

33,Indrapura, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was amazing but the manager did not treat us like other customers are we were young guests (aged 23--26). Compared to older adults where he showed them to their own table, took their orders and jackets etc. GREAT food though!"

37,Indrapura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing Indonesian food, great atmosphere, warm/kind service. Don't discount it because its in the touristy section of Rembrandtplein - it was one of the best meals I've ever had in Amsterdam. Get the Indrapura rijstafel!"
38,Indrapura, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I have never left a negative review in my life and I do realize that this is not a Fine dining  restaurant, but dear me, I also think that you can expect some sort of standard when you go out to eat. …"
39,Indrapura, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We booked a reservation for 17 people, they forced us to split into two tables (one for 8 and the other for 9 people). They also forced us to get a fixed menu for 31€/person (drinks not included) as we were a ""big group"". We decided to go away."
40,Indrapura, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Indrapura is a wonderful place with a great atmosphere.The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was quite tasty & well cooked (I've had indonesian food in Bali and this is actually better). I loved the lobster and the lamb chops, …"

45,Indrapura, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I come often at this restaurant, all the food is very delicious my favorite food in this restaurant is the Medan spiced lobster it tastes so amazing.  the place is also very pleasant"
46,Indrapura, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"Very arrogant manager asked us to leave if we didn't order 2 main courses, he said they are the most expensive Indonesian restaurant and they need to pay rent, so if we didn't order what they want us to order we had to leave.  Very arrogant attitude, poor people's skills. Don't go there, don't support their arrogance."
47,Indrapura, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was ok, nothing to write home about though.  Charged for items we did not receive from a set menu and when this was pointed out, the manager blamed me for not mentioning it earlier. Charged full price despite not receiving at least 3 of the protein dishes. Not impressed."
48,Indrapura, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely amazing food, Special prawns were really great. Only issue was food is served bit late, I guess cooking requires time. Really peaceful place to enjoy your food."

51,Indrapura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Never having eaten an Indonesian meal before perhaps we are not the best judges but in my opinion as long as you embrace spicy this was excellent.
52,Indrapura, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Considering this place is right smack in the middle of the popular Rembrandt square, I was expecting the usual terrible tourist-esque restaurant treatment. Nothing could however be further from the truth. This place is absolutely terrific! …"
53,Indrapura, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Mid century modern decor. INDONESIAN rice table ""rijsttafel"". Restaurant of exceptional quality.  The peanut sause is sweetly delicious.   Proportions are generous,  food is delightful and the price is a nice break from the Amsterdam usual."
54,Indrapura, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, very tasty. Very good service."
55,Indrapura, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The Indonesian food here was very good. I had lunch here and would totally do it again if I was in the neighborhood, better than the surrounding restaurants and the food seemed like it was home-made and fresh."
56,Indrapura, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"If you haven't had Indonesian food before, you'll probably enjoy the food here. If you have, there are much better Indonesian places in Amsterdam. The staff aren't friendly from our experience."
