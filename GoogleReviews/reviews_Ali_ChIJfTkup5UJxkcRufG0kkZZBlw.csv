0,Ali, 5 stars ,3 months ago,We have dinner at Ali Ocakbasi every time we visit Amsterdam. The food and service is always outstanding. Our server Konstantinos is outstanding. I Highly recommend you ask for him to be your server. He provided us an outstanding experience with  is service and personality. Inside the restaurant is very clean with great views outside.
1,Ali, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"I really liked this place, all different mezes that I tried were delicious and freshly made, kebab was great and dessert rich with pistachio."
2,Ali, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I went here with my boyfriend and parents 2 years ago. First time experience was amazing. I think I never have been so impressed by a restaurant at first. This year my boyfriend and I went here to have a nice birthday dinner. Again, this ‚Ä¶"
3,Ali, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Tasty restaurant! I really enjoyed eating Turkish food sitting next to the canals. I ordered the meat with yogurt and eggplant mix which was excellent!!! It is pretty pricy but I assume it is average for Amsterdam. Worth the price! I‚Äôll go again.
4,Ali, 1 star ,8 months ago,"The food was not cooked well, like it is raw food also the gave us a wrong invoice when we asked for it. Check the photo between the wrong invoice with the one I prepared there is a deference of 40 EUR. ‚Ä¶"
5,Ali, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,"The food is quite average compared with other (good) Turkish restaurants in Amsterdam, while the service is terrible and the options are quite overpriced. I won't say it is a bad restaurant, but definitely there are far better places in Amsterdam for dine in."
6,Ali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place it's a must for Turkish food lovers. I felt like I was in Istanbul. They have a variety of food, mezze, shashlik, delicious bread, real Turkish coffee, chai, rakisi, and pistachio desserts. I loved the Turkish pizza with the most ‚Ä¶"
7,Ali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We ate here in June 2020. Great food, pide was the winner. Ispanaki Pide with added cheese was the favorite all around. Semsek mini pide with goat cheese was the favorite starter. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. Will definitely be back."
8,Ali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"After a stopping at a few restaurants with issues, we found this place and so happy we did. I have been on a Turkish good kick and this place hit the spot. Cute inside there is a second floor that has nice seats along the windows. Good ‚Ä¶"
9,Ali, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Great tasting fresh food and the service is great - the owner is in the restaurant hosting his guests. The mezze platter experience alone could be a meal but don't skip on the grilled meats ( the one with pistachios and the veal are both really good!!)
10,Ali, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Rated 1 out 5 because i couldn‚Äôt rate 0 ! Was sort of rude from the beginning, and by the end they were refusing that we pay using credit card though it is written on the front door that they accept Visa ! The owner tried to force us to pay ‚Ä¶"
11,Ali, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Good and fast service & very delicious food!
12,Ali, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent food - authentic Turkish dishes. The sides and bites are amazing. Mains are good but a bit overpriced. Really large portions - go here hungry.
13,Ali, 1 star ,4 months ago,"The Resturant doesn‚Äôt accept international health passes, although it was acceptable to all other restaurants and facilities during our 2 weeks trip. If you are an international tourist, I recommend not wasting your time going there."
14,Ali, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Perfect, perfect, perfect! Go and try Turkish kebap. Even better than Turkey!"
15,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ali‚Äôs Turkish (or more precisely - Anatolian) restaurant on the Herengracht serves delicious dishes, the tenderest meat from the barbeque. A great feature is the big display of fresh cold starters from which you can pick your favourites. Cold Turkish beer very tasty as well. Service pleasant and attentive."
16,Ali, 1 star ,4 months ago,Last night my son and 2 friends went to eat in Ali asking for a table for 3 and they were kicked out in a very rude way saying that they do not have place. They might have been full which is understandable but the attitude was very ‚Ä¶
17,Ali, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Such a bad experience i left the place without even eating. The reason is the bad behavior of one of the waiters, (the long hair one with ponny tail). I can tell you the food also doesnt look good so i decided to leave without eating. You ‚Ä¶"
18,Ali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It is Turkish restaurant,I had eaten dinner with my family and enjoyed it very much. Vegetarian and non vegetarian options are available.it is little bit pricey. Vegetarian food with dessert for 4 person cost us around 70 euro. It is different , one should try."
19,Ali, 3 stars ,9 months ago,I heard about here from one of my Turkish friends and he suggested this place and we gave it a try. ‚Ä¶
20,Ali, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a cozy place that offers common Turkish food. The food was board presented and tasty, but relatively on the pricy side. The meal in my pictures was 35‚Ç¨. The service was mediocre and the kitchen was fast."
21,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good Turkish food, would highly recommend especially the ≈ûa≈ülƒ±k meal (venison) which is hard to find on the menu in other Turkish restaurants. Service was also very good, highly recommend."
22,Ali, 1 star ,2 months ago,One of the worst kebaps I have ever eaten. Let the (high) price and good looks of the restaurant not fool you.
23,Ali, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Atmosphere of the restaurant is nice, interior, decoration etc.
Food was very fatty but portion size was good."
24,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We ordered the chef's recommendation from the grill. The meat was juicy, tender, well seasoned, flavourful; simply perfect. Be aware that they will charge you with the appetizer that they present on their big plate. You will get a turkish ‚Ä¶"
25,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic restaurant üëç the food is delicious and very nice, people here are friendly and it's clean , I love it"
26,Ali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I came here to eat with my turkish boyfriend. It was amazing! We never had turkish bbq that good!!! The meat was so tender and delicious. Absolute must eat if you are looking for a good bbq.
27,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"You better save some room in your belly if you come here. Absolutely delicious Turkish food, many nice meze (starters) to choose from, and I just cannot leave without having a dessert and always eat too much. One of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam, so much love for this place!"
28,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,AWESOME FOOD AND STAFF! We stumbled upon this spot and they did not disappoint. Cool seating overlooking a canal. Fast service.
29,Ali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I saw a sponsored ad on Instagram by this restaurant, and the ad looked so good, that I felt my mouth water and we got to this place 3 days later.
We ordered 2 appetizers (feta cheese and the eggplant in yogurt), and as the ‚Ä¶"

All staff are kind and professional."

36,Ali, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"It was ok, the mezzes need to be seasoned better."
37,Ali, 1 star ,8 months ago,"We came to Amsterdam for just one day and I wanted to eat a kunefe, they through us out because we just wanted desert. I don‚Äôt recommend this place and they have a bad customer service. they looked at us in a bad way before asking us to leave, order from the manager."
38,Ali, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, but I‚Äôve never seen a restaurant charging for the water that comes with raki anywhere in the world. At least ask, so I could opt for a salgam instead (what‚Äôs worse is the Turkish speaking female waitress didn‚Äôt even care for this mistake). Sorry to see such a nice restaurant failing in such small things."
39,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super good food with awesome service. Awesome music and cosy environment. One of Amsterdams best Turkish restaurants.
40,Ali, 5 stars ,a year ago,Had a great meal here last week. I had the beef and my girlfriend had the lamb (cant remember the dish names exactly). The price is on the expensive side however the quality of food made it worth it. Presentation of the food was also of a very high quality and staff were attentive.
41,Ali, 1 star ,a year ago,"As a family from Turkey we were very excited to visit this place. After opening the menu and being shocked by the incredibly high prices (the Google budget indication should change from $$ to $$$), and seeing the small portions on the table ‚Ä¶"
42,Ali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I have been to this place several times. This is the Amsterdam branch of a famous restaurant chain called Ali Ocakbasi. They have 3 more restaurants (2 in Istanbul and 1 in London). It is not like everything they serve is perfect  but it is ‚Ä¶
43,Ali, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great tasting food, good atmosphere, a tad pricey"
44,Ali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I came on Friday the servise was 100% perfect but when I came the day after and I got a reservation but I was little upset about the service and delay of preparing the food although I have ordered only desserts and t√ºrk kahve..
45,Ali, 2 stars ,3 years ago,They had only one option for chicken which I ordered and it was not nice. It had too much fat on it which I couldnt eat. And it is way toooo over priced. The Humous and bread were very nice but that is about it
46,Ali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Incredible good food, nice flavors, both the salties and the sweets. I recommend, the staff is very good and helpful."
47,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very delicious turkish specialty halal food though quite expensive. I had a meal from the ""from the grill"" selection. My meal was a Ali spicy kofte."
48,Ali, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Amazing flavours. First we started with some Kuru Cacik and a dish with beans, all acompanied with Raki. For the main course we ordered a Isplanaki Pide, Ali and Saslik. The dessert consisted of Katmer and Turkish Coffee! Everything was amazing!"

51,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice location with a really good selection of interesting food. Enjoyable.
52,Ali, 3 stars ,a year ago,Good kebab but average Turkish pide. Atmosphere is also below average. We had (kind of trouble) finding a proper table even if we had a reservation. Thanks to Konstantin (our five star waiter) we found a good table and had an excellent service.
53,Ali, 1 star ,a year ago,"I'd give this place a 2 if at least food was authentic and good.
But here is the summary of my experience:
- bad service ; they let us start eating the starters and only then they told us ‚Ä¶"
54,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious, and the service very neat. Hope to come back as soon as possible. Thanks a lot."
55,Ali, 1 star ,5 months ago,Really bad service completely unfriendly and unprofessional. Food wasn‚Äôt food and very overpriced
56,Ali, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Firstly, we didn‚Äôt like the fact that waiters offer you starters like if they were for free. They come to your table with a big plate asking if you want one. Each plate is 7‚Ç¨ :P they came to our table twice and were surprised we didn‚Äôt take ‚Ä¶"
57,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It is my second time in Netherlands, can‚Äôt pass this place without visiting this marvelous restaurant. I strongly advise Amsterdam visitors to have lunch or dinner and enjoy the delicious food."

65,Ali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Me and my family (Malaysian), tried this restaurant during our visit to Amsterdam in summer of 2018. So my review might be a bit obsolete. But, we tried the best beef saslik (still the best) we've ever tasted in our lives, in this very ‚Ä¶"

67,Ali, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent Turkish food and the service was amazing.
68,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food was very delicious and the whole evening was fun. Got to taste lots of different Turkish foods and beer. The restaurant offers a very cozy atmosphere and the service is very pleasant. Will definitely come back when I'm in Amsterdam again.
69,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,This place has decent food but something that eclipses your whole experience is how the manager dude abusively treats the serving staff. We had second-hand nightmares/embarrassment based on how he was talking *at* them. I usually don‚Äôt care ‚Ä¶
70,Ali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty Turkish cuisine, yet overpriced."
71,Ali, 1 star ,a year ago,"The place was good . The owner  was so friendly .But the food compared to the quality is very expensive and the quantity of food in the plates, compared to the price, is very low.  Please pay attention to this matter. Sorry  I will never come back ."
72,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food in this restaurant is amazing. In warmer days you can sit by the bar like counters by the windows and watch the beautiful canal and the Amsterdam crowd. Not only the food is amazing, the whole ambience is something that puts this place high up in the list of the places they want to revisit."
73,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I've been here every time I've been in Amsterdam over the past few years and they can't be beat. The quality has remained top notch. I always get three Chef's choice and have loved every bite.

75,Ali, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great food, nice place and good service, which is very hard to get here in Amsterdam"
76,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,Think twice bedore you prefer to go there. I can not talk about the food quality since I left the place due to the quality of service. The story is that: ‚ÄúWe arrived and asked for a table in the upstairs. The guy asked: ‚ÄúHow many people are ‚Ä¶
77,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cool Turkish cuisine demonstration in Amsterdam. I like the taste of the meal provided there. The restaurant has good interior design too. The staff is very friendly.

79,Ali, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Re visited the place after a year. Still amazing.
80,Ali, 1 star ,3 years ago,Not sure if the reviews reflect the reality of the place. I‚Äôve had Turkish food before. This is not worth the over priced dishes. Stale bread. Soggy salad. And average food peppered with a depressing atmosphere was our lunch experience here unfortunately.
81,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good location, nice atmosphere, tasty & delicious food üëå"
82,Ali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good Quality, nice and very friendly staffs."
83,Ali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty quality food with friendly service  and renomated among Turkish people as well. Unfortunately overpriced even for Amsterdam. 15 euro for a pide or 24 for one skrew of lamb is ridiculous. Again, quality and service is good but..."
84,Ali, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I‚Äôve never ever been to a Turkish restaurant without being offered tea at the end of the meal! Plus every single table around us were offered tea and we chatted for half hour after our meal before finally asking for the bill and leaving! Very offensive, cannot recommend."
85,Ali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It was just amazing, i have been in turkey 2 times, and when i went to Ali Ocakbasi, it was like i have been in turkey again, and it's not just the quality of the food (you must take a kenafa) also the service was at high level, i recommand for sur."

87,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Everything was just delicious...the dinner made me so happy!
88,Ali, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Even though the food was really good (especially the desserts) we were shocked by the unreasonably high prices. For example 1ltr of water was 6 euros, meat plates (small portions) around 25euros, raki 10 euros the glass. Everything really delicious but..! Also the service not really impressive.."
89,Ali, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Kebab was nice, atmosphere was nice. The service was a bit bad, one of the guys insisted on giving us the Muhamara he was carrying for a while, and when we asked him to replace it with fresh one cause it's dry he wasn't really supportive ‚Ä¶"
90,Ali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Exellent restaurant, the new manager mr.

The food was delicious many thanks to the Master Chief!?!!"

92,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food indeed tonight. 3 starters, 2 mains 3 beers and some water 69  euros. It's, Amsterdam. What do you expect? Excellent lamb and chicken kebabs. Deffo go again. {not quite, as good as Duende Dos tapas though. That was epic}"

94,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I am very disappointed, very bad hospitalty!!! The whole floor was empty and the owner didn‚Äôt let us to sit where we wanted. He wanted us to change the seat twice! We were 2 people and wanted to sit beside the window to see the view but we ‚Ä¶"
95,Ali, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is nice, food not so much especially for the price. Portions are extremely small, though the meat was cooked great it was not so tasty, pide was too salty and halva didn't have any hint of butter. Overall very dissappointing."

97,Ali, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great spot, service and food!"
98,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredible food, great canal-side location. I had a few appetizers, an entree, dessert, and Turkish coffee - all were excellent. My favorite meal in Amsterdam."
99,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I made reservation for me and 2 friends, they had trouble in the restaurant with reservation system so they didn‚Äôt expect us. After we got our table we waited long time for someone to come. After we gave our orders we waited 1 hour for just some chicken and kebab. I am very disappointed and people never forget this: My name is Jim."
100,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,Yesterday evening I ordered Katmer as a desert at Ali Ocak ba≈üƒ± and with the first bite my girlfriend found stone like objects in the desert and the shell of the pistachios. We told the waiter of which we think he might be the owner of the ‚Ä¶
101,Ali, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is ok but the service depends on the waitress you engage with. We were placed next to a very loud and crowded Turkish group. There were many available tables but we were turned down when asked for replacement. They are unfortunately falling to the trap of ""we are already popular""."
102,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Our first time visit was better than expected:-)...the starters (Meze) were surprisingly tasty...the lamb & veal meat stick had been perfect tender...also the bread goes nice with all...service was timely & staff quite friendly...guess we come back soon :-)
103,Ali, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I have read it was the 2nd best place in town for a kebab. It was such a shock when we saw this 2 ridiculous lukewarm pieces of 'wrap' (?) with boring fries. The lamb was quite good, but even my girlfriend who doesn't eat a lot was starving after our lunch, which cost 31‚Ç¨ incl. 2 ayran drinks."
104,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best food in amsterdam!   I loved my meal here. It was reasonably priced and delicious.   Three of us are and drank like kings for 95 euros.
105,Ali, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Someone who has eats regularly in Turkish restaurants won‚Äòt be satisfied. The service is well but there are few choices and the menu is overpriced.
I do not recommend this restaurant to someone who wants to eat good Turkish food and won‚Äòt visit it again."
106,Ali, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great Turkish food (kebab). It's a proper restaurant comparing to more old-fashioned Turkish places in the city. Service is good, prices are reasonable. Been there already 2 times and plan to visit again."
107,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,"ABSOLUTLY BAD SERVICE, to expensive to be a restaurant and for that ""quality"" of food. Cola and fanta etc. drinks 80% water, turkish food are much better than what they serve. They bring delicates to the table that u have not ordered and ‚Ä¶"
108,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing Turkish food, it a must for any traveler"
109,Ali, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Very limited choice for vegan menu unfortunately .. surprised to see that also hummus that is nomally vegan by definition contains milk :( Warm bread is good and service is fine too
110,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"So Amsterdam is very multicultural and diverse. You have a lot of Turkish restaurants especially outside the city centre that are quite good. I also live in Amsterdam and this restaurant has very quality food and something that other Turkish restaurants don't have, namely Katmer. It's a desert! Give it a try!"
111,Ali, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Very good quality of Turkish food, a rare place you can find in Amsterdam"

114,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not bad,could be better"
115,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful food and service. Some of the tastiest Turkish Kebab we‚Äôve ever tasted. A visit to Amsterdam is not complete if you like Kebabs and haven‚Äôt visited this outlet.
116,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Good quality food but definitely over priced!! Staff is not friendly and arrogant.
I would rather look for better options around."
117,Ali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food , Bad service"
118,Ali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, good dine in arrangement. Food was also nice and super tasty as well. I only felt that the staff was not very helpful. The lady serving us was really cold and seemed not interested."
119,Ali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food is good - over average. Nice location with friendly staff. But the prices - especially for meze - are very high compared to the size of the portion.
120,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible service tonight (and not the first time). Small portions and overpriced. After visiting a few times, we definitely won't be back. Such a shame since the food is pretty good."
121,Ali, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It was okay up until we had to pay. We asked for the bill, but after we didn't get it we went to pay at the bar. However no one was able to help us we had to wait forever at the bar for the manager to come and help us as he was apparently the only one who could help us."
122,Ali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing halal Turkish food ,amazing place and atmosphere üëç"

125,Ali, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Their bread is great, the eggpland puree is nice and the Ali Nazik was tasty with non-chewy fresh ground meat. The service was friendly and professional. I'll visit them again."
126,Ali, 1 star ,5 months ago,I had an appointment for a Job interview for washing dishes and they canceled as soon as they looked at me. Probably because I was not Arabic they didn‚Äôt even let me in the door after one commuted an hour to get there. I will give 1 star because I‚Äôm very disappointed in the unprofessional attitude they gave me :(
127,Ali, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Reserved a table upstairs ,but upstairs was closed, also the Turkish thee was normal thee quite disappointing, the food was perfect though loved it and worth it to visit , desert was amazing, food makes you full"
128,Ali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Turkish food is great even better than most places in Turkey. Portions are more than enough, start with cig kofte and finish with kunefe :) . Only down side is it is expensive"

136,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food. Service was a bit slow to start, but otherwise a great place. Definitely try the shashlik!"
137,Ali, 1 star ,4 years ago,"When the waiter a more interested by flirting with you than to take your order, there is already a problem. Then 13euros for mini durum and 5 french fries, it's robbery."
138,Ali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I tried turkish food for the first time here and it was amazing!   Coming back for sure!!
5 stars deserved!!     Greetings to the staff!"
139,Ali, 1 star ,3 months ago,food is very bad taste
140,Ali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The minced lamb had to be the best I've ever tasted!!!
141,Ali, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The food was great and the service was good. They even accept American Express as payment method. Never had such delicious Turkish delights before.
142,Ali, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Pretty good Turkish place, do try some of the dips that they have for starters‚Äîthey'll make fresh Turkish bread for you to enjoy with them. Prices are reasonable for the area."
143,Ali, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food what you get is very little to what you pay. And I think the price -quality-amount is not in line. The price is much too high. I will for sure not ever go again , and the Manager is unfriendly terrible guy, do not work there if u cant handle it !! Bad very bad manager !!"
144,Ali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A pleasant place to enjoy Turkish food.  Pleasant service and tables by the window give a great view .  Can be a bit noisy  but  that adds to the atmosphere
145,Ali, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Try the turnip soup. You love it or hate it. Good decor. Go upstairs for a good view. Try the raw meat balls. Sounds weird but tastes delicious
