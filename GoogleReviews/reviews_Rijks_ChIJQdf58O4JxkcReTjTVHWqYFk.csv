0,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice restaurant with a cozy interior and friendly staff. With two days advanced notice, they created an excellent five-course vegan menu. Will probably dine here again next time I'm in Amsterdam."
1,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"My favorite restaurant !
If I could give it 6 stars I would!
Aside from amazing food, the ambience is delightful, the wine pairing has to be experienced to be believed. It’s perfect for a special occasion."
2,Rijks, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Good location, perfect service and great food and wine. It's a little pricey and some of the portions could be a little bigger for that price, but most of the tastes are spot on. As you can see from the pictures, the dishes are gorgeous. We replicated the beetroot mille-feuille at home and it was as delicious."
3,Rijks, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Went for the guests chef evening Rijks x Bros'.
Truly nice experience overall, getting the best of both Rijks and Bros'. Being Italians we had extremely high expectations on Bros' dishes, especially on the …"
4,Rijks, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious.  We had the 6 course meal.  Each dish was well explained and very tasty.  The cocktails also went down a treat.
It does take about 3 hours to complete all 6 courses, but it's 100% worth the time."
5,Rijks, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"A fantastic place, a wonderful restaurant, kind staff and outstanding food with attention to details. I give it 5 stars. And the silverware is located in a drawer at your table, a fancy idea (see photo)"
6,Rijks, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"This was hands-down the best dinner I’ve ever had. Tried the 5-course vegetarian dinner and it was incredible. The beet with foam was out of this world. The staff was fantastic, too. I’ll definitely go back!"
7,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The most important and most beautiful museum of the Netherlans with a lot of paintings, with a huge 17th century collection, but also ship models and a lot of different object terughoudend history. And now as extra a stunning exhebition with Renaissance art, mostly beautifullg detailed portrets."
8,Rijks, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Wonderful experience, had the 5 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. Nice waiting staff, fantastic dishes, good drinks. Very good value for money"
9,Rijks, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Quite an amazing restaurant. Rijks staff members know what they're serving and in general quite friendly. The atmosphere and dishes used were all on point. The tasting menu was superb and left you at a perfectly content level (not too full, …"
10,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I don’t know much about art and certainly not a museum person. But i liked the whole setup. It is famous and crowded for obvious reasons. You can rent a cycle and ride around. There are some shops and cafe here to make sure you can spent as long as you like. Easily covered by walking once you get down from hop on hop off bus.
11,Rijks, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The Best Restaurant in Amsterdam to have a real good fine dining experience
12,Rijks, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great flavours and excellent service. Reasonable prices
13,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Great restaurant with a nice interior and very attentive staff. The food was really good (especially the rice pudding with pistachios and blue cheese). However, removing one star since I bit on a piece of crabshell left in one of the dishes and didn't get any sort of apology from the staff. That should not happen in such restaurants."
14,Rijks, 2 stars ,2 years ago,First time I’m disappointed after having dinner in a 1* Michelin restaurant. Service was good and wine as well however food was not up to the expectations. Portions were small considering limited number of plays and combination was not …
15,Rijks, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"We ordered a four course meal through Thuisuiteten. It arrived in a timely manner. Overall it was a pleasant experience, however the amuse , and the dish with tomato and mozzarella were really not special. I really enjoyed hollandse …"
16,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect Lunch menu
Everything is done in 1.5 hrs which is pretty good time for a Michelin star restaurant in Europe. …"
17,Rijks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really enjoyed the dining experience here, which is really as beautiful as it is tasty. The entire menu is creative and playful, and every dish is complex in its preparation and flavor profile. The beet root was amazing and the ceviche and …"
18,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant is right next to the Rijksmuseum. The outdoor area is surrounded by a flowered wall. Absolutely relaxing to dine there on a summer day.
I had a some oysters and a three course menu. The wine recommended was quiet …"
19,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Was a nice place, stayed to be a nice place. Good attending staff, nice menu for reasonable prices. Dishes are well taken care of, good and tasty combinations. A la carte dishes are a little smaller than in between dishes what's good so you …"
20,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved the stylish interior, most of all the drawer for cutlery in every table (see photo). Staff is friendly and helpful, for example with choosing a glass of wine from the extensive wine list. …"
21,Rijks, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Wasn't impressed. Expected a lot more for €70pp. The dishes were made of fresh ingredients, which was nice, but nothing really stood in terms of flavor or value. For example there was the appetizer that had scallops and pumpkin slices - the …"
22,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A beautiful, atmospheric restaurant with contemporary decor next to the Rijksmuseum. The food is excellent with some surprising twists and combinations of ingredients - though in some cases, a bit too experimental for my taste. Service is …"
23,Rijks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Quite good restaurant with nice decor, spacious eating space. All dishes were good, but they made a mistake to my cod dish, instead of giving me cod in coconut foam, they gave me grey mullet (which was the fish I had as ceviche in my …"
24,Rijks, 2 stars ,3 months ago,So disappointing. Expected great things but was not impressed by any of the flavours from each dish.
25,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice place with kind service and amazing dishes. Lunch menu is not expensive but tasty and leaves you completely satisfied. Only thing I didn't like so much is that the whole restaurant is a bit noisy. This makes hard to have comfortable conversation.
26,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very upscale restaurant in nice location. Had 200g of the 4 week rib eye, and the aged farm duck platter. Ribeye was flavourful and came with lots of crispy fries, and farm duck platter was really interesting and umami! Even the starter bread was delicious- dense and crispy bread with a light whipped butter."
27,Rijks, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is rather creative, but why is there so much salt. Punch in a face amount of salt. One has to concentrate to be able to go through this salt to be able to get the taste. …"
28,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was EXCELLENT especially notable was the beef cheeks...INCREDIBLE!

The service was very good. The ladies serving us were friendly, nice, and took …"
29,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really great vegan full discovery menu with #rijksxvillanos event. The start was messy as they made us come earlier than we had requested only to wait in line for hanging our coats and then wait again at the bar as table wasn't ready... …
30,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best meals I’ve had in a long, long time. Each dish was creative enough to be exciting but familiar enough that it wasn’t intimidating. The sommelier paired the meal with excellent Dutch wine (that I only wish I could get in the …"
31,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good lunch orchestrated by Joris and his team.
Traditional service style and innovative dishes. We've travelled throughout Dutch colonial past with exotic dishes. Provence Rosé wine was great pairing. Not exactly seasonal and local but worth a visit if you hangout around the Museum district."
32,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We went to Amsterdam to celebrate my birthday together with my boyfriend.

A dinner at the restaurant was a part of a birthday present. …"
33,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious. We had the 6 courses tasting menu and we had some nice surprises. The association of different flavors along with the wine pairing they suggested was great. We were pretty full by the end of it. The service was great as well. I will definitively go again if I ever come back to Amsterdam!
34,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,All round great experience. Food was elegantly presented and beautifully paired with some lovely wines. The service was efficient and attentive. The ambiance needs a little work in my opinion.
35,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The most enjoyable LUNCH for the year! Staffs are so knowledgable about food ingredients and wine paring, and incredibly attentive. The cost is remarkbly much less than other Michelin Star restaurant - 37.5 pp for lunch e.g.-  Food is …"
36,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is fantastic!
Service is a bit of an issue. It’s not clear who’s giving service to our table, and it’s difficult to get the attention of any waiter. …"
37,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Service was great - everyone was attentive and they took the time to explain. Food was really really good. Cabbage was my favorite. I love the fact that we could have starters as our main so we got to try many things. Ambience was lovely. I could spend an afternoon there without a problem. Thank you the Rijks!
38,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Insanely good food. Amazing service and a great atmosphere. I didn’t need a reservation and simply walked in for lunch. Best restaurant in Amsterdam.
39,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best Michelin star restaurant where we been. Perfect super tasty magic food. Hight level service! Recommend to visit on lunch time! Cool deals!
40,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice restaurant, almost to the standards of a Michelin restaurant! But I would only recommend this restaurant for special occasions only since the dishes are a little pricey. Enjoy your meal!"
41,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Elegant dining next to the museum. Each dish we tried was excellent and the staff was very attentive and welcoming.
42,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A good restaurant to experience if you're in the area. We went for lunch, and ordered ribeye steak and the two course duck. Both were as good as expected from a restaurant with Rijks' reputation. …"
43,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Their Michelin star is well-deserved.  A memorable dining experience.  Highly recommend.
44,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Rijks had dishes that throughly impressed me, as well as some that were very forgettable. The ""mille feuille"" beets was a clever take on beets that tasted amazing. It is hard to make vegetables mouthwatering, but that's what happens when I …"
45,Rijks, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Outstanding menu, try the beetroot (I thought I did not like beetroot). They have a selection of Dutch wines and the one they recommended was surprisingly good. Best restaurant experience in Amsterdam."
46,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We enjoyed the guest lunch by Nerua, the restaurant of Guggenheim in Bilbao. Great cultural experience of food and wines."
47,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It is so stylish and modern restaurant. 4 weeks aged beef steak is tender and tasty.
Excellent night view of Rijksmuseam,too."
48,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely love this place. The menu it’s amazing. The atmosphere is great and the service is exceptional.
49,Rijks, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Being based in the the Rijksmuseum, RIJKS is expected to be quite artistic and it does indeed live up to that idea. The entry area, waiting spaces, and main dining room feel both modern and old-school in their luxury, and the chef's table …"
50,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Chef's Counter with limited seats tasted plenty of live feeling and hospitable at the amaizing time.
51,Rijks, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Went to Rijks to eat out for the first time in more than 6 months. The food is amazing and the staff charming and knowledgeable as well.
The 6 course tasting menu is diverse and wine pairing works beautifully with the …"
52,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wonderful food and experience. Very authentic Dutch ingredients presented in a unique and creative way.
53,Rijks, 5 stars ,a year ago,"High end restaurant, that lives up to expectations.  Great menu options,  interesting,  non obvious wine pairings.  Both chef and sommelier are bold and original. Service is impeccable,  seating with enough privacy and nice view, mostly of the rijksmuseum palace. Interesting and tasty evening.  Worth a try for sure!"
54,Rijks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Service was perfect. Waitresses are helpful and friendly. Each course you get the pleasure of different taste and all of them was perfectly balanced.
55,Rijks, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice food, very fresh! Dishes looks pretty. quiet busy at lunch on weekends."
56,Rijks, 3 stars ,a year ago,I didn't like the taste of the main courses from the 6 course dinner during last visit. Deserts were fantastic with the exception of the yogurt with fruit jam inside. All main courses did not leave any remarkable feelings and didn't ignite …
57,Rijks, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had the chef's table for a birthday dinner. Everything was to the expectation - food, wine, service, cheerful atmosphere! Every single dish offered exceptional taste, often out of ordinary ingredients. The only dish in the menu that we …"
58,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Visited 3 times. Good food and services.
59,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing service. Great food.  Perfect after a nice tour of the museum
60,Rijks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,One of those places that needs to be on your list when visiting Amsterdam. As a museum it's right up there with the big ones in the world. Allround history of Holland and our heritage in world history.
61,Rijks, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Good food, but overrated."
62,Rijks, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of the best restaurants in the area. High setting for business meetings.
63,Rijks, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My friends and I are three Chinese traveling together hoping to taste contemporary Dutch food from Rijks after reading many reviews. However, we had a very disappointing experience here. The food was ok, we weren’t expertise in the Dutch …"
64,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I inadvertently entered this restaurant because I was hungry and alone, without knowing that it had just received the Michelin star, and... I totally loved it!! The ambience is elegant and cool, but modern and smart casual, without the …"
65,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We were at the Chef’s table. The food served was all delicious, well balanced. In fact the portions seemed substantial for a tasting menu. The service was average. Courteous, with a smile, but with a European efficiency. That’s to say …"
66,Rijks, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The museum is beyond phenomenal. All the art pieces have a lot of history. The exhibits and the different floors are very well organized by time period. …
67,Rijks, 5 stars ,7 months ago,We just visited the exhibition about our history of slavery. Very impressive and beautifully put together. I highly recommend seeing this.
68,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fine dining with a friendly atmosphere. Had a set menu.
69,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a large museum with a varied and impressive collection. We splashed out for the one-hour guided tour and have no regrets. Arnold took us through the Rembrandt exhibit (usually a separate admission but the tour took us through as …
70,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Rijks was perfect from beginning to end.
The host was incredibly hospitable, he got us to our seats quickly. The service was good, the meal was incredible. You can tell the individuals cooking really have a passion for what they do, and it’s beautifully done."
71,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I went here together with my pregnant wife for our anniversary. The staff was very friendly and helpful, they showed great knowledge about the menu. They offered excellent delicious alternatives for the things my wife can't eat. The dishes …"
72,Rijks, 1 star ,2 years ago,Ate there last night if you can call it that...and was a total disappointment. Had a 9:00 reservation and waited for an hour for our first cocktail and 2 of us out of 6 still did not get ours. The price fix was no longer available after …
73,Rijks, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, wine and experience.  Food quality didn’t match the prices.   Steak was cold.  Nothing really stood out in terms of taste or flavor.    My group left disappointed with the food but enjoyed the experience.  Won’t return as better food at similar rated/priced restaurants."
74,Rijks, 4 stars ,a year ago,"My wife and I dined on a Monday in May 2018 at ""RIJKS®"" (gourmet restaurant). Of the restaurants we had shortlisted before our visit to Amsterdam, this was probably the only one that was open on Monday evenings. Not least for this reason we …"
75,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.  Service was phenomenal. We chose for one of us to order prix-fixe lunch and the other to order a la carte so we could sample more dishes. Server was very kind and accommodating. Excellent Dutch wine to …
76,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,World class food. Needs to work a bit on wine pairings (imho)
77,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely looking restaurant, and although guests were rather tightly packed together, we have a terrific time.  Very friendly and helpful service, no issues with my baby, and most importantly of all, all courses of our meal were amazing. …"
78,Rijks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food, friendly staff
Central located in Amsterdam. …"
79,Rijks, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I almost never give one star reviews, but the service we experienced was amongst the worst we have received (and we didn’t even get a chance to try the food!). We had an excellent experience at the Rijksmuseum this morning, so we thought we …"
80,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing atmosphere and the food is beyond incredible!!!
81,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely afternoon on the terrace. Modern, nicely executed small plates with well balanced and interesting flavour combinations. Some of the nicest food I've had in The Netherlands. Service was efficient and friendly whilst being relaxed …"
82,Rijks, 1 star ,a year ago,They use the name and location to give you tiny portions of food. The forel was half or a quarter filet with some cucumber on top and drenched in sauce. Pretty bland dish and older waiters were cold Dutch type of people with low interest.
83,Rijks, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice location. Sophisticated food... Good interior.... But personnel is absolutely not ready to have big groups served.... we appeared to have lunch at the moment when Chinese group had their lunch as well.. first - our dish choice was …
84,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I think it is the best museum in Netherlands!
85,Rijks, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Top! Very likely the best restaurant in Amsterdam.
86,Rijks, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very innovative and very tasty. Service is kind
But: wine list can be improved by a lot. I get the concept but it's not awesome. Food also (slow service because many tables) can go into a more to the point …"
87,Rijks, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Let me start of by saying that the staff is very friendly and service oriented. The interior is very stylish and the location excellent. The food is original and good, although I wouldn’t call it exceptional. The two stars are because the …"
88,Rijks, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately just one star for a 1-star Michelin.

My family was here last week to celebrate a birthday. We arrived around 745pm …"
89,Rijks, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Lovely place with very well trained staff. Warm and welcoming. Food was pretty good ...perhaps my rib eye steak  could have been more tender but I the sweetbreads made it for it. I found very interesting the contrast between the very modern decor with quite relaxed waitress uniforms.
90,Rijks, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice experimental kitchen and interesting drink menu. Portions are quite small and the combination of different tastes/textures is not always optimal. The menu should differentiate between starters and mains. The service was ok but I …
91,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Sublime food and great service at reasonable prices. Simple and modern decor and a great bar. I will definitely return.
92,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Service, food, ambiance, everything was great. Highly recommend the six course menu as it was phenomenal."
93,Rijks, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious cuisine, tasty dishes, modern atmosphere, trendy place to rest after your museum visit. Little downside: the quality of staff cannot cope with the price-level. A couple of “no-go’s” in service left a little bitter note."
94,Rijks, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Best thing about this place is location. I can’t say the same about view, atmosphere, service or food. Rijks supposed to have a Michelin star, but that’s probably a mistake, at least the food is rather average. Price for the menu is fair, …"
95,Rijks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Menu was refreshingly light (and vegetarian friendly without sacrificing taste) but lacked standout dishes. Service was great and the wine pairings were perfectly complementary.
96,Rijks, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"In a beautiful and spacious place, the RIJKS serves both a tasty and elegant menu. My friends and I did appreciate the relaxed yet courteous service. We went to see the chef to thank him for our meals. Nice and approachable personality. We will definitely come back."
97,Rijks, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I went several times at Rijks Restaurant. Food quality is interesting, but this time hosting has been not good at all. I sent a reservation email this morning. I had no reply, and I passed at 13.00. The boy at the reception said that was …"
98,Rijks, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant at Rijks Museum is very popular and is known for their one Michelin star rating. Upon entering the restaurant, it had a very nice setting and and had an ambient feel. Once we were seated, we were immediately given a menu, and …"
99,Rijks, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful restaurant, unfortunately that was the extent of our positive experience at the Rijks. We went on Christmas so I can understand why the restaurant was overwhelmed and seemed disorganized. The food was nothing out of the ordinary. …"
100,Rijks, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Seems like a nice place from the reviews, which is why we decide to have lunch here with the family. But was disappointed. Service was lax to put it mildly. Food very average. For a place like Amsterdam, with such a varied and fantastic food scene on every street, this was was truly a let down."
101,Rijks, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This is a destination restaurant well suited for a fine dining experience.  Good for special occasions, like birthdays, anniversaries.  The service is of high quality, very attentive.  And the food is of equally high quality and presented …"
102,Rijks, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is quite nice, very comfy seating. Service was poor however, I am not one of the typical demographic for this type of fine dining and was made to feel very aware of it the whole night. Service was …"
103,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, prices over the average, but in line with the quality and service. 2 entrees, 1 main, 1 dessert and quality bottle @ 100 eur/ea. Will do again."
104,Rijks, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of the best fine dining restaurants in Amsterdam. Every dish had a great combination of flavours and the staff are very attentive. All their wines are Dutch or Dutch owned which is a nice touch.
105,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I can't recommend this place highly enough. The service is absolutely outstanding and the food is superb - the imagination of the chef knows no bounds. …
106,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This restaurant, based on Dutch produce, is improving over time becoming one of the best addresses for good food in Amsterdam. Dishes are very creative appealing to the eyes and to the mouth. They combine different ingredients playing well …"
107,Rijks, 1 star ,4 years ago,Wow what a disappointment.  Aspires to and almost hits Michelin star for food quality---nice presentation but feature entree ribeye was tough and duck overseasoned with fennel.  Service sinks the place.  Clearly saving money on wait and …
108,Rijks, 3 stars ,3 years ago,This is review based only on the experience at the bar with coctails - the coctails menu is very gin-biased and ultimately they seem to have the same taste only in different glasses and with different ornaments. Also the bar is a bit bare …
109,Rijks, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Ok, but less than expected for a Michelin starred restaurant, mostly because of the table setting (school cafeteria style), average food taste, and small portions. We took 6 dishes, a dessert and wine: amongst them (I cannot recall them …"
110,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice food
111,Rijks, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I got seated soon enough, but was plonked on a table in front of a massive delft piece, meaning I couldn't see a thing or had any space.
It took an absolute age for them to come and take my order. …"
112,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Three times I had croissant in three different places in Amsterdam and they were all very good, better than good. Coffee was always top notch too. The Netherlands understand the nuance of a simple meal and they bring it to another level. …"
113,Rijks, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We had our Christmas dinner at Rijks. Very lovely atmosphere and delicious menu, accompanied by very tasty cocktails. A bit on a pricey side but it's worth it."
114,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love the Rijksmuseum!  I am very proud when I see the Rembrandt and Vermeer paintings.
It was the first visit for me since the restoration of the building, and it …"
115,Rijks, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It is fun and a majestic museum. After the great renovation and the new way of presenting the exhibits it falls significantly short of greatness. Once you explored the world famous and world class Rembrands, Vermeers and their ilk the rest …"
116,Rijks, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Food was nice! Very overpriced! Also they charged for no show! Ridiculous! Organising a a corporate dinner with half of the tables empty, they still charged a ridiculous amount! There are much nicer, posh and trendy restaurants in Amsterdam, I would not bother going there again! Will never recommend. Avoid if possible!!!"
117,Rijks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We went to Rijks for lunch last week. The food was very tasty and the wines were matching the food very well. Friendly staff and nice location.
118,Rijks, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We've had a chance to eat at some 1 & 2 star restaurants in paris. As we were having lunch, we remarked that it seemed equivalent to at least a star. When we were paying our check, the hostess mentioned they had just received a star the week before. Great location, great food and for now a 1 star that you can just stroll in and eat!"
119,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Rembrandt's collection is just amazing.
120,Rijks, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The waiter didn't check our dishes with us and then gave us the wrong dish. After our explanation, he still believed that we had ordered that dish, refusing to take it back. It was really a bad experience."
121,Rijks, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious food from a great menu selection. Alas, I found the place noisy and the service sometimes rushed."
122,Rijks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food and service.
123,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent restaurant with excellent dishes and very good service. We stopped here for lunch and ordered their lunch menu. The dishes were very good and the service was pretty fast.
124,Rijks, 1 star ,2 years ago,They were racist and would not sit me because i was wearing a hoddie and not their type of client.
125,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had the tasting menu for dinner and it was one of the most incredible food experiences I have had. Everything was absolutely delicious and the sauces were out of this world amazing!
126,Rijks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great restaurant. We had an amazing lunch, every dish was perfect. Yes it has its price, but the experience worth it. I recommend !"
127,Rijks, 5 stars ,a year ago,Beautiful terrace with amazingly prepared dishes and excellent wines. All topped by outstanding service. Big thanks to Max!
128,Rijks, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Don’t get the star rating. Food ok and wine fine but nothing special. Service poor and hasty. Tables too close. There are far better restaurants in amsterdam in this range.
129,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's not a regular Michelin star restaurant. much more casual, and the price is friendlier than you would expect. A must before a long tour in the museum."
130,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent. Very nice restaurant. Liked their menu very much. Very flexible in combining different courses. A must go if you are around.
131,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous food in the shadow of the Rijksmuseum. We were here in summer when all the tables were outside in the sunshine, can't wait to go back again when the weather gets nice again!"
132,Rijks, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This was my favorite Amsterdam restaurant bar none. The technique, ingredients and flavors were delightful. The service was brisk but excellent (for Europe)."
133,Rijks, 5 stars ,a year ago,Tried their vegetarian dishes and was not disappointed at all.  Great wine pairings too.
134,Rijks, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The service was very poor , the waiter forgot what we ordered and brought us something else, all the evening waiter asked us only twice if we want something it was i. Beging and in the end. The atmosphere like in workers eating room to …"
135,Rijks, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good wine, but the food doesn’t match with the price and the quality. Not satisfied and still hungry when leaving this place"
136,Rijks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Staff was very friendly and managed to squeeze me in despite being fully booked for lunch. The food was very good and on point. A very pleasant experience.
137,Rijks, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Just one star does not seem to be right... I am sure they will earn there second very fast. The diner was magical and the whole experience was really great.
138,Rijks, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible Dutch service, it's as if the staff have no understanding of hospitality. The woman at the door is particularly vile! Embarrassing really. The food is just about average."
139,Rijks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Was an amazing experience. When you eat there you have to get the wine pairing with it it was really really good.
