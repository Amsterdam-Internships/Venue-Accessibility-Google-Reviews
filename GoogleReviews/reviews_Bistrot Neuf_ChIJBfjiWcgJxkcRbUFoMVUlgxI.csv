48,Bistrot Neuf, 1 star ,2 years ago,Deceptive billing and overcharging!!! This would have been a great review but alas we were duped. A table of 4 chose formula  menu of 36.5 euro for 3 courses. However what was presented on the bill was an itemized billing of our selections …

50,Bistrot Neuf, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stopped for a quick snack here but didn't realize then we would order 1.5 lobster with two very nice cooled glasses if wine. Can't wait to go back. In hindsight the Michelen stickers on the doors should've have been a give away for the quality here.

52,Bistrot Neuf, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I ordered through Uber eats. There was a problem with the order and they fixed it immediately. Excellent customer experience (unlike the support of Uber Eats). The food was absolutely delicious, probably the best that you can order at home! Merci beaucoup !"

54,Bistrot Neuf, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst experience ever for a Michelin-star restaurant. Except the lobsters, other dishes are not worth it. We had trusted in the reviews and the Michelin star but we found out that the restaurant was far under the standard. The service was …"

61,Bistrot Neuf, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great French restaurant in a cozy area in Amsterdam. This place has a great menu, I can highly recommend the Côte de Boeuf. However, it's the wine collection that is really the greatest attraction of this place. The wine list is long, …"
62,Bistrot Neuf, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Something has happened to this restaurant. Started out with great food and service. I have been over 5 times. However the last 2 times have been terrible. Service was arrogant and dismissive. Food was very average. Fix it or you will lose it. You are only as good as your worst night.
63,Bistrot Neuf, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a nice and cosy place with limited but quite exciting menu. Ordered the coquilles saint jacques, which were very nice and the côte de boeuf prepared medium. But it was more on the rare almost raw side. Such a pity. Meat quality could be better too for that price... it was a bit tasteless.  Nice wine list although also pricey."
64,Bistrot Neuf, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We got the escargot appetizer, and the coque au vin and fish entrees. Everything was superb!!! The ambiance is quiet, cosy, and private. And they have Michelin stars if you need any proof of the quality of meal you will receive. We definitely recommend to anyone in Amsterdam."
65,Bistrot Neuf, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Amsterdam. It's become a tradition for my wife and I to have our first meal here every time we visit. We start with the oysters, always fresh and refreshing. If we're here for lunch, one of …"

68,Bistrot Neuf, 1 star ,a year ago,Found several 2inches long pieces of raw meat in the tartare. We mentioned it to the waiter who changed it. It came back the same!! Not a word of apology.
