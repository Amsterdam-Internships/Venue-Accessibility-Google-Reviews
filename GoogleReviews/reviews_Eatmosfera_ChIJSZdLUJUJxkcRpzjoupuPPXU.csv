0,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The place has super good pizza we ordered delivery from them in the past, it's a nice atmosphere, but my tagliatelle weren‚Äôt the best ones this time, not enough sauce and taste. My friend's dishes were delicious as they told me. I loved the ‚Ä¶"
1,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very friendly staff, easy to call and make a reservation, nice house wine and delicious pizzas!"
2,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Based on a friend's recommendation on pizzas. The staff service was welcoming with explaining the menu and gave us some nice recommendations. ‚Ä¶
3,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First of all we got a table without reservations at a couple of hours. Excellent red wine, great dinner. The staff is very polite, enthusiastic, willing to help. Great Italian restaurant in Amsterdam.  For recommendation!"
4,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Food was quite nice, good quality and well prepared. However, location, atmosphere, and chefs hygiene detracted from experience. I have only positive things to say about the food, but everything else left me just wanting to leave. Somewhat expensive for the level of service."
5,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This place serves authentic italian food. They always have a special menu on the side which is quite interesting. So we ordered both dishes from that menu. It didnt dissapoint us, its well seasoned and if they have Tiramisu on the menu definitely try that one out because its a winner for sure!"
6,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very Good pizza! It is very well prepared, quality ingredients and very well cooked. Good selection of artisanal beers, and great dessert. It is better to reserve because can be quite busy. Authentic Italian owners, very friendly. In general very good, even the desserts. Very nice the children pizzas!"
7,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An authentic italian place in the middle of the most touristy area. Amazing staff and pizza was delicious! They make it with sourdough. The starter with all sorts of sausages and meat was really good, too. Real italian wines. A little expensive but they have to keep their spot on Rembrandtplein."
8,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very busy and loud restaurant. To go, its better to go early or just book a table. Friendly staff and everyone is italian. Pizza is much more on an Italian style here. Risotto is also ok."
9,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best pasta and pizza I've tried in Amsterdam so far! Also their desserts are HEAVEN üñ§ I f you want to come during the weekend be sure to make a reservation!
10,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,An absolutely delicious meal with ambiance to match. An Italian haven hidden on a small Amsterdam alleyway. Try to make a reservation in advance - tables fill up quickly! But entirely worth the wait. ‚Ä¶
11,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was of relatively mediocre quality, steaks were good though!
We were 12 at the table and nothing came at the same time... After starters we waited 2 hours almost to get our mains and no one got served simultaneously here ‚Ä¶"
12,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazingly tasty pizza, the best dough you can find in Amsterdam, super friendly people. So far it is my best pizza experience in Amsterdam!
Thank you, Giuseppe and company! We were on a walk and the guys have offered us ‚Ä¶"
13,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing super fresh food. I had shrimp risotto, which was very light n tasty. And my friend's Calzone was great, with super fresh rikotta. Wine was lovely.  Waiters and chef very friendly and cute, heard Chef singing, good voice ;)  i liked the place and the simple italian vibe üòç"
14,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"OK food, not friendly or accomodating.
The pizza was rather good (although I've had better. Personal preference, really). ‚Ä¶"
15,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food experience! Even though the service was a bit slow with small mistakes, I am giving 5 stars because the food was really tasty. The restaurant is cozy with friendly staff and affordable prices."
16,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Good pizza, ravioli was lovely but very very small portion not filling at all. Saw frenkie de jong there but he ignored me"
17,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cute Italian joint in the heart of Amsterdam.  Lovely and fresh food.  Fresh ingredients.  Presentation needs work and pasta was a little over cooked. Butter sage sauce on the ravioli was too emulsified for me rather than just keeping than ‚Ä¶
18,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great pasta, good wine and nice bread. This restaurant is a small but warm place to have a special dinner."
19,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty Italian food, though a little pricey. Big problem was the mosquito infestation in the restaurant, people were leaving because of this and kids got lots of bites - hope they can sort it out. The beef carpaccio starter was very good, ‚Ä¶"
20,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, everybody loved what they ordered. Super nice staff with good recommendations. The tiramisu was the best I've ever tried. Highly recommend this place!"
21,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This place was highly recommended by my quite critical italian friends. Once you get over the terrible name, and the fact that it looks like a tourist trap... this place does deliver! The food was very good. A little pricy but thats mainly because of the area. Will come back"
22,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food and great service. Was completely booked and we had a big group so it was rather slow but Drinks were quick though. Definitely one of the best in Amsterdam.
23,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. Pizzas were 8/10. Tiramisu was perfect.
24,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was such a great experience to dine here twice (because I was so impressed) while in Amsterdam. The level of service by the staff, and quality of the food server is amazing! üëç, and consistent even through a variety of the dishes my wife and I had. Thank you Samuele for such a great experience!."
25,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Fantastic pizza, later we also ordered tagliatelle - equally delicious. ü§å"
26,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very nice and cozy place, the quality of foods is very good and the staff is very kind and professional!"
27,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff. Enjoyed the seafood pasta and seafood soup. The carpaccio was yummy too.
28,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We had high expectations of Eatmosfera, because of the good reviews. It was good but not exceptional. Most of all we were troubled by the hustle and bustle in the restaurant. It was restless. And the interior was not as comfortable as the ‚Ä¶"
29,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very delicious traditional Italian food experience. Homemade pasta was like heaven üòã Coming back soon again. Big thanks to the team & Samuel
30,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,5 years ago,So many countries and cities and this is the best italian restaurant I had outside Italy. Just follow the daily specials. The linguine cozze was amazing. The tiramisu was the best in my life and I had so many tiramisu. Burrata and pizza are a must have! Ciao bella!
31,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great Pizza! Very open and friendly staff!
Prices are similar to any other good pizzeria. Definitely recommended!!!"
32,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious Italian food, the service was excellent even during a busy evening. The ravioli were amazing üíò recommended."
33,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This delightful little place is well hidden, but sure worth a visit. The only thing is that i think the menu could be a little bigger, other than that, it was just what we were looking for."
34,Eatmosfera, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Waited 20 minutes for our orders to be taken, the lady serving us didn't really care, started singing songs and talking on the phone. When we left without eating anything the response we got was ""good, I'll have more space in there"""
35,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"For the afficicianados of pure good quality italian kitchen...... the choice is limited, to hybrid handthrown pizzas,and nonna-level country pastas.....a favorite refuge of italian purists in amsterdam.
And the loveliest folks running it."
36,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had the Salsiccia pizza. Best Italian pizza I had in Amsterdam so far. Also one of the tastiest pizza I ever had. Highly recommended!
37,Eatmosfera, 1 star ,a year ago,"Ridiculous pricing for a rather underwhelming ""shrimp"" risotto. Expecting a beautifully seasoned, rich and creamy risotto (for an above average price in Amsterdam), I received cooked rice with some courgette squares and ONE, yes one poor ‚Ä¶"
38,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very authentic Italian experience, original staff and ingredients and a prime location in the heart of Amsterdam"
39,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Only tried the pizza, but it was very good and on par with other 'authentic' Italian places with wood fired ovens like La Perla, Sotto and Fuoco Vivo."
40,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best pizza of the 20 years I‚Äôve lived. Great atmosphere, great waiters, great wine.
10/10 :)"
41,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best pizza in town. We pick it up, run home and eat it whilst it‚Äôs still hot! Super nice people work there who already recognise us because we show up for pizza every 1-2 weeks ü§ó Grazie for the great service and amazing food üíõüçï"
42,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good pizza. Small and homey restaurant with Italian owners.
43,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Ate here recently with some friends and luckily got the last table after talking to the place via email as they are shut in the day. Am so glad we went. I love pizza and I love Neapolitan pizza - this place did not disappoint. Go, eat, ‚Ä¶"
44,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Great authentic Italian food, reasonable price."
45,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,For a really nice Italian taste i recommand this restaurant. Also the hospitality is very good. Call to be sure for a available table.
46,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"From the moment you enter the door, any doubt you may have about the authentic Italian experience is quickly dissipated: this place is a mess and you wouldn't expect anything less from Italians. Obviously in a review you can't judge the ‚Ä¶"
47,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food and service, pizza is typical italian. Must go."
48,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had the italian sausage pizza. Others at my table were fighting for bites after they got a taste of this extraordinary pizza. Highly recommend a stop here for pizza if you are in Amsterdam. This rivals places in Italy that are very good. The service was prompt but they are not very open to modifying dishes.
49,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small and slightly crammed place, that has a tendency to get loud. We got the last free table, but still got served quickly and the staff were very friendly and easy going. The cuisine feels genuinely Italian and every dish we tried was ‚Ä¶"

53,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely a little noisy but dishes are awesome
54,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delish freshly made pizza and kind, efficient service. We went when it wasn't crowded (7pm weekday) so food was served quite fast. Good wines as well. Will definitely recommend!"
55,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A small Italian restaurant with all the staff being Italians , authentic place with great food and wine.
The pizza were one of the greatest i had , with the tomato sauce being the best ‚Ä¶"
56,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place was great. I am American and we had already done traditional Dutch food (Moeders was incredible) for a few days and were wanting to try Italian in Europe to compare with how it is at home. I live in the Northeast Corridor which ‚Ä¶
57,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome hidden little gem in Amsterdam. A must for Italian pizza lovers :)
58,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Eatmosfera is an excellent Italian restaurant in the center of Amsterdam. It is located in a calm small street and it was quite difficult to find it but the pizza and the tiramisu were excellent. ‚Ä¶
59,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"English/Engels:
A nice Italian restaurant, with real Italian staff! The food was great and the service was good. So the most important aspects of a good restaurant are there. ‚Ä¶"

61,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My Wife and I didn‚Äôt get chance to try other Italian restaurants, as we were only in Amsterdam for a short period of time. But our dinner at Eatmosfera was Amazing! The pizzas were the best pizzas we have both had in years (highly ‚Ä¶"
62,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited this place 4 times due to proximity to my place. Pizza is really nice (Napoli style), the main courses are average and portions definitely not too generous. The place is extremely loud since they packed many seats in a small room ‚Ä¶"
63,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for pizza and pasta, in the touristy part of town and great value for money considering where you are. Also friendly staff, can definitely recommend when in the neighborhood. (Adjusted review from 4 to 5 stars since the desserts are some of the best we ever had in a Italian restaurant)"
64,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A cozy place with tasteful creations. The pizza was very good.
65,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing shrimp pasta and very good pizza
66,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I think this is the best Tiramisu I have eaten in a while. And I got inspirited by the obers enjoying their job and bringing a great eatmosphera ;-).
Besides that the Pizza was just beautiful. Looking forward to my next visit!!"
67,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Try the pizza buffala - it's really delicious and juicy.
68,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Napolitana type of pizza. You can feel it's homemade and fresh baked in a stone oven. The atmosphere is great and accompanied with friendly and timely service! ‚Ä¶
69,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Authentic Italian restaurant. The menu is rather small, but you can't miss here - the pizza and calzone are one of the best we've tasted, and the hand made pastas are amazing. The food is subtle and very accurate in taste. Simply excellent."
70,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We came without a reservation and got seated real quick (5 minutes before the restaurant actually opened) , insuring that our waitress knows that we don't have much time. we ordered one salad and pasta and waited 45 minutes to get our ‚Ä¶"
71,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is ok, restaurant is really loud though.
They messed up our order but corrected it and apologized.
The food was not good in my opinion. ‚Ä¶"
72,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I am not Italian so my frame of reference is limited. But I travel a lot and eat good food. I discovered this place randomly and had the best pizza of my life. On top of that I was served a tiramisu from heaven. You know what reserve your tiramisu as soon as you go there!
73,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was ok.
A bit crowded and noisy."
74,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best Italian food in Amsterdam! Everything is super fresh and delicious! Been here few times and will be coming back again. Recommend üîù
75,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good (not great), and the pesto dish that brought my wife had lots of pepper in it.  She is highly intolerant to pepper, so we asked if they could make her another dish.  They did, but we had to pay for another meal.  They said, ‚Ä¶"
76,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"All the dishes we ordered(group of 8 persons) were very tasty. Amazing tiramissu,  one of the best I have ever tasted. The place was very beautiful to enjoy your dinner!!"
77,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly staff, good location and delicious menu!"
78,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely Italian staff, really good food and great wine. Calzone was delicious, scallops were great, hot goat cheese appetizers fantastic, bufala pizza phenomenal, and so was the tiramis√π. Great for an evening of simple delicious food, light atmosphere and friends."
79,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here for dinner before a movie at nearby Pathe on a Saturday evening. Although we did not have a reservation, they seated told us the time we could have the table until, which was enough.  We ordered the pasta and pizza special of the ‚Ä¶"
80,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Didn't like the food much. The pizza tasted bit burnt. And I had a hard time convincing my kiddo to eat, even though she loves pizzas. Maybe it wasn't according to our taste buds..And yes, it was quite overpriced."
81,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Giving this place three stars just for its great  wine. The pizza was pathetic and watery. When I asked the waitress why it is so watery, I was told that is how it is supposed to be. Even the pasta was bland and tasteless. I may be had too high expectations after having read about it  but it was very disappointing."
82,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nothing special. Not sure why had such high rating. Didn't have first choice of wine so party plumped for another - pretty awful - not faulty but vegetal and short like so many low intervention wines fashion over substance. Service okay - could have been much better and not great value.
83,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best Italian restaurant in Amsterdam, pizza is very good, but the normal courses is where this place excels, fish courses in particular. Great list of wines and beers as well"
84,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Pizza reminds me of back home! If you‚Äôre feeling like being in Italy, drop by here!"
85,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic restaurant. Authentic Italian food and awesome staff. Really passionate about what they're doing and it comes through in the dining experience. Loved it. Highly recommended.
86,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the beef carpaccio, pasta w/sausage and white pizza. Finished with the tira misu. It was unbelievable. We were blown away how good it all was. Might be the best meal we‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs a must try!"
87,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful Italian restaurant. Loved all the food and service was friendly. Scallops to start were cooked perfectly; would also recommend the sea bream we had for mains
88,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,very delicious. book in advance if possible.
89,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great pizza, friendly staff and cozy place. On the negative side is that they don‚Äôt offer traditional Italian dishes like carbonara and the place is small and can be very packed."
90,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is a hidden gem. The pizza is absolutely sensational. Only fresh ingredients and very nice ham.
Nevertheless, the service was rude and not interested in us as guests at all."
91,Eatmosfera, 1 star ,2 years ago,The service is disrespectful. You pay 17‚Ç¨ for 5 raviolis which are good but really not worth the price. They talk behind you like you are stupid and make you believe it's the same in all Amsterdam. Go to Loulou pizzabar and it's gonna be night and day
92,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect Italian ‚Äúhome made‚Äù food style.
Service: very good
It always hard to find good quality food near touristic places, the place offers ‚Ä¶"
93,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Fantastic Italian place in amsterdam ! Maybe the top pizza in town
94,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fabulous restaurant. Unreal food, service & overall ambience. One of the best meals I‚Äôve ever had in an Italian restaurant, I‚Äôd highly recommend it. If you‚Äôre a tiramisu fan, you‚Äôre in for a treat! üòä"
95,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Terrific pizza, great service and wonderful atmosphere. The place is a bit crammed, so make sure to get a reservation. The dessert of the day (tiramisu) had run out, which was a drawback."
96,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a traditional Italian restaurant with friendly staff. There aren't a lot of tables so it is wise to reserve a table, especially if you plan to visit at rush hours. I had the pizza and it was excellent."
97,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had a great night at this clean and cozy place. I truly enjoyed the authentic Italian dinner experience.
The table service was above excellent and the quality of the food just could not be better in my honest opinion. I will enjoy coming back here in the future. Grazie mille !!!"
98,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Food is ok. Service is ok. Great dessert!
99,Eatmosfera, 1 star ,4 years ago,We visited this place 3 years ago and the food was a little bit pricey but the food was good. This time we went there to have a pizza. We've never had such a bad pizza ever before. It`s just another tourist trap in the city center.
100,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered a pizza with high expectations due to the high rating of this restaurant but unfortunately it was average and a burnt. However, my partner ordered pasta which I tried and it was good enough for me to forget that I ate an average and burnt pizza."
101,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing traditional Italian pizza
102,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I‚Äôve been here twices and I really love it. The place is cozy and the Italian stuff make you feel like you‚Äôre in Italy for some hours. They are super social. Just go here and enjoy this lovely restaurant
103,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,a year ago,Loves the pizza especially the dough. Their seafood pasta was nice too. Coffee was plain however

105,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Place run by Italians where Italians go when feeling homesick for Italy's food. Very friendly staff, very good food. Low raise light pizza and many other special dishes besides pizza. Wonderful homemade bread."
106,Eatmosfera, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"- forgot our drinks, had to re-order.
- long wait, no menu
- mosquitos / flies ‚Ä¶"
107,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice food, a little more sophisticated than the average Italian restaurant. It seems to be very crowded, so it's best to book a table if you want to eat here (saw a lot of people who couldn't get in anymore or had to wait quite a long time for a table...)"
108,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"pizza is tasty, dessert also"

113,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good pizzas. The restaurant is quite small, so you need to stay very near to the other customers, but the tasty food and the service compensate."
114,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Hidden gem on the very center of Amsterdam. Not a turistic place.. that's where Italians living in A'dam go for dinner. Interesting pizzas.. great menu with always very nice specials. Relaxing vibe too! Bravi ragazzi!
115,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"I'm Italian and I really love this restaurant! You can find the real Italian kitchen as well as the Italian hospitality!! Try the pizza, is amazing but don't forget to taste also the home made pasta! Love it!"
116,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very good pizza with creative and tasty options. I had fontina and speck and was delicious. In the center of the city - this is certainly a place I would recommend!
117,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Great taste of the food! But the price is pretty high while the portion is really little... I‚Äôm a small girl but I could not even get half full :(
118,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The best pizza I‚Äôve tried in Amsterdam!
119,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Italian food, Fair prices, Small Menu. Waiter's  speak Italian and English, located out of sight it can be easy to miss.
Worth bringing some one special, place is romantic and authentic."
120,Eatmosfera, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Awful service, rude staff. Ordered two pizzas and two bottles of wine and they could not serve a third pizza because they had reservations for 40 minutes later. Terrible."
121,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I celebrated my birthday here today and it was the best pizza and service was excellent and we enjoyed everything from the starter to the dessert. Truly the best place to visit
122,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best Italian restaurants you could find in Amsterdam. Right in the heart of city center. Would be a nice place to refill you up after couple of drinks.
123,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,come for the tiramisu and italian friendliness. stay for the tiramisu a second time. sourdough pizzas are great and pastas are superb.
124,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Baked goats cheese starter was delicious. Pizza dough was amazing and overall a very good Italian restaurant.
125,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Pizza was very juicy sauce so not too much to mine and my boyfriends taste but tasted delicious with a great crust
126,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It wasn't easy to get to this place, kind of hidden in a very small alley.
It is not big, but the food was good and the service was quick. I would recommend it for a quick dinner for a maximum of 4 people"
127,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cozy atmosphere, great food, good service. As far as Italian food goes, probably one of the best in the city."
128,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great Italian food, and one of the best tiramisu I've ever had. Reservation recommended unless you arrive early, gets really busy for dinner."
129,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I had an entree of prosciutto and mozzarella which was very good but the ravioli with butter sauce and the tiramisu were bad. If you‚Äôve been to Italy you‚Äôll be disappointed.
130,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nothing really special, I don‚Äôt understand the super high reviews. The food was, not super good or bad, but seems a bit overprice. The service was also just normal. The place is crowded, we had to sit very close to the people next to us."
131,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best pizza ever! Kind and friendly staff. We promised ourself to come back here when in Amsterdam.
132,Eatmosfera, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great plate of meat and cheese as starters, a bit small in space. Funny servants but pasta mains are a bit small. Still very recommended"
133,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My favorite Italian dining place in the city. Portions are small: if you ask only one main course you will leave hungry.
134,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Probably the best pizza I've had in my life! Delicious, but make a reservation before going. They are always full."
135,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, amazing ingredients, friendly staff. A hidden authentic Italian food gem within the heart of Amsterdam."
136,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing pizza, one of the best I've ever had. Will be a wait for a table as it's a tiny place. Worth it."
137,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Excellent ravioli, exquisite delicate sauce. It's a hit or ok sort of place - either its amazing, or only good. Either way can't go wrong. More gezellig than romantic."
138,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favourite pizza in Amsterdam, wide choice of wine and extremely nice staff. Recommend to everyone!"
139,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Hidden gem of a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam. Great food and wine and friendly staff. I'll definitely be back.

142,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very good food. Service is fast and nice. Also good white wine. I would recommend to reservate because it's a small restaurant.
143,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The MOS stands for mosquitos it seems. They were all over and really ruined the evening. Food is good but small portions and very expensive for what it is
144,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nicest Italian restaurant in Amsterdam. The house wine is pretty decent. The crudo pizza is a must.
145,Eatmosfera, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food good but portion sizes for the pasta was very small,  not good value in my opnion."
146,Eatmosfera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious wood fire pizza.
