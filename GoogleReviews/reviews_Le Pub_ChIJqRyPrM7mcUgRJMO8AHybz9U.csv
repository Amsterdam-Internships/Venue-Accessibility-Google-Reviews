0,Le Pub, 5 stars ,a month ago,"One of the most important venues for bands and artists in South Wales. Have always felt well looked after and safe here, due in part to their zero tolerance of d***heads. Always doing something good for the wider community and will always be one of my favourite places to play. Plus, their vegan food is top ranking‚Ä¶ LOVE"

5,Le Pub, 5 stars ,a month ago,I wish I lived closer so that I could come more often. I'm very grateful to Sam and her team for always making my band feel welcome when we play there. She always tries to make it worth our while despite us being utterly dire and bringing in an average of four extra punters per gig. True community pub.
6,Le Pub, 5 stars ,a month ago,"A unique and welcoming venue with great service and beers. I‚Äôm not a vegan, but their food appeals to everyone. Great music venue who are celebrating 30 years of being at the heart of a reviving local music scene. ‚Ä¶"

51,Le Pub, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great vegan only pub, let down smugly 3 by propping the door open so that it was cold (they did close when asked why it was open), and also the music was a bit too loud for easy conversation. The food was really good though!"
52,Le Pub, 1 star ,2 years ago,This is probably the worst music venue I've been to. At first it seemed like it would be cool but the state of it inside ruined it. I agree with what others have said about the state of the toilets and the disgusting smell. I complained to ‚Ä¶
