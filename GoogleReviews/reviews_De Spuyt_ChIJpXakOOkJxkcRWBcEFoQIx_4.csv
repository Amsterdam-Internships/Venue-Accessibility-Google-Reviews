2,De Spuyt, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very cosy, good music and a lot of tasty beers."
3,De Spuyt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A worn down and dirty brown café that is absolutly lovely. Found down a narrow street from the Leidse plein. They have a great selection of beer on tap and bottle served by the nicest guy.
4,De Spuyt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good selection of beers and a very friendly staff. Music choice was perfect (they had Rodriguez playing when we arrived) and volume was just high enough to listen to, just low enough to talk effortlessly with my friend. A perfect experience."
5,De Spuyt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great bar, a little off the beaten path so not packed with tourists.  Beer selection is awesome. You can get the coveted Westvleeteren or just ask the bar tender for a recommendation and you will have many choices from traditional Belgian Trappist to new Dutch craft brews."

14,De Spuyt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really cool old pub a few minutes walk from Leidseplein that has a very large selection of beers. The staff is always friendly and the space is cool and dark. There are very few food options here besides bar bites but that is also part of the charm. Ask about the cellar beer specials, always a surprise and reasonably priced."
15,De Spuyt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A rare site in otherwise tourist-trap filled corner of the city: good beer bar. Always a solid selection of drafts, mostly coming from A'dam breweries as well as extended set of bottles from all over the place.

21,De Spuyt, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"lovely 'hidden' cafe near Leidseplein, but mostly locals and tourists that want to escape from the usual tourist attractions. So many nice (craft) beers to choose from and a good atmosphere (can also vouch for the cheese tosti!). celebrated my birthday here last year in summer :)"

31,De Spuyt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A small off the beaten path gem for some top notch craft and draught beer selections, I had the Jopen IPA off draught and a bottled oak aged St Bernadus abt 12... Simply delicious stuff here and all at not too shabby prices either."
