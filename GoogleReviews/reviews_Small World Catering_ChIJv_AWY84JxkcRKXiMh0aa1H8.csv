0,Small World Catering, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Most delicious sandwiches in Amsterdam! I need to limit myself so I don‚Äôt go more often. I was so excited to find a turkey sandwich. And then to discover one on focaccia and with roasted peppers and Tabasco Mayo - wow. All the sandwiches ‚Ä¶

6,Small World Catering, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"As another reviewer pointed out,  it's not the cheapest place. However it was one of the tastiest sandwiches that I've ever had, in terms of flavours and the quality of the ingredients. The turkey was the best that I've ever had and not dry like it can be sometimes. It also had some peppers on, which again where incredibly tasty."

43,Small World Catering, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Perfect for the macho crowd . Food is not as good as it used to be. Loud like a thousand knives through your ears... non-apologetic and borderline offensive sarcasm when confronted with mistakes such as missing items or double charge.
