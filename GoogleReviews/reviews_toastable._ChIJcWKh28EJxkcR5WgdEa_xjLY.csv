4,toastable., 3 stars ,a week ago,"Fine, but not special. I had tosti at other places and they were much better. They use very ordinary bread, cheese, as well as ham. Quite expensive considering the simplicity and quality of ingredients they use here. Coffee was good."

11,toastable., 5 stars ,4 months ago,"(*updated review) Toastable Koningsplein is (still) a nice place to enjoy a delicious toastie (UK), grilled cheese sandwich (US) / jaffle (Australia) / croque monsieur (France).

25,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place with delicious toasts, a very friendly staff and quite affordable prices! Was here every morning during my trip in Amsterdam. If you visit the place during the busy hours just be patient, because it can take 20min until you get your order. But it is definitely worth the wait!"
26,toastable., 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant is located in the heart of Amsterdam, the interior is very comfortable and the atmosphere quite nice. You don't get service at the table, you need to stand up and order but the food gets delivered to your place. The food ‚Ä¶"

28,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome toastis! Delicious ingredients, well cooked bread and cheap prices for Amsterdam standards!

30,toastable., 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cosy and friendly ambiences. The classic sandwiche I ordered tastes quite salty for me but still good. A variety of orange juice made me too happy to choose one.

32,toastable., 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ordered an iced green tea & a caprese sandwich (its actually 3 slices of bread). The place is kind of underground, you walk down stairs. It's cozy but there's enough seating and they also have outdoor seating available. Good service, affordable food, would recommend."
33,toastable., 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute place with awesome service! Toasties are delicious and well composed. I just wish there were more vegan options to choose from. I am still happy to have options anyway.  Me and my colleagues were very happy with everything.

The Caf√© is nice and cozy. The personnel is very friendly and gave us some good advises."
55,toastable., 3 stars ,6 months ago,Ok tosti‚Äôs. 3 stars because they removed my favorite tosti from their menu. The chorizo tosti was amazing

65,toastable., 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent sandwich! My niece and I both chose the Fajita which was nigh on perfect. It was *loaded* and had the right amount of spice, which is unusual for a Dutch place (the spices are typically dumbed down to suit local taste buds). One ‚Ä¶"

68,toastable., 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent place.  Really central. Perhaps the most value for money place we visited at Amsterdam
69,toastable., 4 stars ,3 years ago,Super tasty toast! Great variety of fillings. Sauces add extra flavour. Too bad the location is so small and gets super windy if the door is left open. But I do recommend going there and trying to eat your meal outside on the terrace.
70,toastable., 5 stars ,4 months ago,Yummy üòã
71,toastable., 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice variation of grilled sandwiches. Additional toppings are possible. Good selection of drinks

79,toastable., 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fan of toasted sandwiches?  Even if you're not, this place is amazing.  Triple decker toasties are the speciality and we actually visited twice over a three day trip.  We tried four different varieties and they were all amazing.  Cute ‚Ä¶"
80,toastable., 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great toasties, fantastic staff - friendly and welcoming. Cozy and comfortable and just off the main tourist routes so seems lovely and quiet! Made an effort to come back here with a group of friends after a previous visit to Amsterdam and was not disappointed!"
81,toastable., 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Went here twice on my visit to Amsterdam with my boyfriend, he loved the toastie so much he kept looking for an opportunity for us to get back here for another! The breakfast menu is lovely here too! And the fresh orange juice in the morning is perfect."
82,toastable., 4 stars ,2 years ago,We found this place after allot of shopping in need of a pick me up/warm me up. The toasties are delicious and the staff were very accommodating as it was busy. My toastie was a tad ‚Äútoo‚Äù cheesy but otherwise awesome!
83,toastable., 5 stars ,4 months ago,In Love with The Legend ‚ô•
84,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love this place. We go here every time we go to Amsterdam now. It has a great selection of sandwiches which are always toasted to perfection. There isn't much space which means you quite often have to wait for a table but well worth it in my opinion.
85,toastable., 5 stars ,2 years ago,The veggie toasty with bacon was great!
86,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down a great ham and cheese toastie. Staff was friendly and while the prep took a bit of time, I enjoyed every delicious bite! I have tagged this as a great go-to whenever I spend time near Amsterdam."

88,toastable., 5 stars ,5 years ago,Really delicious tosties. Small and  cozy souterrain. Happy waiters too.
89,toastable., 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amsterdam has a lot of small food shop like this one but none of them is as welcoming or serves such well prepared toasted sandwiches (Their ""the unit"" toast is to die for) . Everything and everyone is great, from the food to the staff (even the bathroom!) Special thanks to Anna!"
90,toastable., 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Quite escape from the tourist crowd with ample menu to satisfy various tastes. Prices are cool, waitresses are friendly. I most like the lunch menu with the pumpkin soup."
91,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best toasts I've ever eaten: fully garnished with fresh, tasty and quality ingredients. Vegen is absolutely my favorite and also the peanut butter, Nutella and banana one. Carrot cake is also a must. ‚Ä¶"
92,toastable., 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Really good toasties, but horrendously typical dutch service. We sat outside and saw our server twice, once to take the order and once to bring our food which wasn't how we ordered it. I'd recommend skipping the bad service and ordering a take away instead. This also has the side benefit of your food being prepared much faster."
93,toastable., 5 stars ,5 months ago,Nice sandwiches and friendly staff !
94,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A cosy, welcoming lower level sandwich place with lots of tasty toasting sandwiches to choose from. Verity of good coffee and drinks are offered. Hosts are welcoming and responsive. ‚Ä¶"

97,toastable., 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Not the cheapest, but nice ambience and our server was bubbly and charming which made the place seem warm and friendly. The toasty was so photogenic my daughter was moved to post it to her Instagram account and it tasted pretty good too. I had the classic which involved cheese and ham and seemed to be a croc monsieur by any other name."
98,toastable., 4 stars ,6 years ago,"This is a beautiful, quaint little cafe perfect for any fussy eaters. You have a build your own breakfast option which means you get exactly what you want. The coffees are really nice although lattes etc are more lukewarm than hot."
99,toastable., 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably the best ""toast experience"" in my life. Place is very small and tiny. There is no possibility to have any alcohol. Good juices."
100,toastable., 3 stars ,3 years ago,Rude service. Server with tattoos over her arms ignored me at the door. Then when I asked what milks were available as we don't use dairy she held her hand out and looked at me like I'd asked a really stupid question. Just because you know ‚Ä¶
101,toastable., 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good food for reasonable prices in a small bug bright basement. Very nice staff.
102,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,Californication toasted is the flame. Add chicken. David Duchovny and Action Bronson would approve major.

111,toastable., 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very very good food and lovely atmosphere. Service was very nice and happy. I ate ""the legend"" which was extremely good! Overall, really good. I walked out with a smile. :)"
112,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely wonderful place for a quick bite into the most lustrous cheese toasties! Triple layered, grilled sandwiches with fresh ingredients make this a go to place for lunch and dinners!"
113,toastable., 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good coffee in a cute little corner shop. Nice big windows, bar seating looking out onto the streets and canals. Coffee was good although needed 5mins to cool to become drinkable. Would happily return again."
114,toastable., 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very delicious, and good service"
115,toastable., 5 stars ,2 years ago,There is nothing else to say but a great little find. Full of locals so you know it is good and the food and service is top notch. Perfect way to start the day.
116,toastable., 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great concept in its simplicity, not the best execution.  Service was lacking, toasties were good but were a little dry.  Really needed the sauces to liven them up.  Wouldn't necessarily go back."
117,toastable., 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic place!
Great Service, tasty breakfast items. Totally worth visiting, but come early if you want to have a seat :)"

129,toastable., 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ate there a couple of times and the food was very good. I‚Äôd recommend it  to everyone near Amsterdam ‚ÄúCentrum‚Äù

130,toastable., 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Was nice, but i would never call something 3 layered, when the 3rd one is only bread. Only my humble opinion. Staff was really helpful and sweet."
131,toastable., 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Great food!
132,toastable., 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best cheese sandwich ever. I wish they'd add a tobasco sauce option but there's no real need for it.
