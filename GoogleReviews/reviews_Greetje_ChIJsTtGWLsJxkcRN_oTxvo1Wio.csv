34,Greetje, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent food, great atmosphere. The owner is a nice guy and serves real Dutch food. There aren't many restaurants that offer modern Dutch food. They will explain the dishes they serve, and what ingredients they used. They will make an effort to talk to you in your own language. Yes, it is expensive, but worth the money."
35,Greetje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Our last night of vacation, and I wanted to eat here.  The decor is beautifully Dutch, it's located in a nice area close to lots of hotels, and the food was amazing.  The waitstaff were all very nice.  I heard a couple inquiring if the …"

45,Greetje, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We were seated and waited around 15 mins before even receiving the menu. We decided to leave after given the slow service. Given the prices (at least 100 euros for two people to eat and drink) we expected better service. The manager was apologetic about the slow service at least. We left before eating.

51,Greetje, 2 stars ,5 years ago,2.5 - I don't think this place is for everyone. It has some pretty interesting flavours which I wasn't a fan of and the service was slow and the food was quite pricey. I'd say give it a go if you would consider yourself an adventurous eater …
52,Greetje, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The food is really good so no comments there. It was a really great food experience. The atmosphere was terrible though. It was super quiet and serious. I can imagine that it would be better on a Friday in the middle of winter but personally I wouldn't go again.

59,Greetje, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The main dish cod is so plain even with the sauce. The peach desert tastes like one from a supermarket.
