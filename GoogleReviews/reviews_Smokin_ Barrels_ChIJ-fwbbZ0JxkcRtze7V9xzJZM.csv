0,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Does exactly what it says on the sign and does it really well. We went as a big group and basically had beers, ribs and burgers! They were excellent.
Small, kind of cosy place, friendly staff. Really enjoyed it."
1,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I thought the food was outstanding. I ordered lamsrack and my girlfriend the royal cheese burger. Tried a bit of her burger and that too tasted great. Nice atmosphere and a cosy feel.
2,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing burgers, good drinks selection and a nice dusky atmosphere. I spent a happy few hours with my wife eating wonderful food and getting lightly drunk. Highly recommended."
3,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place! Went to Smokin‚Äô Barrels for date night with my boyfriend. I had the Old Mount Passionfruit (apple cider) and he a few IPAs (they have quite a selection of beers, on top and bottled), we were pretty hungry so we ordered three ‚Ä¶"
4,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good burgers with a nice variety of fries. The Veggie burger is surprisingly tasty. Interior is cosy and they have a big outdoor seating with heating system in winter. Staff is overall friendly! Accessibility : toilets are at the first floor.
5,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great steak and spare ribs, large selection of beers available. Nice crowd on a Friday night, turns into more of a bar after dinner hours."
6,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really great food! The burger on the picture is called Notorious B.I.G üëåüëå I'm surely going back for the Quarter pounder + Lobster!!
7,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best burger pub in town. Exquisite hamburgers with very good ingredients and a lot of variety in the menu with different kinds of meat. Plus very good beers and ciders. What's even better is the sweet potato fries, the best I've ever ‚Ä¶"
8,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Service took way too long. (Super friendly waitress though, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm giving it 2 stars in stead of 1.)

9,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome bar and restaurant. Super cozy feeling, very stylish as well. The burgers we had were absolutely amazing and the beer selection is just phenomenal. You should definitely try the Punk IPA. Highly recommend this place."
10,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Stopped by for a burger, fries and a pint. I sat outside and there was a  nice ambiance with space heaters and people chatting. The burger I had was the best burger I've ever had and it was the Smokin' Barrel burger. The fries were also great and beer selection was nice. Can't wait to go back."
11,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Randomly walked into this place for a quick bite and ended up staying for several hours drinking beers after dinner. They have a great beer selection, welcoming ambiance, good music playlist, and a very friendly staff. The food is also ‚Ä¶"
12,Smokin' Barrels, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Below average experience. I went there with a friend on Saturday night for burgers and beers. For my beer I was given a glass that clearly was not washed after the previous customer, and it took unreasonably long to get a new one. Burgers ‚Ä¶"
13,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent burgers and great choice of local microbrewery beers. Recommended to check this place out by front desk team at Student Hotel. Has a covered area outdoors for dining and drinking. Popular with young crowd although I took a family ‚Ä¶
14,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice and tender Argentinean steaks and good burgers. Good selection of beers and a spacious terrace where smoking is allowed. Very reasonably priced, I wish I tried their spare ribs!"
15,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not a bad experience. When we needed a very quick bite, the staff was kind, helpful and delivered (in and out under half an hour, great job). The ribs were good in taste, but a bit dry. The wine was quite terrible; room for improvement."
16,Smokin' Barrels, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The burger was nice. The steak was inedible. But let‚Äôs say that happened. Another place in Amsterdam which is customer ‚Äúunfriendly‚Äù. Although I couldn‚Äôt eat my stake, not only I had to pay for it, but they didn‚Äôt offer to bring me something else or even a simple glass of beer."
17,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good selection of tasty burgers and steaks for a decent price - by Amsterdam standards. During our visit on a Thursday evening, the service was somewhat slow and not particularly friendly - room to improve here."
18,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Went here on the recommendation of a friend. We were there on a Friday evening and the place was packed inside with a waiting time of 45 minutes. Looking around the place it wasn't that big at all. We opted to sit outside with the heaters. ‚Ä¶
19,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've been here already 3 times and will keep coming. Very good customer service of all staff. Music is great and food is delicious. Try Ari gold burger and any of the steaks. Price of the cote du boeuf (800g) is on the high side (60eur) ‚Ä¶
20,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great burgers and nice attentive staff. It's usually very busy so can take take a while to receive the order but it's worth it. They also have a decent beer selection.
21,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"OK, it was a Sunday evening, but either you stay open and provide the same service as on a Friday or Saturday or you don't stay open. The people working there just made a tired impression. Just a bit slow to respond, not enthusiastic; we ‚Ä¶"
22,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Definetly NOT the Best burgers in Amsterdam. I do not consider going again but I liked the sweet potato fries more than anything else. If you insist on eating something, at least get the Rendang Burger which has a proper taste. Cheese ‚Ä¶"
23,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Unexpected visit and unexpectedly good burgers. Really nice and cosy place. When I was there there wasn't many people and we didn't have to wait for our orders. Worth checking it out if you are in neighbourhood.
24,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great burgers and the waitress was extremely helpful and friendly. She turned me on to some new beer that i loved and I highly recommend you try the 'return of the Mac' burger. Will go again!
25,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good place, their prices are a bit high but the food and cocktails are good. Try their beer cocktails for example, they don't kill the meat either, the home made fries are excellent. I would say this is the place for you if you have some extra money to spend."
26,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff. But after waiting an hour, we had to call over our waiter to ask about the food we ordered. They had forgotten about it. Took another 30 min to get our bill after asking about that as well. Burger was okay. Not worth waiting for though."
27,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Huge menu, nice staff, great food and drinks, what more do you need? We loved it there and enjoyed it very much. Ribs great, Steak great, perfect!"
28,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is the perfect place for a Friday night burger and beer.   I'm a fairly uncomplicated guy and so my standard order is a Royale with Cheese, fries and a beer from the tap.  Good selection of Belgian standards: Affligem, Brugse Zot, La ‚Ä¶"
29,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The service here was amazing. Our waiter was very friendly and walked is through the whole menu. I had the foie gras burger, and it might have been the best I've eaten."
30,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Service is nice and staff are friendly. It is pity that they didn't provide lobster on Sunday evening.
31,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place to grab a good burger, menu has a decent amount of choices. They do have a huge selection of beer to choose from. Nice terrace to sit outside and around the corner of the trainstation"
32,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place to eat. It's off the beaten track but is worth walking too. I had the chicken, was a little pink, but tasted great. A lot of drinks to chooses from. Would highly recommend this place."
33,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We ordered the ‚Äústicky fingers‚Äù for 2 people and it was amazing. Rib eye, fried chicken and burger - all very good. I would definitely suggest this place."
34,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Even though they did not have lobster when we went, was blown away with the burger. I had the.. Rangotan? Vietnamese style burger with picked veggies and a fastastic penut sauce. The chicken skewar as also perfectly none- really juicy. Will be back."

38,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Sunday roast , not the best . Food arrived promptly but was luke warm . Sent it back . Tiny portion of mash , carrots hard , yorkshire pud shop bought . Plus side waitress very pleasant . Was given 10% off but would rather of had more mash !"

51,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, great burgers, buffalo wings need some work, they were more like bbq wings, other then that a great place to eat."
52,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really awesome place, great selection of craft beers (local and international) and a good variety of food. American style really I guess but that's what we were looking for at the time."
53,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Terrible service, pathetic lobster and over priced. The ribs look great but everything else I saw was underwhelming.  Even the steak was over cooked and with a big tendon running through the middle."
54,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool to have beers with friends. Burgers were good, but maybe not as great as people are saying in the reviews. Maybe I'm just over burgers."
