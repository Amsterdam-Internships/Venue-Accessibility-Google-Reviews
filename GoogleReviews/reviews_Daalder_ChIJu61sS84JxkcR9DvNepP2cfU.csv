0,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"A great place to start our trip in Amsterdam.
Everything was perfect at this michelin star restaurant- from the friendly service to the amazing dishes in the tasting menu we had. …"
1,Daalder, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"I did't really have good experience in this restaurant. The food was nice but the service was very slow. The waitresses are friendly. So, I started eating at 18:50 and be advised to get 6 courses as the restaurant needs to be closed at …"
2,Daalder, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Excellent 5 course lunch, with an interesting wine pairing.

The dishes were very good, which is expected in a restaurant of this standing, …"
3,Daalder, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Best menu-box we had till now, it came with instruction clips on YouTube and a spotify Playlist."
4,Daalder, 3 stars ,a month ago,"We absolutely loved the food, however the total experience felt not really worth the money (€ 300 p.p.). The seating was crowded, the music loud, the service was very dependent on which waiter, and the 22:00 closing time was not managed …"
5,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"A beautiful restaurant with a hipster design, this artistic environment is welcoming and friendly. But the real reason you should come is the heavenly food. The Michelin star restaurant certainly does not disappoint with each plate …"
6,Daalder, 2 stars ,a month ago,"I used to love Daalder (the Jordaan place before the Michelin start) and before the pandemic, I went very regularly. For lunch, business, I took clients. The food was always outstanding, and there was passion perceivable in the team. I was …"
7,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Phenomenal food. The starters amazing. Fantastic staff, cool vibe. My new favourite 1 star tied with Bougainville in Amsterdam."
8,Daalder, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Had to wait 15 mins to get seated. Then waited for 1 hour to get the desserts. Loud music, the interior is weird, the atmosphere is not cozy. Waiters forget to bring you cutlery, had to ask twice for a wine refill. Out of 8 courses, only 3 …"
9,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Daalder is an excellent restaurant headed by chef Dennis Huwaë, offering up Michelin quality meals in this popular dining venue along Lindengracht in Amsterdam. …"
10,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Daalder was fantastic. We had the 7-course tasting menu and it was delightful from start to finish (especially the slow-cooked egg). The service was prompt, and every interaction we had with the staff was great. Our waitress even took time from her day to appease us and take our photo outside. Can’t recommend Daalder enough."
11,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What a wonderful discovery this was! Great service, not too fancy, outdoor seating and the food! With each dish you go on an amazing flavour trip. The subtleties, the explosions, the refinement, the plating: all top notch! Here you get high cuisine for a reasonable price. 10s across the board!"
12,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Five stars, for good flavours and execution.

Vegetarian menu could be a little more exciting. …"
13,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the 7-course meal and every single dish was out-of-this-world delicious! Portions were just right, ingredients were tasty, subtle, and fresh. Chef Dennis even served us and had a nice chat. Service was excellent. If I could give a 6-star, I would."
14,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"As a treat for our anniversary and trip to visit friends we decided to look up a Michelin Star restaurant. Worth it. Every dish a masterpiece, every staff interaction a delight, ambiance bright and fun. Chef Dennis was on the floor and present throughout the entire service. He is working hard at earning his second star and it shows"
15,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Phenomenal experience. We traveled around Europe eating at top rated restaurants including three that earned one or more Michelin stars. This restaurant — yet to earn their star — was by far our favorite! …
16,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had read several outstanding reviews before visiting for dinner, and it certainly did not disappoint. …"
17,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I had a four course lunch (no meat) with the half glass wine pairing to go with it (4 glasses of wine is too much for me - especially when I have a flight to catch in a few hours). …
18,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,You need to try! They sever small dishes in a range of 5-7 dish course menu for dinner. Food is amazing with variety of taste combination. A perfect mix and match. We enjoyed every single dish. Service is also great. Love the place!
19,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best dinners I've had in a while. I got to sit at the bar facing the chefs. It was entertaining watching them work the delicate dishes with precision. The chefs also gladly answered my questions about the dishes and gave me …
20,Daalder, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Ordered this for home delivery. You should know that you are ordering a do it yourself meal (plan for at least one hour of preparation), not a meal ready to be enjoyed. Besides, you need to have an oven at your home."
21,Daalder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, mega nice staff, BUT service is soooo slow! I had a reservation at 18h, ordered the daalder menu (7 courses with wine pairing) and the dessert course was served only around 22h. That is almost unacceptable! But food was really …"
22,Daalder, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It was epic. Service was amazing, pairings were perfect, the 7 courses were exactly what we needed for this humid summer heat wave (light and fresh). I'm already planning to come back."
23,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We celebrated my moms birthday here last night. I think we had the best table in the dining room (thank you!!) and the service was beyond fantastic. All waiters are extremely attentive, very descriptive of all dishes and on point with …"
24,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The best meal we've had in Amsterdam. We had the seven course meal and couldn't fault any of it. The staff were also very friendly. We'll definitely be back soon.
25,Daalder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A wonderful evening. Daalder: plates like paintings, tastes like new experiences, service like warmth, happiness ánd fun. I fully enjoyed and experienced 8 courses (including the cheese platter) in this restaurant in the best company. All …"
26,Daalder, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"README:
1. Don't look at the menu, just go
2. Book the 10 course lunch/dinner …"
27,Daalder, 5 stars ,a year ago,Crazy good food and great service. You pay for the quality and creativity of the food.
28,Daalder, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Restaurant and terrace in the heart of the Jordaan district. Amazing finedining food and wines, a foodies must!"
29,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had the lunch four course special with half pairing of wine. The food looked and tasted amazing! Service was great too.
30,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"ticks all the boxes: fine dining but even with a big appetite more than enough. good winelist and nice staff. the smaller annex has bad acoustics, so can be a bit loud."
31,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best food experiences I had in 2017. Brilliant menu, friendly and very  knowledgeable staff. All in all a great experience! I shall return :D"
32,Daalder, 5 stars ,a year ago,11 plates... amazing dinner but strange to find a usually lively restaurant basically empty with less than 1/3 of tables offered; excellent food and service. one criticism: when making the reservation a few days ago (with deposit) still …
33,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food. Bold combinations,  explosive  tastes, good wine pairings.  Love at first spoon"
34,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just straight up a great experience. Wine, service, food all of it was spot on!"
35,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In my humble opinion, the best restaurant in Amsterdam! In my top 3 in the world. Michelin star quality food in a relaxed atmosphere with a lovely team who could not be more friendly or helpful. I fly over just for a meal here and it never …"
36,Daalder, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had the 5 course meal with wine for 2 at home, Thuis met Daalder. Superb. Surprise extras, excellent instruction videos, delicious food carefully prepared for completion at home.  More than just a lovely meal, this is an engaging culinary experience. Highly recommended."
37,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Out of this world! Superb food, creative, contemporary, attractive plating, and did not compromise on flavour one bit - delicious every dish! Great wine pairing too. Thoroughly recommend this place. We met the head chef - very talented, humble guy. Friendly service."
38,Daalder, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Got 'take away' from this restaurant. You get all the prepared elements of the dishes and assemble them at home (instructions are in Dutch, so easier if you know some). Very well thought and very nice food. Great experience."
39,Daalder, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Trendy presentation and interesting taste combinations - but most dishes were much too salty, and service quality tapered off towards the end of our meal."
40,Daalder, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Mixed feelings after the visit. Friendly and good service even if they served shellfish to the person who was allergic (and no excuse after), good that she did not take a bite. We had their 7 course set menu with wine pairing. Their …"

#porkmafia inda house"
42,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I booked a table at Daalder for my fiances birthday and it exceeded my expectations. Our dining experience was flawless from start to finish. The service was friendly, attentive and professional and I felt looked after throughout the …"
43,Daalder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and we were very impressed. When we first arrived, we were seated at the absolute worst table in the restaurant. One of the waitresses sensed that we were not happy without me even having to say …"
44,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It had been quite a few years since I had been to Daalder, when there was another chef in the kitchen, and the place had been on my list for a while. Am I glad I went yesterday! Together with a good friend we had a bar seat and I would …"
45,Daalder, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Impressive new chef made me clean the plate with my tongue.

The Daalder was one of my favourite places back in 2009. It was a usual brown …"
46,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Another superb meal at this small restaurant.  Since last year it has had a makeover and looks great. The food is just as amazing and all the staff are so friendly and hospitable. We had 5 course tasting menu with wine. Superb. A must in Amsterdam.
47,Daalder, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Did the 7 course tasting menu in a group of 4. Food was nice but not particularly memorable. …
48,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful, but honest real food. Excellent wines."
49,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was hands down the best food we had on our recent trip to Europe and we are at a fantastic 2 Michelin star restaurant in Valencia Spain a few days before. …
50,Daalder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I had dinner here with my wife. The food was well done, they only have a tasting menu and you chose how many courses you want based on how hungry you are. You don't get to decide what you eat, but it's nice to be surprised! The food was all …"
51,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An absolutely wonderful restaurant. Daalder perfectly straddles the line between fine dining and relaxed Dutch atmosphere. The taster menu, comprised of a variety of perfectly formed dishes, is a veritable feast for the eyes and tastebuds; …"
52,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Valentines evening with my wife, diner at the bar, surrounded by great hosts who served delicious food, made and presented with passion. Next to that we met some lovely people from Houston, Texas. A restaurant that we will recommend to all our friends and where we will be again soon!"
53,Daalder, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Because the place has been very successful and had great reviews, the chef decided to rise the quality by introducing a fixed menu: you don't choose what to eat, just how much.  We had 5 dishes and the food was really amazing: the …"
54,Daalder, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food indeed very good but service disappointing. For this price getting 3 amuses at the same time, not getting a wine cooler for the white wine, not having any pauses between the courses and losing our jackets seems unnecessarily annoying and disturbed what would otherwise have been a great culinary evening."
55,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the five course tasting menu with wine pairings. I won't ruin it for you so I'll only say that it was excellent from start to finish. A great experience that we both enjoyed over three hours. Yes, it's not cheap, but treat yourself, you deserve it..."
56,Daalder, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good food and very pleasant service. The tuna tartare was exceptional!  Some of the wine pairings were curious and, in the way of most set-menu modern restaurants, not everything worked.  Not mind-blowing gastronomy, but a good experience."
57,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful dinning experience. A bit pricey, but worth it."
58,Daalder, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Overall I felt the experience came way short of the cost. Don’t get me wrong- there were some amazingly thought out dishes (especially when the chef incorporated fish and the egg dish). But the lamb was way too chewy. It was very difficult …
59,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Perfect setting outside on the terrace on the first really warm evening. Excellent composition with great wines. Service friendly and relaxed yet very attentive. So comfortable to dine alone but really worth sharing with friends or even better a bit of romance.
60,Daalder, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We visited Tuesday 4 August without a reservation and the staff were very accommodating, giving us a seat at the bar whilst we waited for a table to come free.  I would highly recommend this restaurant, it is excellent.  We went for the 3 …"
61,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I cannot recommend this restaurant enough! Delicious, creative, complex, and thoughtful menu...consistent through the entire 5 courses. The service was outstanding. Tony was a fantastic sommelier, very knowledgeable. We greatly enjoyed his …"
62,Daalder, 2 stars ,a month ago,Feels like the Zara of fine dining. But expensive.
63,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Quite possibly Daalder makes to the top 3 best meals EVER. What a pleasure it was to have such different flavors play havoc on my palette and the presentation was spot on. Everything was fantastic. The staff was great especially Jessica.
64,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"By far the best restaurant in de Jordaan! IMHO they deserve a Michelin star. Rich flavours, different textures, delicious wines, friendly staff. It’s a hidden gem and you would easily miss it as from the outside it looks more like a bar than a fine dining restaurant."
65,Daalder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Daalder restaurant excels at accessible fine dining. Located in the charming Jordaan neighborhood of Amsterdam, the space feels welcoming with understated elegance. A marble top bar is the focal point of the small dining room, a throwback …"
66,Daalder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great dishes with lots of depth and flavour. A 7 course meal though is quite a lot of food with the generous portions served. Would definitely come again on a day a 5 course meal is available.
67,Daalder, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This gem can be found tucked away from the tourist attractions and the hustle and bustle of central Amsterdam. Arguably one of the most friendly restaurant experiences I have experienced aboard, and certainly the most relaxed so far visited …"
68,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Are there March 23 and every bite was unique and delicious. The Chef strives for perfection in every dish. The staff, including the Chef, were polite, friendly and describe the details to mouth-watering delight. I will be back next month with friends."
69,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This just became my favourite restaurant in Amsterdam. The place is so down to earth and unpretentious, but the care for a high standard and those details is amazing and still comes so natural and comfortable. The food is nothing short of …"
70,Daalder, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"We travelled to Amsterdam recently from Brisbane,Australia and had Christmas lunch at Daalder.
The food was some of the best we have experienced.All five courses were …"
71,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was by far one of the best dining experiences we have ever had in ANY country. The food was creative and extraordinary. The service was excellent. You should go to Amsterdam just to eat here!
72,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"AMAZING! A must try place in Jordaan! The chef is quite possibly one of the nicest, coolest most talented chefs I have ever met! Every course was better than the next! Ask him the process in which he cooks his eggs... the time and detail he puts into his dishes is extraordinary. I can’t wait to go back!"
73,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We loved Daalder! Delicious, surprising food and friendly, fun, unpretentious service. Super cozy restaurant, great wine from a not overwhelming menu, and a fun atmosphere with other tables close by. Perfect for a celebratory meal and we would love to go back!"
74,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Located at a rather quiet corner in the Jordaan you'll find restaurant Daalder. There is a set menu and the choice is whether to go for the 5 or the 7 course version. We went for the 5 course menu (69 euro) with a wine arrangement (40 …
75,Daalder, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, great atmosphere.... although we had to pay a €120 deposits to book the table for the Saturday night, which they had not taken out of the final bill. They where not at all apologetic when we caught them out on it. Felt like they where trying to steal €120 from us.
Be Aware!!!"
76,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Innovative daring and very tasty dishes.
77,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Restaurant Daalder specializes in a fixed price chef's choice menu. On my visit the dishes were absolutely lovely, particularly the duck and the miniature sandwich that was served as an amuse bouche. …"
78,Daalder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"You don't chose your dishes here, only the amount of courses. Very interesting combination of tastes, very well executed. Staff is super well trained and enormously friendly. …"
79,Daalder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Love the concept: decide how many courses you want, describe likes/dislikes/allergies and then be entertained with a selection from the chef. The food was delicious and innovative, and it looked amazing too. Loved it!"
80,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My husband and I had dinner last night at Daalder Eten & Drinken. From the staff, to the incredibly delicious and creative surprise tasting and wine pairing menu, etc,  we couldn't have enjoyed it more! This was a stellar feast, thus my giving it  5 stars. If I could give it 10 or beyond I would!"
81,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful food, fantastic for dates – absolutely loved it. We went on a double date with friends and had the 5 course taster menu. Each course was delicious, well presented and great service."
82,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Casual atmosphere with an outstanding 7 course tasting menu. This is a three hour culinary experience. The wait staff is friendly and helpful. Put this on your list.
83,Daalder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Truly amazing food. Girlfriend wanted to surprise me, and yes she did! The food was very high end, the atmosphere cosy and relaxed, the personnel was delightfull. We had a great evening. Thank you so much..."
84,Daalder, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The food here is of a very high quality and for that reason almost easier to be more critical of. Choose between 4 and 7 course depending on your stomach capacity and all are inventive and delicious. A tuna tartar with dashi jelly and curry …
85,Daalder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,A really fantastic dining experience with no menu. Just choose how many courses you want between 4-7 and then sit back and enjoy in this friendly and relaxed environment. Totally recommended.
86,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Perfect! Delicious surprise menus in a cozy and friendly atmosphere. Highly recommend the wine pairings too. Can't wait to go back!
87,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"No worrie in the world, it is all been taken care off. Lunch/brunch at Easter Day 1. Weather is great. So cycling up there we wonder if there is a table available outside. No worrie, our table is waiting for us. Whithout asking. Great …"
88,Daalder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely dinner at this corner restaurant in Jordaan; Monk fish was to die for, same with the Cobia ceviche-like dish; take on the stroopwafel was also special. Deserves the 5 stars"
89,Daalder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Thoughtful and surprising and delicious. Very affordable given the high quality of the food. Attentive service.  Relaxed atmosphere on a nice neighborhood corner. All in all, a perfect place to enjoy good food."

92,Daalder, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Amazing food and not expensive compared with similar in London. Important to know the menu is unknown when you order, but amazing surprises await. Cater for dietary restrictions too."
93,Daalder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I've been here twice now and it does not disappoint. Professional and friendly service and course after course of surprising and tasty dishes, textures and ingredients. Not pretentious at all. Highly recommend."
94,Daalder, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Opinions are so positive i am finally marking 3***. I mean, what is the goal of the chef?

98,Daalder, 1 star ,a year ago,"Start working for them at one event ,after i decoder to terminate and they didn't pay me till I ask about my money and guess what?5 day of work ,9 hours a day they send me 250 euro....I'm not use to beg money around,I alwasy be on time and professional but apparently they are not ,I hope they get rich with this cheap behaviour."

101,Daalder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is fantastic but the informal environment is not for everyone. Cramped, bit too dark, music too loud, etc. Best seats perhaps at the bar..."
