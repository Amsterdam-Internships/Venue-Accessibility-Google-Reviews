0,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Tasty! But, as most cases in Amsterdam - the portions of the bagel is quite small and the price is high... At least add some vegetables on the side or add a small drink, guys! If it were ‚Ç¨2-‚Ç¨3 cheaper, I'd eat there regularly."
1,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Nice place for small meetings or reading with coffee or tea. I tried a Bagels a couple of times; the taste was nice and fresh.
2,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place for breakfast and lunch. Bagels are very fresh and all the ingredients are good quality. The service is quite fast compared to other Dutch bars. Ideal for a quite lunch bite. Prices are avarage Amsterdam prices.
3,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely atmosphere, has outdoor seating.  Food and drink quality is great, prices are very reasonable.  Service was friendly and fast. Convenient location for local offices."
4,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff and nice shpere. Kaneel bagel is definately recomended. Milky oolong tea is also nice and unique
5,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside bagels. Also available as a sandwich. Can choose salads as well. Massive cappuccino hahaha. Lots of options to grab and go or sit and enjoy. A very nice and consistent chain.

8,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff and delicious bagels as usual! Came here 2 days in a row during my stay in Amsterdam .
9,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The food got worse. They now put less stuff and cream cheese. So you eat almost bread only. Before the corona, it was a great place with delicious food. And they have no more date cake.
Sanitary  conditions I think not good also."
10,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is one of my favorite B&B stores because it's spacious and light. There's also a parking lot nearby. And the food is great as always!

15,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place, friendly staff, good service"
16,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice bagels! Good drinks too. On sunny days it is really nice to sit outside. They also have a lot of space inside to work and they don‚Äôt mind you working there. Not the friendliest service though.
17,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is good and the place is spacious. They have a high chair if you want to bring your child and also lots of space for strollers. However, they are pretty slow. I come here frequently and often wait 20 minutes or more for food, which ‚Ä¶"

20,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We discovered this place on our second day in Amsterdam and we absolutely loved it .Fresh, tasty food, delicious teas, great outside seating area to enjoy the weather. The best part of our visits to Bagels and Beans was our server Avie. She ‚Ä¶"

22,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An absolute delight. Bookended our holiday with it. Excellent food, good cup of coffee, lovely friendly staff and a chilled out atmosphere. Pretty good value for the area as well. Would reccomend in place of the breakfasts at the surrounding hotels"
23,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very child friendly place if you want to visit with kids. Thanks to large interior, young kids enjoy walking around. Also it is not crowded in general so perfect office if you need to work."
24,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice healthy bagels. The service is really really slow though. It can sometimes takes more than 30 minutes to get served here. If your keep that in mind it's really great. The food is fresh made and you can really taste it. There is payed parking though, 3 Euro per hour of you come by car. Otherwise Amsterdam Rai is really close by."
25,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice lunchroom with fresh biological products. Bit expensive for what you get though. Good place to do some work enjoying a coffee without being bothered to much. It's Amsterdam so be prepared to be served in English. Dutch probably will be the second choice.
26,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, nice atmosphere."
27,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff and nice set up, but chronically understaffed, tables sit there with uncleared dirty dishes for a very long time (20 minutes or more) also service is slow (waited 10 mins for food), and it wasn‚Äôt even peak hour. The place is ‚Ä¶"
28,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Long waiting line, the waitresses are either inexperienced or always frowning (if you don't like your job, just quit), the way owners include themselves in the business is weird and unprofessional.

36,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"A mix between a cafe and a sandwich place, I feel like Bagels & Beans is struggling to have an identity.  It's not warm and comfortable like a cafe, but it's not fast food like I'd expect from a sandwich shop. ‚Ä¶"
37,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Uber delivery packing is bad, bagels are not wrapped, they are flying inside the boxes so they come smashed wet and cold"
38,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,The place is very neat and cozy. But waiting almost 20 minutes for a coffee and a bagel in an almost empty place is not acceptable. And it has happened more than once. Awful service.

44,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Don‚Äôt go here if you‚Äôre really hungry. Only choose this place if you have about 3 hours to wait for a bagel. They get your order wrong , get you the wrong bagel, pitiful drinks. Just nope!"
