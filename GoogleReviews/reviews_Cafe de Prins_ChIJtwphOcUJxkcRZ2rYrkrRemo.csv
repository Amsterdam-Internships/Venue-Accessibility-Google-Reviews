0,Cafe de Prins, 5 stars ,5 months ago,A great food for a good price and staff is friendly. I recommend it here.
1,Cafe de Prins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh, the Poffertjes. I would have a picture of them up here had we not eaten them so fast. This is a beautiful Jordaan spot though you probably can’t go wrong with any of the restaurants in the vicinity. But we were recommended this from …"
2,Cafe de Prins, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"Really nice place, shame about the service from the very short haired girl with big hoops. If you want someone to move out of your way maybe ask politely instead of insinuating that I have eyes at the back of my head."
3,Cafe de Prins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This cafe was recommended to us by our tour guide to find good Dutch food with regular locals. It was pretty good. We ordered the bitterballen, tomato soup, and cheese fondue. Everything came out perfectly cooked. The service wasn’t super attentive, so don’t go here for that. Go here for the food."
4,Cafe de Prins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I have been here a few times and it’s always great to come back! A really nice, down to earth restaurant with great bitterballen and cheese plate. The staff is nice and friendly."

10,Cafe de Prins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy place to grab a drink and a bite to eat. Try it out when you have some time to kick back and relax. Also right by the canals with a nice view.
