18,Rijsel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Pricey option and recommended for special occasions. Has a fantastic wine collection. Good service. Their prime rib stake is not to tongue and eyes both.

20,Rijsel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very plain and simple. I know they say that's their whole idea, but then it's just overpriced and overhyped for what you get. A bit more room between the tables would also be nice, but I guess it's mostly about making as much money as …"

34,Rijsel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the most authentic dining experiences I've found in Amsterdam. It's a typically French menu filled with classic mainly meat based dishes. This is the kind of place you come to sit till the early hours whilst enjoying multiple courses and at least one bottle of wine. Book in advance. Cool bathrooms too.
35,Rijsel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty food and the staff is really kind. There is not too much choice on the menu but the ones are diverse! So wether you are vegeterian, like fish or love meat, no problem there always something delightfull to pick!"
36,Rijsel, 1 star ,2 years ago,My wife and I got the worst food poisoning of our lives from their Hanger Steak. My wife only had a bite and got sick. I was bedridden for a day and a half. It’s been three days and we’re still not right...Delicious though!
37,Rijsel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Bread, butter, wine, salami, and service were excellent. Mussels were very good but slightly salty. My main course brill fish was slightly overcooked but lobster sauce served with the brill was delicious."
38,Rijsel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is slowly becoming my favorite in town. Very well prepared, tasty French food with a flemish twist, constant menu with changing day courses, excellent wines by the glass and friendly staff. Roast chicken is delicious."
39,Rijsel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Rotisserie spring chicken to die for! Great value set menu available (if you can still fit in desert after the starter and main then you are one hungry person). Excellent french cookery!
40,Rijsel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this place. We had a great evening there, with perfect wine, good food and very nice and professional staff. Time to go back soon!"
41,Rijsel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Oh my ! One of the best pieces of meat EVER. Thanks to my local colleagues, I was taken to this wine&meat restaurant, what a memory. Since then, I keep recommending it to all my French-meat-loving friends and so far, none were disappointed."
42,Rijsel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best restaurants in Amsterdam! Incredible setting, food, vibe. Service is always top notch and the wine suggestions are always correct."
43,Rijsel, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Rijsel servers an excellent menu every time I have visited here. It always fully booked and make sure you reserve well in advance. Staff is friendly and helpful. I don't like the acoustics of the place so much, its very hollow which for me makes it hard to hear what the people I'm whith are talking about."
44,Rijsel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I have been to this restaurant twice.  Once in 2014 and again a few days ago. It is by all means different.  Only open in the evening and not on weekends.  The atmosphere is great, the service professional, the food is perfect. It is an experience."
45,Rijsel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful experience, chicken was great, as well as all our other dishes, and we will not forget Stephanie’s amazing hospitality. Definitely worth stopping by if in Amsterdam."

49,Rijsel, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Taste over look. Prices are very good for what you're eating.
50,Rijsel, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"I think we were the only Americans in the place; not surprising since a Dutchman had recommended It -- a Dutchman, I must add, who really loves food.  The decor is high school cafeteria modern, with the ambience of a brasserie.  Every seat …"
51,Rijsel, 5 stars ,a year ago,Absolutely loved it!!! There is surprise from starter to dessert. Really highly recommend it even though it is not cheap.
