1,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We had an amazing experience at this restaurant. The food was super delicious, spicy and full of flavour. I especially loved the injera (savoury Ethiopian pancake), the best one I have found in the Netherlands until now. We also enjoyed the relaxed and cosy atmosphere and the lovely staff. 10/10, thank you so much!"
2,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Tasty food! Perfect if you are craving for a full meal. We got share platters, the no- chicken strips with BBQ were delicious. We also got dessert- brownies and a duct cake which was amazing. Prices are good overall for 3 platters, dessert and drinks was ‚Ç¨54.50 for two! A good value for money"
3,Mooshka, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Lovely looking place, polite staff, interesting menu.
Great place to go for a vegan bite. Excellent choices for kids and plenty ""junk food"" options on the menu."
4,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very recommended to order the kapsalon! Difficult to find the vegan version of this Dutch traditional meal, thank you for making it real for vegan people! Yummmmmm"
5,Mooshka, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"They had the best vegan fried chicken and Oreo milkshake I've ever had. You cannot tell it's vegan. I've craved good vegan fried chicken for 4 years. Thank you, chef and staff üëèüëèüëè"
6,Mooshka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"‚ÄúBB with Q‚Äù was really boring in both look and taste. For 13 euros I would have expected a bit more than some beans and vegetables to garnish.
The burger had way too much barbecue sauce but good consistency. ‚Ä¶"
7,Mooshka, 1 star ,6 months ago,"The food was okay, nothing special.  Unfortunately, not even that much good can be said about the service.  Not only was she moving in slow motion, but she was making fun of customers behind their backs.  You need to be more careful next ‚Ä¶"
8,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice restaurant where to eat homemade food. The business is run by two people that take the orders, cook and serve you. It may take a bit to be served during pick hour but is is worth the wait. ‚Ä¶"
9,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I'm not a vegan; but excellent, tasty food. I really enjoyed the injera, and the kapsalon looked and smelled good as well"
10,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome restaurant with very good vegan burgers, starters and desserts. I simply loved it. They also have meals, but I didn't try them. It's also not expensive for Amsterdam standards (10~15)."
11,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Super cosy, great food ranging from burgers to no-chicken waffles, and awesome dessert!"
12,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hands down the best (vegan) burgers I've ever eaten. Highly recommend. Also the desserts are yummy and the staff is very nice.
13,Mooshka, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Staff was slow, 2 different waiters who clearly didn't have experience
,  unorganized, and we ordered three dishes but 1 dish showed up. We had to order later when we found out that 2 dishes weren't even processed. We ordered again ‚Ä¶"
14,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I was pleasantly surprised. Just wauw! A M A Z I N G food! Definitely recommend! Its all freshly made. Everything is vegan and super tasty. It's a good thing I don't live in Amsterdam cause I would spend all my money here hehehe.
15,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely service, both main dishes we had were filling and had amazing flavours, the desserts were delicious, indulging and beautifully made. For drinks I highly recommend the Captain's Kambucha."
16,Mooshka, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very yummy vegan burgers! But wait is pretty long (we waited for around 45 minutes) as they are quite popular with deliveries, so come earlier if you want to have a quick bite!"
17,Mooshka, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The venue is quite small and tight. Great decor. Food is super flavorful and well executed! Definitely gives the nostalgic vegan versions of shakes and burgers!
18,Mooshka, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We were lucky to have a table without reservation, but you should make one to be sure. Delicious food and drinks!"
19,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent restaurant. Love the setup, the atmosphere and most of all the food. It's a very nice location in Amsterdam with a great walk towards Rembrandt Plein. The staff was very nice and the prices are very reasonable. Great experience!"
20,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The chicken burger was delicious, loved the house made coleslaw
First time I've had a vegan chicken burger and not at all disappointed & the loaded fries was seriously good. ‚Ä¶"
21,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I tried the Caribbean Burger, very great!!! And the garlic source tastes delicious! The service is very cool and friendly. We will come back!"
22,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Hands down my favourite vegan restaurant in Amsterdam! The food will blow your mind, especially the buffalo solider with its incredible blue cheese sauce. Have only done takeout because of the pandemic but the staff are friendly, service is ‚Ä¶"
23,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely loved this place! Super friendly staff, amazing food, enjoyable music and all in all a great experience. Our starter was a bit late, therefore we got another one for free, which was super kind, but not necessary. We were happy ‚Ä¶"
24,Mooshka, 5 stars ,11 months ago,You are on a city trip in Amsterdam and you are vegan? (also perfect for non-vegans) You HAVE to visit this place. The red velvet cake is sooo good. And all the other dishes too! Can't wait to eat there again.
25,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Friendly staff, great fries and the blue cheese dip that comes with the buffalo strips is amazing!!"
26,Mooshka, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Lovely venue and interesting menu.

27,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,29-11-2019 first vegan experience and i must say it was great. The food the taste was great. The ppl are great go out and support.
28,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A ma zing food. As someone who is not vegan, mainly because i can‚Äôt leave cheeseburgers out my diet yet (i know), I was truly amazed by this vegan cheeseburger. So sensational, I enjoyed every second of it. You get a generous amount of food, and its more than just a simple burger, its richly topped and it is delicious!!"
29,Mooshka, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Tasty food, lovely atmosphere. Definitely worth to visit more than once. Needs to be patient about service time, but the waiters in the end of day were so lovely."
30,Mooshka, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Sis @  the register could have warned me about the Buffalo strips and fries!!! Absolutely delicious! I'm from NY, and we looooove blue cheese with our wings + thick, salty 'steak' cut fries. Whew. The sauce and vegan blue cheese are everything! I'll deff be back for more when I'm feeling naughty ;-)"
31,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great experience eating at Mooshka! The staff are super friendly and accommodating, and the food is delicious. I have tried most of the menu this stage and love everything, especially the buffalo strips. The restaurant has a great vibe too. Couldn‚Äôt recommend eating here more!"

35,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The perfect place to eat amazing  meals. They have something for everyone here: burgers, milkshakes, ethiopian Injera, Surinamese roti, everything vegan, everything absolutely delicious. The service is excellent, the location is perfect, and the atmosphere is very cozy"
36,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, great location, friendly staff, great drinks selection and most importantly, amazing food. I've eaten here many times and I haven't eaten one dish that didn't make me smile. This place makes it so easy to be a vegan. Lots of different options and inspirations on the menu. Will continue to visit regularly."
37,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Everything was incredible. Nice people, nice music and awesome food!"
38,Mooshka, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, but service a bit on the slow side.  The food is definitely worth it though!"
39,Mooshka, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Everything we ordered met our expectations although the burgers are quite big/filling and none of us were able to finish our plate. I strongly recommend the bitterballs
40,Mooshka, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing food and 10 star service, will definitely come back üòç"
41,Mooshka, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Menu looked great, unfortunately we weren‚Äôt able to try it. There were three other groups seated when we arrived, so the staff were busy, but not overly so. We were seated and given menus, then ignored for 20 minutes. After waiting 15 ‚Ä¶"
42,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We're not vegan but we thoroughly enjoyed the food. The Caribbean burger was super tasty, as well as the milkshakes. Very good service, especially for Amsterdam standards :D"
43,Mooshka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Vegan burgers might not be very exciting but they do these very well! The staff is also friendly and attentive. Somewhat over price for what they offer, you are looking at 17-20‚Ç¨ for a burger and fries."
44,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"BEST VEGAN FOOD IN AMSTERDAM!!
Seriously. Soooo delicious!! Try the donuts!!!
And the staff is even nicer than the food! ‚Ä¶"
45,Mooshka, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My friend and I used to go to Mooshka very often when it was still at the former location. The service was very slow but the atmosphere was super enjoyable, the owners just adorable and the food wonderful so we'd always patiently wait and ‚Ä¶"
46,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We've been here several times to share Injera and a Carribean burger. Quality is consistent and delicious!! The sweet potatoes on the side are good too. This time we also had an amazing red lentilsoup as a starter. It was a big bowl filled ‚Ä¶
47,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This was a great an refreshing experience. The menu was explicitly very ""diverse and inclusive"" but in a very relaxed way. We had the ""Loaded fries"" and ""Roti masala"", and they were delicious. Especially because we already knew them (my ‚Ä¶"
48,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,Had a great experience-  the food was soulful and good - the milkshakes were incredible and the mixed drink was strong.  I never eat ‚Äúvegan ‚Äú. But the soul was evident and the food was worth a second visit.
49,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic food, wide selection, charming place. Thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here!"
50,Mooshka, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is incredible! The food was amazing and the lady who owns the place was so kind and helpful, she gave us some banana cake whilst we waited for the food to be made. We had a burger and the Ethiopian injera - both were so so good! homemade, hearty and lovely vegan food -  highly recommend! xx"
51,Mooshka, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We ordered via their website and had it home delivered. Delivery was really fast, half an hour or so. Food was really good too, the combination of being able to choose healthy options or junkfood really works well for us. ‚Ä¶"
52,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place ticked all the boxes from service, value for money and satisfaction. My friend and I ordered the burger menu and WOW it tasted AMAZING! The cheese, sauces and sweet potato fries blew my mind! Everything tasted fresh and the meal was super filling. I'd recommend anyone to com here if they are craving a burger VEGAN OR NOT!"
53,Mooshka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious. But we had to wait for a long time. And there were two guys they completely forgot about. They entered before us, but only ordered their starters when we had finished our main dish."
54,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We came for Lunch at Mooshka for the first time yesterday & we will definitely be coming back again! The milkshakes were amazing! :)  Welcoming, friendly and excellent service. Loved it!"
55,Mooshka, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great atmosphere, great food, beautiful places! Definitely recommend to go, eat and enjoy ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
56,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Was honestly the best place I've eaten on this trip to Amsterdam. Roti Wrap was full of spice and flavour, the cheesy chips likewise and the masala croquettes were the best thing I've eaten in a while. Service was excellent, staff so wonderful and friendly. Really enjoyed it"
57,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I've been going to Mooshka since they've opened their first restaurant. The food never fails me, and their hospitality is insanely good. If you are looking for good quality, wholesome vegan food, here it's where it's at!
Love you guys and best of luck <3"
58,Mooshka, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Mooshka has great food and great service! The couple that own the restaurant were so kind; we had a great time speaking with them. My boyfriend got the burger and loved it; I got the Ethiopian pancake-- it was amazing. So flavorful, and so much food! We will definitely be coming back to Mooshka the next time we are in Amsterdam."
59,Mooshka, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome. Delicious food, friendly staff, a great experience."
60,Mooshka, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good atmosphere. The food was very delicious. We tried the two kinds of burgers, both were great. The fries and the vegan mayo, which came with the burger were also really tasty. A really good place with tasty food and a nice vibe. Recommended."
61,Mooshka, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The staff kept rushing us to order, the guy seemed very unhappy about being our waiter hahaha. It used to be a very cosy and nice place with a living room kind of vibe. Now it's very ""ongezellig"" and for the price point not the best spot. There are many vegan restaurants in Amsterdam with better service, atmosphere and prices."
62,Mooshka, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It is obvious that they‚Äôve just opened the place and have no hospitaltiy experience. Our experience started warm bottle of rose wine. You‚Äôd expect the staff would have noticed that. Afterwards the waiter took our order, checked it but still ‚Ä¶"
63,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had the Injera and a Chocolate Milkshake. I am happy. Nice and polite people. Places like this make me wish to move here. If there were such beautiful locations in my hometown, that would be really great. ‚Ä¶"
64,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,We visited Mooshka on Saturday evening & in our opinion Mooshka is an example to other restaurants in Amsterdam of exactly what good service is! We were made to feel welcome from the moment we arrived & the waitress even made us an alcoholic milkshake that wasn't on the Menu! ;)
65,Mooshka, 1 star ,a year ago,"We called two times and neither calls were picked up, and we were never called back. We made a reservation online at 8pm (because it said 8pm was an available time slot) and got an email that that our reservation was ""waiting to be ‚Ä¶"
66,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best Vegan restaurant's I've been to! Amazing burgers and mylkshakes, and great variety with ethiopian, asian, cakes etc. (all equally delicious). Great vibe with welcoming staff, had a good laugh with them and they were very accommodating. I 100% recommend to all vegans and non-vegans alike."
67,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious and cool selection of vegan foods!
68,Mooshka, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went for lunch and loved the mediterranean  burger and nachos!  We split a vanilla donut which we had high hopes for, but it had pink frosting and tasted a bit stale.  But everything else was delicious!"
69,Mooshka, 5 stars ,a year ago,I like it :) need to try more food next time. thank you!
70,Mooshka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was ok. We were disappointed because they didn't have anymore chicken and waffles, and the food was ok tasting. Probably too pricey for quality. Also my food was literally served in a Tupperware... Burgers were kinda small. And we waited a looking time for the food to come out."
71,Mooshka, 1 star ,a year ago,Tried to eat here but was advised I could not as I was alone and that only tables of 2 or more were accepted ‚Äúbecause of corona‚Äù. Literally the opposite of the government is recommending. there was plenty of space available and the staff claims that this is their corona rule and kicked me out.
72,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice place. Service was great and the food was amazing
73,Mooshka, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Such a nice welcoming atmosphere for simple but delicious vegan food. We had the soup which was made with sweet potato, plantain and  casave.  Was so filling and warming.  I also had a strawberry milkshake that I'd return to the caf√© for on ‚Ä¶"
74,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic place. Staff was friendly and attentive. Food was great. Awesome tastes. Interior might not always be to everyones liking but it gave us a warm feeling. Definitely coming back.
75,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Whether you are vegan or not, the grub at Mooshka is first class. So tasty! We had the Caribbean burger and the injera. Staff every bit as friendly as other reviewers mentioned. We went on the hottest day of the year (decade) and after ‚Ä¶"
76,Mooshka, 1 star ,2 years ago,"TRIED eating here twice now. I placed a reservation through the website, got an e-mail they would contact me about a table. Never got contacted. When you call them, the phone rings a couple of times and you get a voice mail. This happened ‚Ä¶"
77,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Visiting from the U.S. Delicious meal. My husband and I shared the bitter balls, cheese stick special, no chicken wrap, and flaming seitan wrap. Would definitely recommend."
78,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always a treat at Mooshka!!!
Delicious Vegan food take-out with Caribbean and African flavours!

82,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Superb food! Can't believe I didn't know this place before: everything on the menu is vegan, but soooo tasty and for such good prices. The service was amazingly friendly and fast. Try the Ethiopian injera and banana bread: DELICIOUS! I rolled out of there afterwards... portions are very generous."
83,Mooshka, 1 star ,a year ago,"Boring food , small place,packed during corona, had food to share there a while ago,which was a plate of different Currys,served on a sour pancake ,which was terrible, the young girl working there had no clue what she was doing,lack of hospitality, we also orderd rum & ginger which took ages to arrive."

85,Mooshka, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Yummy food + cocktails, lovely staff!"
86,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Saying the food was ""good"" is an understatement. In times of the beyond meat hype this place shows what delicious self-made burgers should taste like. Hope to be back soon."
87,Mooshka, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Good service, great food, we loved it. Don't miss the lemon cheescake!"
88,Mooshka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and atmosphere. My only complaint is that it's kind of small‚ÄîI want to bring my whole family of 6 here but I can't! So thankful for this restaurant though.

96,Mooshka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My go-to place to order food when I want to spoil myself. Everything I have tried so far is good, but I usually return to the injera and masala croquettes, because I can no longer live without both."
