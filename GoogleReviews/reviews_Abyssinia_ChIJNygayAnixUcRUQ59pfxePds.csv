0,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The food and service was amazing. For drinks we had the banana and mango beer which was so good and for food we asked the server what he would recommend and it definitely didn't disappoint. We got to taste a little bit of everything and the vibe of the restaurant was also really nice. Definitely recommend!
1,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This is a very good Abyssinian restaurant at the Ceintuurbaan. You can have here a lot of traditional Abyssinian food. I had some very delcious vegeterian food and it was tasting wonderful.  the service is very kind and helpful. So it was a great joy for me. At all i will come again.
2,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,5 months ago,This is so far my favorite of the Ethiopian restaurants in the area (I have tried all but 1 in the vicinity). The portions are generous and the flavors and spice level are on point. The ambiance is comfortable and homey. I like that they ‚Ä¶

4,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was so delicious and better quality than most things you can find in Amsterdam! If you‚Äôre looking for a unique taste and surroundings near Centraal, this is the place to go! It was pretty quiet when we went on New Years Day, so I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶"
5,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,6 months ago,One of my favourites restaurants in Amsterdam. A different food experience (I am Spanish). Great food (consider that could be a bit spicy). Wonderful service. Amazing decoration. Nice prices. Truly recommend!!!

Highly recommended!"
10,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent atmosphere here and the staff is very nice. The food was tasty as well. We got lamb, chicken and beef. All cooked well and had a bit of spice to them, just the way we like it. Definitely an experience as well, highly recommend coming here."
11,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The place was perfect. Really good african taste! The staff was so friendly and happy that it made the experience even better. We had the shared vegetarian plate and the one with meat. Its a really good varity of flavors. Also the banana bear from a coconut is nice to try
12,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Well not my typical type of food sour pancake which i hope there is riceüòÑ but then the ambience and beer are really unique to experience plus not to forget youll eat here with your hand, no utensils allowedüòä so looks and feels like youre out of holland for adventure a bit for the night"
13,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Awesome place to go to if you're looking to try some different food. What made it even more worthwhile for us were the multiple vegan options on the menu. Very friendly people who work there as well. Would definitely recommend!
14,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious and authentic Ethiopian food for a reasonable price. A lot of varied choices on the menu. The decoration and ambience is very authentic and the waiters are extremely friendly and welcoming!

Loved the decor. Will definitely visit again!"
16,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I liked their design very much, the food was tasty and interesting at the same time in the good price range"
17,Abyssinia, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Taste is more accomodating of European guests than real Ethiopian tastes. Service is friendly and the decor is nice.
18,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really enjoyed the place. Took a lamb dish and a vegetarian dish with pumpkin. It was amazing.
19,Abyssinia, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Delicious Food and Amazing service ,Fair price"

21,Abyssinia, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Had a nice dinner with friendly waiter.
22,Abyssinia, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Tasty food - I had the national dish. Unlike a few comments here, I did not find that the portions were especially big: 2 meals are good for 2 people.
Positively surprised by the fruity beer served in a wood bowl.
Friendly staff, we had to wait quite a bit to get served though."
23,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious food. Have been going there with my partner for the past two years! The staff knows how to prepare the best dish for you. Just ask them for help üí™üèº
24,Abyssinia, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Really cool place, and concept! Go there with a couple of friends, order a couple of different dishes, and you'll get your order on a big plate, placed in the middle so you and your friends can share :) Dig in with your hands and enjoy! I'd ‚Ä¶"
25,Abyssinia, 3 stars ,a year ago,"They have craft beer based on native Tigray recipe, and great interior but food is better around the corner in another Abyssinian restaurant."
26,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Ethiopian in Amsterdam, always service with a smile and plenty vegetarian and vegan options"
27,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved the food, but be aware, no cutlery here :)"
28,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very original concept. Lets you meet a little bit more of the culture with the deliscious food they have. Staff is very friendly and service is fast. You should try the mango beer.
29,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great atmosphere, staff is nice!  I especially loved enjerra zigni, my friend loved the banana beer. One of the best Ethiopian restaurants in The Netherlands."
30,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fantastic food and a completely different culinary experience. Staff were friendly and made good recommendations on the food to try because our group had not been before. It was delicious.
31,Abyssinia, 1 star ,5 years ago,"horrible service, meat gryssly and little flavor. No napkins. Nothing original about the flavour. When we said the meat was chewy, first we got ignored for 15 minutes and than when we left and suggested to take the meat of the bill the ‚Ä¶"
32,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Every time I visit, we try to eat here. I do not understand the bad ratings, probably they do not understand how true ethiopian foon is served and eaten? We always are 4 or more people. Excellent taste, excellent experience, sharing is the ‚Ä¶"
33,Abyssinia, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice Ethiopian food but staff was not very interested, mainly on their phones and the music was loud. Food was tasty, but you have to eat Ethiopian food with your hands, mine smelled like the enjeera the rest of the day no matter how much I washed them."
34,Abyssinia, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Quite pleased with this restaurant. The flavours are amazing and the staff is very friendly. Certainly one of the better Ethiopian spots in Amsterdam at a good price.
35,Abyssinia, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Not a child friendly place. We had to leave, as the waiter ignored us pointedly and complained that our 1.5 year old did not stay in her seat. Better Ethiopian restaurants with real ethiopian hospitality are not far from Abyssinia."
36,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly staff, delicious food and nice atmosphere, all at an affordable price and in a rather central location. I highly recommend this place !!"
37,Abyssinia, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good African food. Service is friendly and fast, prices are honest. Would recommend."
