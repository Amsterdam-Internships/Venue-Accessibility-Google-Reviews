23,H. Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food and friendly staff!!  Best veggie burger I've ever had. The sweet potato and regular fries were both excellent.  And they were more than accommodating to make a choc/PB shake for my birthday boy - so tasty.  Highly, highly recommended!"
24,H. Burger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cool burgers! The veggie burger is especially good compared to other burger restaurant. Unfortunately I don't think this one would be our ""go to"" burger restaurant, like it's good but not incrediblamazing...Still a good option though!"

Staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. ‚Ä¶"
33,H. Burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic! This place does amazing fries, burgers, and wings.  And all for reasonable prices.  Wings had a hot BBQ style sauce.

39,H. Burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really tasty burgers and amazing milkshakes! I really liked the experience, though by now it's not the most original concept anymore. This hip burger restaurant checks all the boxes a hipster burger bar should. Including a high price tag. ‚Ä¶"
40,H. Burger, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place is none like any burger place in Amsterdam. Their burgers are consistently of the best quality and taste. I make sure that any guest to Amsterdam I‚Äôm hosting visits H.  Burger.

43,H. Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly staff and delicious burgers!
44,H. Burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best food money can buy. Period. The veggie burger is honestly mind blowing. I've been told by several American friends that the meat burgers are hands down the best they've had in Holland. Spot on delicious sides. Homemade condiments. Cheesecake to die for. Genuine milkshakes. This place is a gem!
45,H. Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"H Burger has consistently amazing burgers, cooked to perfection, fries are crispy and delicious and the staff is very friendly. I go there at least 4 times a month. Definitely recommend!!"
46,H. Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Easily the best vegetarian burger I ever had. Make sure to try this place! Run by very friendly people. They don't serve beer but have a fantastic assortment of soft drinks to compensate.

50,H. Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Worth a try. The staff is so sweet, the bun combines so well the burger and ingredients taste is so good that the simplest burger is a pleasure. If you crave for a burger this is the place to stop by."
51,H. Burger, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"They have the best sweet potato fries i have ever eat, i love them"
52,H. Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's so simple and yet so good that I would call it the iPhone of the burgers.

Nice location, feels very warm and clean. ‚Ä¶"
53,H. Burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the wagyu burger, the bun and the meat was good. Why not 5 stars? I think for the price of the burger (probably the most expensive by default), the topping and the sauce could be more interesting as in adding more flavor profiles. The wagyu's juicy fattyness dominated the burger a bit too much."
54,H. Burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I just had strawberry milkshake and thick fries and they were Amazing!!! The shake is super dense but not to sugary. Best shake ever. Plzzz just order it!!!! And staffs are really friendly. Bit pricy but I will definitely come back.
55,H. Burger, 5 stars ,a year ago,The staff is always very welcoming and friendly. Best vegeterian burger I‚Äôve had so far with very tasty brioche bun.
56,H. Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food and really friendly service! The ketchup is clearly home made and tastes very fresh! The cheeseburger was dripping with cheese! And tasted great!!
57,H. Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good burgers and you can double them for cheap which is great for big eaters like myself. The milkshakes are absolutely amazing though. The stuff of high caloric legends.
58,H. Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Burgers are Top quality. The prices are good and the Burgers definitely filling
(I can eat). ‚Ä¶"

60,H. Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best burger in town! Nice looking restaurant, great athmosphere, cool people and delicious burgers! Don't forget to order the cheesecake as dessert :-)"
61,H. Burger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The cheeseburger and chocolate milkshake both really good. I was not a fan of the lemon cake as it was too sweet to my liking, hence, was not worth 5 euro for the dessert."
62,H. Burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice Burger, wings, fries and milk shake by candlelight..:)"
63,H. Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Burgers were fantastic, fries were brilliant, milkshakes were the best we‚Äôve ever had and we have had many. The service from both chefs and waiters was excellent."
64,H. Burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Possibly the BEST BURGER in Amsterdam or I will dare say Europe! The burgers are super awesome and the fries are great with homemade mayo and ketchup. Milkshakes and groovey  beverages as they dont have a liquor license. Worth a visit  to Oud-West if you love burgers.
65,H. Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a quite nice little restaurant with everthing you need. All the meals are organic, homemade and delicious. For the desserts I recommend the apple nut cake. The best apple cake I ever eaten."

Have tried almost all Burger places in town but no one beats H. Burger.
The staff is just amazing and the Burgers and fries are incredibly delicious."
67,H. Burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"By far the Best burgerjoint in Amsterdam. Some competitors claim to be The Best Burger in Town, but H.Burger IS The Best Burger in Town.
