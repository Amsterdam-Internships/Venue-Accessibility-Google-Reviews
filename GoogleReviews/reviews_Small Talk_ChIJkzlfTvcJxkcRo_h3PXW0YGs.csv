0,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"This turned out to be a pleasant breakfast spot. Wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect, but we were hungry and needing a spot along our walk to the museums. When we popped in, the service was a little cold at first, but eventually warmed up and ‚Ä¶"
1,Small Talk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We ordered an omelette and a burger for breakfast, all arrived very fast. Very good quality of products. We had also orange juice and coffee.
Excellent service"
2,Small Talk, 1 star ,a month ago,"This is the worst costumer service I have ever encountered. First they say something is fine, then they changed their mind and decided we had to leave, and threw us out. Without any warning. We did everything by the book, so unless you are ‚Ä¶"
3,Small Talk, 1 star ,a month ago,"Been there twice and one of the most horrible customer service I have ever experienced. This place has a restaurant and a coffee bar and both have an owner, who is rude, yelling and customers (not only me but also others around him) where ‚Ä¶"
4,Small Talk, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"I ordered ‚Äú2 slices of bread with ham or cheese and garnish‚Äù, and i got two white toast with cheese and ham on it (cold) for the price 9.50 euro. I expected a nice bread not a plain white toast and with melted cheese. The salad was the only good thing about it. But i do not recommend the order i ordered."
5,Small Talk, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"service was poor, a bit rude and rushed. Ordered salmon baguette and got salmon in a cheap burger bun."
6,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It reminds me of a pub. So, there is a very nice atmosphere. The staff is very accommodating and pleasant. Food is also recommendable. We had salmon and a grilled mix fish plate. Unfortunately, there is no local beer."
7,Small Talk, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Cozy place but closes too early, at 21h everyone out‚Ä¶"
8,Small Talk, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Tasty soups, delicious apple pie. Full stop.
We asked for extra bread for the soup and the young lady told us with a rude manner that she was too busy to bring us... That's the reason for the two stars"
9,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"WS there on Sat.4th Dec.21. Really friendly staff, and what must be the best Apple Pie and cream in 'Mokum' The coffee was also beautiful. Highly recommended the place."
10,Small Talk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really nice waiters and good food!
11,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This pancake restaurant stands on the busy corner near the Museum Square. You can have a delicious pancake and tasty coffee at a outside table, with a lot of bikes, cars, buses, trams and commercial trucks passing by right in front of you, ‚Ä¶"

16,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had the best duck in the world here during my stay in Amsterdam. The staff were super kind and accommodating. Really enjoyed the overall atmosphere.
17,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful cafe right next to the modern art museum and Van Gogh Museum. Was a little hesitant due to its proximity to tourist attractions but the food was superb! Even my kids who are normally picky eaters internationally loved this place! 5 Stars
18,Small Talk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Cosy. Comfortable. Maybe the concept of a hamburger isn't clear. Lasagne microwaved and not edible.
19,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice, good Dutch food and beer. Great place to eat and relax.

Brown shrimp were great."
20,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Small cozy place to have food and coffee for small talk. Great street views from the ground floor and first floor. However, It was difficult to manage kids in the small place."
21,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice little coffee shop with loads of different levels and sections to sit in.
22,Small Talk, 1 star ,5 months ago,"As tourist, you can order hamburger fries to take away for 7‚Ç¨50, an you will receive hamburger without fries, and they will ask you 8‚Ç¨95 !
Welcome !"
23,Small Talk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,No alt milk. Black bitter good though. Ambience is pretty interesting although little refurbishment might be planned. Cool mirror in upstair toilet ‚ò∫
24,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Mediocre food, terrible coffee (didn't even finish it), not good service either. They should make more of an effort."
25,Small Talk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Friendly staff with genuine Amsterdam style banter. Good food at reasonable prices for the area, a great stop for a quick bite and a few drinks."
26,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,I am sure that this is just a canned soup. Just stay away from this place. Prices are high and food is terrible.
27,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Slightly expensive. Great Croissants and decent coffee. Nice location and good ambiance.
28,Small Talk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly service - amazing hot chocolate! Get the whipped cream!

33,Small Talk, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very kind staff! Good for chat and meeting!
34,Small Talk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was delicious, and the service was good though it was very crowded.
My only concern is that the restaurant itself is small and u cant sit comfortably."
35,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit expensive and a bit too small. But, it's Small Talk :D
I enjoyed my lunch. It was very tasteful and the people there are nice.

36,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Affordable, ok pub food, nice staff."
37,Small Talk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Great location, nice ambience but... prices are very high compared to the quality of the food. The service was slow (50 minutes for a hamburger)"

40,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The onion soup was outstanding and the chicken in peanut sauce was excellent. The service was perfect. Our waiter was a delight. Left us with a fabulous memory of our stay in Amsterdam. We will be back!
41,Small Talk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great little cozy place to have a coffee or grab some food.
42,Small Talk, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"They should practice customer service, that old lady should have manners. You don't come with attitude to a customer ma'am. I don't think il ever buy from your shop again."
43,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect. We enjoyed Dutch classics,  a pancake and an ""uitsmijter"" which happens to be beef (or ham, or cheese) with fried eggs.
Not overpriced,  a nice and busy place,  where you can relax after your museum visit across the street.  Nice staff,  very Amsterdam's."
44,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place for American tourists.  Menu is in English, explains all ingredients clearly.  Good local beer on tap.  Good dutch bar food.  Service was great even in the rush hours.  Staffs were so friendly and accommodating.  If you need a quick bite in between museums, this is a must stop."
45,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly and has a lovely feel. Only had a coffee and a tea but it was very nice.
46,Small Talk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place for a quick lunch. Great food and service.

48,Small Talk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved the atmosphere, food was great, and the waiter was super helpful and fun !"
49,Small Talk, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"We went here without looking at any reviews and the food was decent. We got the peppered steak, lobster bisque (amazing!), and lasagna. It was home cooked style which can be nice when you've been traveling for a while. I would say the food ‚Ä¶"

51,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,extortionate prices.  we ran in to have a drink while we waited for the rain to pass. we paid nearly 20 euro for 2 shots of baileys. had i known it would be this much we wouldnt have even sat down but im guessing this is how they make their money. the staff where very friendly but  it doesnt make up for this level of overcharging.
52,Small Talk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A wonderful place to hangout on a weekend morning. The view of the alley from inside the cafe is beautiful. The service deserves a big applaud. They are fast, very kind and always lightens one up with their authentic smiles. Loved it and would highly recommend the Cafe Noir experience."
53,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, seems like there are many locals. Good sign!"
54,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,Waited for 10 minutes before I went to staff to take my order and then they messed it up anyways - exactly the same situation with the asking for the bill. I am confident to say that during my visit the waiting staff has never even glanced ‚Ä¶
55,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a cute and convenient cafe to stop by for drinks and food while you're in the Museum quarter. The prices are moderately expensive but after a day of exploring museums, you'll welcome the nice portions."
56,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Small Talk is simply a small, friendly, intimate cafe where you can sit down and enjoy a Dutch moment.  I had a Mochacino and it was delightful.  It was served hot, with a nice, fluffy froth, and raw sugar on the side. The Apple strudel looked really good, but I didn't get a chance to try it."
57,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I don't know what was worse, the food or the service. Absolutely horrible experience. The older waitress ignored us and served the 2 other locals dining at the 2 tables near us. She never came by to ask if we needed anything. And they ‚Ä¶"

60,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Disgusting food, terrible waiters who have ignored us for 35 minutes (despite the fact that I asked them twice if they could take my order). Would have left, but it was raining heavily, so I was basically captured there. Regarding the food, ‚Ä¶"
61,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worst restaurant experience in Amsterdam. Don't get me wrong, I live here and I mean it. The old chubby server was absolutely rude and misbehaved to the customers. Maybe he has too much food in his belly so he doesn't need extra money from the business."
62,Small Talk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Our visit here can easily be summarised by a comment we overheard several times on our visit - Disappointing. The menu is technically correct I suppose - we ordered the Krokets with bread and they came as two small croquettes just dropped ‚Ä¶
63,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Prompt service by friendly multilingual staff.  I had the mixed seafood grill, which was delicious, and a generous portion for the price. I would recommend it to anyone in the museum district."
64,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Extremely Poor Customer Service.
Waited so long for our food and we had to ask twice for our drinks to be ordered again after our food came. ‚Ä¶"
65,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible customer service, the waitresses yell at you in poor English, tell customers to change table to increase turnover and optimize paid seats.
Food is also overpriced but that would otherwise be okay if the waitresses ‚Ä¶"
66,Small Talk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good food. Small and crowded place
67,Small Talk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Cosy, friendly coffee shop...if you're shopping in the Van Baarle Straat,  also a great place for a bathroom break and watch the shopper's pass by."
68,Small Talk, 5 stars ,a month ago,Cool
69,Small Talk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice local place near the museums. Friendly staff, good drinks, comfort food is always good. Have gone here often and have not had any issues, only a good meal at a fair price for a tourist area."
70,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome! Waiters are funny and ready for any of your request. We were in a hurry, so they brought us food quickly, but still it was delicious! Highly recommended"
71,Small Talk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Our waiter had probably worked here for 40+ years. Loved him, plenty of humour and good food too. I had tomato soup and apple pancake Dutch style. Delicious!"
72,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,Tourist prices but small basic versions of meals provided. Dutch specialisties were done poorly eg croquette were attached to supermarket bread with a dash of butter and sold at ‚Ç¨9.95. Was pressured to tip. Would not recommend. Disappointing (view mentioned serveral times in many languages by other visitors)
73,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Quick service and delicious crepes. Perfect place for a quick bite to eat!
74,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,I don't know what is wrong with their staff and their attitude to foreigners. We came in the morning to have breakfast and instead we've got cold greasy pancakes and arrogant waitress. I had a feeling of being in jail! We've been trying to be nice till the end but it seemed to be making her even more resentful and rude.
75,Small Talk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I was here for just a black coffee and croissant, and I was happy I didn't come for more. The waiter didn't pay any attention, I got the wrong drink from another table and had to swap the drinks with that table by myself. Not a place to have a drink and relax."
76,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very nice coffee and lunch spot with friendly staff. The older man in charge (manager, owner?) groped me while I was standing at the register ordering. Disgusted that the restaurant‚Äôs management treats women this way."
77,Small Talk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice little coffee house with a good breakfast and lunch menu in an excellent location just around the Stedelijk Museum. Staff are atypically for this area quite over 25 and perhaps therefore evermore so efficient. Friendly, fast and funny. Not unimportantly: Good food too."
78,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A friendly and fast corner bistro to drop by and have a drink or two. Various choices of snacks and meals. We had for example a selection of cheeses and a selection of bitterballen (7 and 8 euros). Enough for several persons. Although there could have been larger assortment of cheeses (soft ones e.g.).
79,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We have had breakfast here plenty of times over the years never had any issues always friendly fresh an tasty big our last visit wasn‚Äôt great , the French onion soup was still very good but it was probably a mistake to order steak here ."
80,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"After ordering two coffees I was forced to leave this establishment after only 25 mins of sitting there and using my laptop - after I enquired why I was being forced to leave as all the chairs near me were empty I was told ""this is not an office and I have already stayed for half an hour."" Extremely rude and moreover subpar coffee."

82,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Very cute
83,Small Talk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not personally my favorite place. This is a place that generally the older crowd goes to after the museum tours. The French onion soup is good, but that's about it. Service is friendly, but the view isn't all it seems because their is very ‚Ä¶"
84,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Went there and sat and waited to get served. Meanwhile the waitresses looked everywhere but our table; we felt invisible. When we complained about the service, the waitress was smug and condescending. I agree with other reviewers on here. Terrible service,  staff with bad attitudes and overpriced food. Avoid this place at all costs."
85,Small Talk, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great place to grab a simple breakfast. Food was quick, good, and average price. We were not in any rush so a bit of waiting for service was just fine. Love the cosy atmosphere."
86,Small Talk, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Just ordered 120euros worth of food and ask: ""excuse me, could my aunt have a glass of warm water please?"". Waitress: ""No. You can only order tea."". Me: ""Eh... Ok... Maybe just a glass of cold water then?"" Waitress: ""No. If you want water, ‚Ä¶"
87,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Awful food, terrible service, don't go here"
88,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to drop in for an early evening drink, with cosy upstairs seating. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to try the food as was heading for a flight, but friendly and welcoming staff make you want to stick around."
89,Small Talk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The pancakes ist just one pancake and really expensive. 8.90‚Ç¨ for a single pancake without topping.
But the view an seating position is great."
90,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy, casual American diner-type of place with a really nice, fun and engaging staff."
91,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Spacious, a little pricy,  but a wonderful place to visit. There's lots of seating available, and even slightly bigger groups of around 8 can find a place. The staff are also friendly, and talkative, and make great recommendations!"
92,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy, nice staff, great view from upstairs and delicious pancakes with banana."
93,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We ordered 2 steak and all cold. The lobster soup, I couldn't find any lobster, only flour crab stick, it costed 11 eur. Very bad experience"
94,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely stuff, food very delicious!"
95,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst  meal we've had in Amsterdam! And incredibly expensive for the offer! Avoid!
If you have no other option for eating, better buy something from Albert Heijn supermarket nearby!üòÅ"
96,Small Talk, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Horrible customer service: the cafe says ""Small talk"" but the lady staff working there has big mouth. Me and wife went to have cup of coffee and when we going up to take a sit. The lady working behing the counter shouted ""sit down""..we said ‚Ä¶"
97,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really disappointed as it‚Äôs my birthday and I‚Äôve come here for breakfast and I have been treated really badly, the waiter old  lady with glasses was just so rude!! But I‚Äôm not going to let her spoil my day!! She said They had nothing left on the menu! Which is bull because it‚Äôs breakfast time!!!"
98,Small Talk, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice British pub atmosphere in Amsterdam.
99,Small Talk, 1 star ,5 years ago,The food is absolutely awful. It's obviously not fresh and not prepared properly. The interior is worn and dirty. Yet the prices suggest it should be top notch. Definitely overpriced. I suggest looking for a different restaurant in the area.
100,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place to stop, coffee was very good at a reasonable price. Service was excellent. Brilliant atmosphere inside."
101,Small Talk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"A cozy place in a great location with friendly staff. The food was quite pricey and not good, as was the coffee. It was over 8 euro for what turned out to be only a cup of goulash soup. Would not go back."
102,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super cozy, great place to have some coffee before or after you visit one of the museums nearby. Friendly staff, coffee's all right, what else do you need?"
103,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful little cafe. Had breakfast of coffee and crepes which was very tasty. Staff were friendly and service was quick.
104,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Not spectacular but good food for a fair price. Nice wines and special Jopen beers. And the waiters are the cherry on the cake. So funny.
105,Small Talk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly staff but food is barely eatable amd expensive :(
106,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good place. Nothing incredible but... good.
107,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pancakes delicious. Very attentive friendly staff and swift service. Lots of chairs and great large mints
108,Small Talk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice location and cosy place, but the coffee is not great. Also, they did not want to serve us tap water and sold us a 250 ml bottle for almost 3‚Ç¨!"
109,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Food was average at best. Service was atrocious. No amount of 'please', 'thank you', and smiles by me to the older male server made any difference. He looked at me and treated me like I was scum. I hope he's the owner as no service employee would ever in their right mind act like that."
110,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had a omelet with veggies added ham. One of the best breakfasts I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam. Coffee was delicious as well. Recommended !
111,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fun and very friendly. The food is quite ordinary but edible & its a good place to stop and watch the world go by for a while.
112,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Our favourite pub before visiting one of the museums or the Concertgebouw. Nice meals and coffee. Very friendly staff.
113,Small Talk, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Chanced upon the cafe after visiting the Van Gogh museum mid morning. Ordered cappuccino - too frothy, too little coffee. But bacon pancake put me back on track to being a serious tourist :) Waiter was kind - kept asking/saying 'OK?' every time he placed something on my table. Nice touch ;)"
114,Small Talk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great restaurant! Great location, absolutely delicious food, fast and friendly service! I would really recommend this one if you are nearby"
115,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My dog's rates this caf√© 5*s! They gave him a little bit of roast beef and didn't mind him being muddy. üê∂üòä
116,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We had a really fulfilling meal in the museum area. It's really worth it. Even a whole spectrum of vegeterian dishes which were delicious.
117,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,Rude women inside with attitude. I went in and she didn't even say hello and said she's too busy to serve. To be honest she was probably stressed as she was on her own. Get more staff!
118,Small Talk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The grill chef was spot -on with the rare entrec√¥t aux poivres! Not sure why anyone is complaining about the service, we are here July 31st at lunch time and everything was great :-)"
119,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty simple Dutch food, with friendly service and a unique atmosphere. Rather on the expensive side for what it is, but hey this is museum street!"
120,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Staying at a nearby hotel and came here several days in a row for breakfast. The staff are really friendly and the pancakes are delicious.
121,Small Talk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious food and a great location.
122,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,Really rude waiter. When the cafeter√≠a is completely empty was obliging us to take a second drink or either kicking us out after paying for our initial drinks
123,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The waitress was really rude. She also made all of us order something when, out of seven, only five of us wanted just a coffee."
124,Small Talk, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Shocking how terrible their customer service was. Grumpy, ungrateful staff and the food isn't much better. Low quality, bland tasting food but also overpriced. Heard one of the staff laugh maliciously at another customers tip. Avoid!"
125,Small Talk, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Overpriced for coffee, better coffee across the street"
126,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst place I have ever been. The food is extremely overpriced and tastes realy bad. Also the staff is rude and dont care about clients at all.
127,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Really bad service... The stuff was very rude, making inappropriate jokes and later even ignoring us. I advise to avoid this place. Food was mediocre."
128,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible and rude waiters. We were there for something about 15 min, a couple came after us, the waiter came, took their order and left without even looking at us and we left the restaurant."
129,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic place for brunch as was our experience. If you are headed to the musuem district recommend eating here.
130,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The service is nice, but the food, menu and place is awesome. So roomy and cozy!!"

133,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent ambience and good food. Nice dutch atmosphere, would definitely recommend for tourists!"
134,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Didnt want to serve us two beers when everyone was having drinks. I guess young ""not wealthy""people are not well recieved. Go to the next place instead(pompa) much nicer people ;)."
135,Small Talk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,plesent quick food and service
136,Small Talk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Avoid this place!

Expensive but bad food... terrible service and rude staff. We made the mistake not to check via google before we went into this nightmare. Don't go there!"
137,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Perfect breakfast spot but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs good all day. Had the breakfast a√ßa√≠ bowl and it was delicious!
138,Small Talk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Just had a quick drink while we were waiting for the bus, needs a bit of a face lift and it looks like that's what they were doing so hopefully the next time we drop in it will be looking nice"
139,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Large menu, large portions, typical Dutcch food and linternational food. Fast service. Medium quality."
140,Small Talk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food and server was very pleasant. Great place to sit outside. Had the bacon pancake... Delicious
141,Small Talk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good IPA, but 9‚Ç¨ for a beer is just too much. Cosy place with good beer but prices are crazy."
142,Small Talk, 2 stars ,a year ago,Horrible coffee. 2 stars for the ambience and because the waitress was friendly enough.
143,Small Talk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Extortionate price, poor ingredients, poor service. Worst Amsterdam dining experience to date."

146,Small Talk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food here was very delicoise. And the prices was realy fair. The athmosphere was realy nice and a bit retro fitting to the City itself.
147,Small Talk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best Team in Townüëçüèº
148,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The lady that works here is rude. Saw her ""accidentally"" not give correct change to a tourist. Made fun of another. Overpriced as well. Go elsewhere"
149,Small Talk, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Great coffee and fast friendly service
150,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ordered crab salad. Beware it is not, I repeat not crab, but crabsticks. At least I didn't have to pay but it's a clear case of misleading punters"
151,Small Talk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Perfect service. They even provide on demand cheese which is not on the menu. Unfortunately they have German beer.
152,Small Talk, 1 star ,a year ago,The place smells super bad and one of the glasses of water we ordered had still some soap on it.
153,Small Talk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very disappointing. The place is good but you have to wait a long time. We were 4 persons and have to wait at least 30min for the main course, it's simply not possible! We'll never come back."
154,Small Talk, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Nice food and even nicer personel, making jokes and all. It was a pleasure to dine here. The special Dover Sole was perfect."
