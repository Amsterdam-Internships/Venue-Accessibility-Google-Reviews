0,Wau, 4 stars ,a month ago,This new restaurant is quite charming. I loved their outdoor seating area and their indoor dining area is cute too. We started off with the Bubble Trouble and Api-Api cocktails. Both very good. I loved the mango pearls in the sake cocktail â€¦
1,Wau, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Came for weeknight dinner on a holiday with a reservation. Itâ€™s a quaint and cozy place with a heated outdoor patio. Cocktails were unique and dishes were good. Overall, it was a nice experience and will come back when in the mood."
2,Wau, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Reply great food! Loved the appetizers here. We got the savory donuts and roti canai. Also got the nasi lemak which is a classic and that was delicious as well. The salty egg noodles were very interesting but good! The lobster was a bit â€¦

6,Wau, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Donâ€™t order Roasted Hainanese Chicken Rice, itâ€™s dry. And roasted. If youâ€™re gonna remix a classic dish, it better be amazing. Itâ€™s not. The Nasi Goreng was just ok. Itâ€™s pricey for what it is, average."
7,Wau, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Absolutely delighted that a Malaysian place has opened up in UWS. Tried the Roti Kanai, Murtabak for appetizers. Both were amazing. Next we tried Nasi Biryani with lamb which was okay. The lamb was well cooked but the Biryani needed more â€¦"
8,Wau, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"In the heart of upper east side. Corner spot stood out , with its outdoor setup and its rustic look. Walking in , it was dim and romantic with suede green chairs. Totally loved the ambiance of the locations. Now on to the food , we ordered â€¦"
9,Wau, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Beautiful interior design and most importantly, phenomenal food. Much needed addition to the UWS dining scene. Great spot for a night out with friends, (they have amazing cocktails!) or with the whole family. Kids friendly!"
10,Wau, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"The two stars were earned by this candy (see pic) for it's delish sweet and sour flavor.
We were a party of 4, a round of cocktails, 4 apps and 4 mains all shared. Not â€¦"

13,Wau, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I had an awesome experience dining at WAU. Right as I entered I loved the vibe of this restaurant, small cozy vibe with a twist of Malaysian aroma in the air.

15,Wau, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"What works well: service is very kind; food is fun; decor is lovely.
Suggestions: more modern and quieter music, maybe Southeast Asian music, either traditional or modern; donâ€™t promise booth then take it away for the reason that â€¦"
16,Wau, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Ordered drunken noodles for takeout but gave me pad see ew instead. Flavor is okay but over-priced.
17,Wau, 1 star ,3 months ago,"I have never written a bad review but I have no choice but to write one after how the staff made us feel. Staff was extremely rude to us. We were there for a dinner reservation at 8 30. From the moment we walked in, they kept rushing us to â€¦"
18,Wau, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I decided to try the Singapore Laksa because I've read so many amazing reviews about it. Let me tell YOU! It tasted so so good. I recommend everyone to try out this dish!
19,Wau, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Had dinner here and we were all impressed by the food. Rendang beef, pork belly and Chilean seabass were all very good."
20,Wau, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Iâ€™ve tried this restaurant 3 times. One at lunch, one for dinner and one takeout. Each time had a hit or miss element, I think theyâ€™re still getting their kinks worked out. And probably have some staffing improvements. â€¦"
21,Wau, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The menu is beautifully diverse in terms of south Asian food options. The flavors and spices were all there in authentic form. It was such a great experience.
22,Wau, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Excellent new addition to the Upper Westside restaurant scene.   Unique Asian dishes, including noodle, soup, and rice dishes.  Fresh ingredients, great flavors.   Friendly staff and a cool atmosphere inside.  Great bar."
23,Wau, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"I really don't get all the hype around this place. Firstly, the service was horrendous. After ordering we were approached by a different waiter asking to take our order, unaware anyone had already been waiting on us. The first waiter came â€¦"
24,Wau, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Visited on a friday night w/o a reservation and was offered bar seating. Canâ€™t speak to the cocktails (but i would go back just to have a drink-they look amazing). Ordered the Nasi Goreng & Rendang beef and enjoyed both, Portions were satisfying too. Definitely will try again."
25,Wau, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I had an amazing experience with them, one of the best Malaysian cuisines I've tried! The Soy Sauce Braised Pork Belly melted perfeclty in my tastebuds! Can't wait to bring my friends here."
26,Wau, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"So excited to have a Malaysian restaurant in the neighbourhood! We had roti canai, wonton dumplings, char kueh teow and nasi lemak. I think the nasi could have been more lemak but otherwise I felt the food was great and authentic. We will be back!"
27,Wau, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing first experience. My boyfriend and I couldn't figure out what we wanted to eat for lunch today, so we searched for restaurants near me, I saw WAU and the dishes sounded so delicious. We had to go in and try it out for ourselves.10/10 reccommend!!"
28,Wau, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious Malaysian food. Highly remmended. The Nasi Lemak was delicious. Malaysian cuisine is its own fusion style -- think Indian meets Chinese meets Thai. If you haven't had it you're missing out.
29,Wau, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"For appetizer, we shared the roti canai (the roti itself was nice and chewy, and the curry had great flavor).The cocktails (we got the Bubble Trouble and the Kaya Killer) were unique and quite easy to drink. The Kaya Killer is a bit â€¦"
30,Wau, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,This was an amazing dinner! The coconut was was surprisingly so amazing! Can't wait to go back.
31,Wau, 3 stars ,3 months ago,This place was disappointing. The lotus roots were delicious but the Rendang beef was kind of bitter and a little spicy. No other flavor. Same with the murtabak. Not much flavor. And itâ€™s all just too expensive
32,Wau, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I don't usually try new foods, but my friend recommended that I come here and try it out because she said the food tasted amazing! And guess what?! She was right! It tasted fantastic."
33,Wau, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I rarely write reviews but I had to after visiting WAU! Food was fantastic here, I would like to bring my parents next time to try because they love Maylasian cuisine. Give this place a try!"
34,Wau, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I've eaten everywhere UWS. Wau is an awesome edition to the options available. I highly suggest you just order something you have never heard of before. Everything is an explosion of flavor. You won't be sorry!

40,Wau, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Wau, these flavors!"
41,Wau, 1 star ,4 months ago,My wife and I were very exited to order some authentic Singaporean food. We spent 120$â€¦ Half of the food was cold and we did not get any rice. When we tried to call the restaurant we could not get a hold of anybody.
