0,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Very charming and cosy interior, smiling and helpful staff. It's a great place to stop by while walking through the city, and their pastries are actually really good. Would love a few more gluten free options on the menu, though but other than that, it's a very lovely break from city-walking."
1,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,We had a breakfast at this lovely place. The decoration is cute and charming. The pastries are handmade and tasty. Vegan and salty options are avaible too. Only a couple places on the main floor but some steep stairs lead to the tea room. ‚Ä¶
2,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I go here every trip to Amsterdam for lunch. Today, I had a five hour layover and made a special trip into the city center just to have sandwich here. The food, the service, the lovely little patio overlooking the canal‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs all perfect."
3,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Love the place, love the meal and love the  people who work there! üòä

4,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Rustic atmosphere, essential service, honest food (especially what‚Äôs baked on sight), laidback atmosphere. ‚Ä¶"
5,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Lovely place! First time trying a carrot cake and it was delicious üòä adorable interior
6,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,3 months ago,I felt in love with their store window. Full of baked goods with some vegan options and cozy decoration. The banana bread was really good!
7,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The place is worth waiting for. Food is authentic, more like a cafeteria and bar or tea room, so if you want to have a regular lunch not the right place. Staff is super kind after you win a table you‚Äôll have a very good time!"
8,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place for a nice brunch or a sandwich lunch. Incredibly friendly staff and a cute Amsterdam spot.
9,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a week ago,"It‚Äôs a cute little bakery, it‚Äôs looks like my grandmas home. Cute, pink and home-y
The prices are okay, because the food an d juices are all fresh made. You can even watch how they make your sandwichüëåüèº"
10,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,I had lunch here last week and the quiche Lorraine was the best I have ever tasted. The coffee was delicious too. Service was good and I will definately go back to sample some of the beautiful cakes.
11,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing bakery straight out of a fairly tale. Everything was delicious.
12,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Super cute place, amazing cakes and lovely staff! Must go. PS: try the french toast croissant."
13,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,a month ago,"When you bring your own cup to avoid waste, they use cardboard cups to serve you the coffee in your own cup. Then they throw the cardboard cup immediately. Not nice. Not ecological. + They ask you to pay 1‚Ç¨ for any small additional amount of milk in your coffee (while coffee is already expensive). Won‚Äôt come back."
14,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,a month ago,I used to love to go to this place but I must say It is not like how it used to be. What I personally didn't like and expect was the service. Very rude and couldn't be bothered to understand a bit of Dutch. The atmosphere is very chaotic as are the menu/prices.

16,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Little, cozy bakery. Their sandwiches, jams, brownies and banana bread are super delicious! Staff was helpful and kind. There is no large space for hang out. But we went early every morning and could find place."
17,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,De Laatste Kruimel is a local bakery found along Langebrugsteeg in central Amsterdam. Had a nice morning visit here for coffee and cake during a recent trip to the city. Opening hours are 8am to 8pm daily. ‚Ä¶
18,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"This place was not what I expected.

20,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a lot of delicious looking cakes to choose from. We had the vegan chocolate cake.. Mme mme beautiful. The strawberry and rhubarb crumble cake, again delicious and lemon and poppyseed cake which my daughter enjoyed but not too my taste"
21,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"We have been going to the L.K since September 2017. Somehow the quality of food and staff was better then. Now, you would be lucky to have someone take your order with a smile and some patience. Other than the one gentleman who works there, ‚Ä¶"
22,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I completely understand why it's called 'the last crumb'. Everything was delicious! I ordered the rhubarb and strawberry pie, the French toast, the goat cheese and, leek quiche,  each one was bite was better than the one before it; it was a ‚Ä¶"
23,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely place to have excellent pastries (scones, pies, cakes, cookies...) and a pleasant moment. Waiters are very nice.
I do recommend!"
24,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Lovely bakery. The scenery in the bakery with the oven and the freshly baked pastries alone makes the visit worth it. We had the vegetarian sandwich, french toast and pasta de nata. All of these were exceptionally good and would highly ‚Ä¶"
25,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoyed this little cozy tug away cafe by the water. Very fresh bakery & delis with some vegan baked goodies.  Just a note, there is no restroom at this place."
26,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Cute and cozy place with attention to detail. Food was delicious and worth the price and there are many options. The cherry on top of the whole experience was the waitress who served us was extremely sweet and accomodating. Definitely recommend.
27,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute little bakery! Ideal for a quick coffee and a sweet/ cake. I really liked the cheesecake and the brownies. I also liked the atmosphere and the decor. Be aware that is usually quite busy, but you should give it a try anyway!"
28,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We just passed by and being attracted by all  fancy cakes they looked so yummy. Then we decide to take out the carrot cake & lemon poppy seed , it's very delicious."
29,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This little cafe serves a wide variety of sweet and savory pastries. Their sandwich and bread pudding were delicious. Plus, they served an amazing hot mocha. Recommended !"
30,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"The food was absolutely delicious, but the servers were clearly overwhelmed and it was almost impossible to get any attention to get a menu, order, or get the bill. Unfortunately this didn‚Äôt change once the crowd thinned out. Don‚Äôt go if you have any time constraints."
31,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,A very cozy and comfortable atmosphere with super friendly workers
32,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A store coming out of a fairytale. The friendly environment, the amazing smell of the baking goodies and the jazz music on the background with the sound of the rain outside just made me love it. One quiche with pumpkin, almonds and feta and one vegan orange cake this time. I will definitely go back to try more!!"
33,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It‚Äôs a ‚Äòmust visit‚Äô in Amsterdam. Everything is homemade and looks delicious. Good for both savoury and sweet, coffee and tea. It‚Äôs small but adorable. One of my favorites in the city"
34,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing desserts, cakes, pies, sandwiches and a salade of the day.
Homemade, handmade right in front of your eyes at the bar. ‚Ä¶"

Very comfy, cute and friendly staff.
Also great for pics if you seat outside."

37,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice location, good and friendly service, excellent breakfast, tasty and delicious"
38,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We passed by this place out of chance as we were waiting for our table at pancake upstairs. This caf√©‚Äôs atmosphere is quaint, cost and rustic. ‚Ä¶"
39,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"De Laatste Kruimel is cake heaven: the amount of pastries available is insane, and the drinks are very nice too. There is also a nice small terrace over a canal. Unfortunately, queues are frequent, especially in the middle of the afternoon. Come around 5 for a quieter time. This place is really worth it."
40,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty sweet Sandwiches, made freshly for you. Really friendly service, and a owner that does not hesitate to engage into a conversation with you. I have to take away a star, as the menu is really confusing. Food is in a good price range."
41,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"In ther center of the city, this small bakery have good products, nice pastries, amazing location and fantastic shop.
It's good that you can show how they create the products.
About cleaning, They have to grow up."
42,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Authentic dutch Appeltaart in a beautiful location. Especially the little outside spot, overlooking one of the canals is beautiful. The cake was quite pricey but also huge in size ;) ‚Ä¶"
43,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow! What a great place. Delicious pastries, nice coffee. We were sitting on the balcony with fabulous canal view, friendly and kind staff . You must try the banana bread !!!"
44,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Cute place. Decently good quiche. Can get quite busy. Prices are a bit high for what they offer tho I think
45,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"All the bakery is HOMEMADE ! I really enjoyed the Applepie! It's not the usual recipe because it reminds me of the strudel, but maybe it's the Dutch version. Anyway it was very tasty. The black coffee was very aromatic and a nice strong taste. Go there and enjoy a slice of something delicious with a cup of coffee!"
46,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was included with our RUST B&B and we absolutely loved it. Traditional Dutch breakfast and friendly service. We were only Americans and they were very friendly and accommodating to our English.
47,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Recommended as a must visit place by our local hosts...The Last Crumb was amazing. We tried the quiche and salad, both of which were outstanding. My wife is allergic to glutten and the glutten free chocolate cake was mind blowing."
48,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice cosy place with a small balcony over the canal. We got a slice of quiche which was tasty! Very cute atmosphere.
49,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place, but in my opinion the apple pie is just average. I was expecting more as it is mentioned in several list of best places to eat apple pie in Amsterdam."
50,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The savoury and sweet lunch (mixed) is gorgeous! Really love the kitchen vibe, the music, and everything. Definitely back very soon for more :)"
51,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Dropped by for a quick meal after reading the reviews and I was amazed by the wonderful choices they had! Would definitely recommend the portebello mushroom and tomato pie, which was such a wonderful blend of flavours! Waiting time for the food can be a bit long at peak hours as they have few staff but food is great!!"
52,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Went in november. The people were very nice and warm! I highly recommend the apple pie, it was delicious! <3"
53,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We had such expectations coming here, great location, lovely terrace, cozy small place inside, quiches look amazing... But it's just the looks... Got super dissapointed after trying them, got three different ones and the experience was the ‚Ä¶"
54,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Don't eat here if you're in a rush. The food was good but the service was chaotic. It took over an hour just to get a croissant and jam.
55,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great pies and cakes, fresh mixed salad, good cofee and scones. Bakery heaven.

If you arrive early in the morning you can watch the pies come to live."
56,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The decor is very cute and cozy! Wooden cratelike chairs, floral cushions, mismatched tables, etc. It's also a pretty narrow place and it was quite crowded when I went on a Thursday afternoon. The quiche was delicious, and the chai latte ‚Ä¶"
57,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just yummy anything - go on and indulge, this place sells heaven;) That being said it only offers seating for approx. 15 people, but those few tables keep moving quite rapidly."
58,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely delicious! Visit this place! Service was not great and the place is extremely popular, but it is worth a go. De-li-cious."
59,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"They have really good cakes and sandwiches. The coffee is strong but good as well. The service is also amazing, the people are really nice. The shop looks super sweet and it's really cozy in there.
Would recommend!"
60,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Fabulous inside decoration. Do go there. Just know the cakes are sweet in the 'we bake with a kilo of sugar per cake' way. I get that it should be sweet. But less is more here. ü§î
61,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty cakes, great teas, huge quiches.. little cute place for breakfast, lunch and coffee break.. cakes average 5‚Ç¨ a piece.. I‚Äôll be back!"
62,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Basically everything I wanted for a breakfast, came in right as it was opening and sat down with my latte and the best French Toast I ever had (was more like a dense almond croissant with sugar). People started to pour in. Beautiful place, amazing display of pastries in the windows, highly recommend."
63,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place with super friendly stall. Everything that I got was delicious.
The place has a super cool small balcony with few tables right on the water. Must visit if in amsterdam."
64,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,a month ago,"in about 2 weeks time I bought 3 times the same thing and they give me 3 times different price, when I ask why they just say it is what it is, seems like getting very cocky when the business is good, check the price before you buy anything, it is whatever they want."
65,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very disappointing and unsatisfying experience! Not worth the money! Had the tiniest piece of carrot cake with a flat white - served on a paper plate and in a to go cup - for 8,50‚Ç¨. The taste was okay, but keep in mind that the it‚Äôs not a cream cheese frosting - it‚Äôs just a sugar coating... wouldn‚Äôt eat there again."
66,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This is the best place we discovered in Amsterdam! We stayed in the city for 5 days and came back to this bakery every day we were here. It‚Äôs amazing!! You must try the French toast pastry.
67,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice with great food but very very crowded in summer.
68,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cosy, great sandwiches an quiches. We went back here the next day to eat breakfast. Their freshly squeezed orange juice was excellent.
During summer or warmer autumn/spring one can sit outside overlooking the canal which is right outside."
69,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful. Intimate atmosphere and super friendly staff for a fantastic coffe break and mid day snack. Huge variety of home made cakes make it even more of an experience. Must visit
70,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,11 months ago,I love De Laaste Kruimel. So many sweet cozy  lunches here with dear friends. And we had them cater cakes and quiche for our wedding reception. Has a very special place in my heart!
71,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,A really beautiful small coffeeplace with good coffee and dry but still delicious banana bread. It would be really cool if you had actual cups and plates so that we don't produce as much garbage - i've never eaten from paper plates sitting inside a cafe.
72,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great coffee, delicious pies and scons! And the best of it is the decoration!!"
73,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"4 stars only because there isn't a toilet inside. Centred position, cozy inside, wide choice."
74,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great variety of sweet and salty pastries. Very trendy place with a nice atmosphere, highly recommended"
75,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,11 months ago,Beautiful and cozy store and fine sandwiches. The baguette with turkey and truffle mayo was lovely. However: not pleased at all with the sweet bakes... The scones were superdry and stale. And the walnut & caramel pie was old too... A waste ‚Ä¶
76,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely magic little cafe with a beautiful terrace right on the canal. The kitchen is directly inside the cafe so you can smell the cakes and baking.
77,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Sweet merciful God, these sandwiches are good. The rest of Amsterdam can go to hell... save only de laaste kruimel."
78,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I took a picture of these cake things, but I got a couple of quiches as well. The lavender and orange bread is amazeballs. I got everything to go. I also got a chocolate chip scone with clotted cream and jam (they'll wrap that for you as well)!"
79,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Charming, living room style seating (especially upstairs), and scones (with cream and jam) to die for."
80,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice place and great staff
Breakfast is on of the best in amsterdam with great variety and delicious breakfast meals"

82,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,We passed by this coffee place and could not resist to enter it seeing the awesome cakes and pies. This place is absolutely charming and the service is great. We had a salty pie and a piece of walnut cake.. it was delicious! ‚Ä¶
83,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"It‚Äôs a cosy little bakery with lovely food. The coffee could be way better though. The personal is friendly, a ted slow sometimes."
84,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We stopped because it looked good, went inside and saw a huge chocolate chip cookie, couldn't resist so we ordered one To-Go; obviously added a slice of the irresistible walnut-caramel cake. ‚Ä¶"
85,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Atmosphere, a great location,   a very good music, and the food & coffe were refined And delicious !!!"
86,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and stellar cakes. Smoothest, creamiest cheese cake I've ever tasted and the moist vegan chocolate cake is poetry. Had a bread pudding with meat as well. Very nice but I preferred their cakes over salty dishes. The place is very ‚Ä¶"
87,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"5/5 for the food

I love it"
88,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice spot close in the center. Friendly staff with an amazing quality of food :)
89,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,8 months ago,In love with this bakeryüñ§ Excellent quality and service. Also a really cute balcony to where you can sit and enjoy a good coffee.

91,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Everything is fantastic!
92,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place is a gem! We went there twice in three days because we were so impressed. The scones were absolutely divine combined with their homemade jam. My friend was most impressed with her cheese croissant. Definitely the best in Amsterdam!
93,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,4 months ago,"So many people and personal cant stay calm with it, and get to be rude for guests, so sad, coffee was nice"
94,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The pastries selection is quite massive, quality is excellent. Strategic location, but the place is a bit cramped"
95,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very good place with the cozy atmosphere! The cakes are delicious and coffee tastes decent. For me it felt like a little Paris in the center of Amsterdam. Highly recommend.
96,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best bakery everrr. It‚Äôs so cute and has a great atmosphere (bomb music). The quiches are all to die for and the sweets are also amazing. I came alone twice and once with two other friends and each time was great.
97,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Place: beautiful and cosy. Food: awesome. The girls are so nice and gentle (thanks to Moerja, she was very kind with us, just like the others ü§ó‚ù§). We will be back once we will fly again to Amsterdam!"
98,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,a year ago,"This place used to be amazing. They used to have the best Pastrami sandwich in Amsterdam, which I would get once or twice a week. Everyone of my friends that would come in town I would take here for the pastrami sandwich and they always ‚Ä¶"
99,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I absolutely love Kruimel‚Äôs brownies. It is the place to go for sandwiches, cakes and pastry. The cafe itself is quite small, and usually packed, but if you pop in early, you‚Äôll probably get a chance to take an outdoor seat with a lovely view of the cityüö≤"
100,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,This for sure is a must visit when in Amsterdam! The amazing homemade food is just one side of it. The people working there were so friendly and made us feel really cosy with tasty bites and outgoing attitude. We somehow spent 3 hours there and it felt not more than 30 minutes.
101,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent tartes, cakes, salad etc. Mostly vegetarian.
Friendly service."
102,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing breakfast, beautiful place and a friendly service!"
103,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, friendly staff, original decoration and cozy atmosphere."
104,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Prices are relatively reasonable for the quality and reputation of this establishment. Very cosy atmosphere though very little sitting. No restroom.
105,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A really nice and cozy place with a beautiful small balcony with view on the canal and very tasty pastries and quiche.
106,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Overall excellent place. I got a bacon mushroom and onion pie and my companions got quiches. They were all amazing, extremely delicious and quite filling. We also got an apple pie, and even though the saying is ""as American as apple pie"" ‚Ä¶"
107,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Me and my friend were just strolling around and saw this shop that had lots of beautiful cakes and pastries on display and as expected, we could not hold ourselves back from entering inside. We took coffee and orange cake. The orange cake had no sugar and yet it was sweet and fresh with big chunks of oranges. Amazing place!"
108,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place was delicious. It became my morning ‚Äògo to‚Äô while visiting Amsterdam.  Great breakfast quiches and I slowly started to try the tasty sweets. They have an awesome chocolate cookie too.
109,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really cute hidden spot! I loved the atmosphere & the food.
110,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,4 months ago,We asked a cup of coffee but they were so rude n said take ur money back n leave.
111,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy place near the centre, with amazing food. Bit pricy but everything is pricy in the city centre"
112,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to have a (sweet) lunch. Atmosphere is awesome and it's one of its kinds. Must visit.
113,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great quiches and nice sandwiches. The desserts were a little hit and miss, though they all looked amazing. The cheesecake was the surprise winner. Not too dense, flavorful with some tangy cherries to cut the richness. Awesome! ‚Ä¶"
114,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Hidden gem in the centre of Amsterdam and one of the best bakeries / coffee shops in town. Delicious pastries, excellent coffee and very friendly staff.
I am looking forward to having breakfast on the lovely back terrace by the water, when possible again."
115,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The best coffee and pastry. The place is beautiful and cozy, and the staff is very friendly."
116,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cute place, lots of cakes, toasties and salads you have so much choices for your breakfast or quick lunch that you won't be disappointed and everything is homemade, also their coffee is very good,  staff very friendly too. Highly recommended"
117,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good and nice bar for a brunch in the city center with a lot of excellent homemade dishes and sweets. The staff is very friendly and the prices are cheap. The only negative thing is that they haven't a toilet. So take care of it in case you want to have a brunch there. Highly recommended
118,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A cozy place to enjoy a cake or quiche. Everytime I visit this cafe, it's crowded."
119,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Found this place in Google Maps, was noted as one of the best places to eat apple pie. Apples were amazing :) but the tart/pie was sooo dry, I couldn't eat. Maybe it's a bad day, I don't know and don't want to be rude; but I'm very ‚Ä¶"
120,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Holy moly, cake heaven! Probably the cutest bakery I have ever been to. They have amazing banana bread, daily vegan muffin, and brownies. They also serve a lot of savoury food.  The cafe has an open kitchen so you get to sit next to a ‚Ä¶"
121,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice ambience however the staff was quite rude. When I checked about my chocolate cake, having already received another cake and coffee, I was told I only have 2 hands. Another staff me member persistently asked a customer to move long the ‚Ä¶"
122,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Cute place seems local in a touristy area but very Disappointing food. Apple pie and chocolate cake were tasteless and definitely not fresh... It's weird because it is popular and you would expect that they would serve fresh food but unfortunately this is not the case. Maybe it was the day but I am Not going back..
123,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Extremely yummy sweets and people! Dont miss this place ‚ù§ there are places inside with a canal view
124,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We come here every time we are in Amsterdam. From the front windows you can see all their food from savory to sweet. It's all made fresh in their kitchen. It's a tiny little place with cozy homey interior. There is a great outside canal ‚Ä¶
125,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Cappuccino was so tasty! üòã
126,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great breakfast spot!
The outdoor seating out back has a great view (see picture).
The quiches were all good (we had the goat cheese and leek).
Try the coconut-banana bread - it was excellent"
127,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,Please ... don't stop making the vegan muffins! I will return just to eat them again  ... so good!
128,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a cute name for a cake shop, unfortunately not really convinced. I‚Äôve had the chocolate vanilla cake for take-away. The cake has been quite dry and no freshly home-baked taste, more like cake you also get in the supermarket."
129,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"By coincidence, we walked by this pretty place and immediately fell in love with it! Everything is so lovely and delicious and the taste is even better! Plus this tiny little terrace - definitely a must go! ‚Ä¶"
130,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Everything looks really delicious, but that can be misleading sometimes. Both, quiche and pie, we tried were OK but really not something to write home about. Menu is kind of chaotic and complicated, I understand it was possibly meant to be ‚Ä¶"
131,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I couldn't say enough great things about this bakery. We went there for breakfast all three days of our stay in Amsterdam and had no regrets. Delicious pastries, tasty orange juice, and smiling faces. They have an adorable patio overlooking the canal in the back as well. Check it out!"
132,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing & full of flavor cakes and coffee!
133,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A cozy Cafe with delicious sandwiches and great coffee. Staff was very friendly and helpful!
It is quite small and has limited seating but they have made the most of the space they have which makes it cozy. I highly recommend a visit!"
134,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We stumbled across this place when looking for sandwiches. Turned out to be a great find and after looking at some of the reviews, it all makes sense. Great little spot with great sandwiches, service and coffee! We had two sandwiches, a water and coffee around $21 euros. Great food!"
135,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This is just for tourists. For hungry and street wandering tourists. Nothing is quality, every thing I ate was dry. I fall each and every time for the cute display and sweet, cozy ambiance but let me tell you one thing; it doesn't taste as ‚Ä¶"
136,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Perfect food and menu. Try their quiches!  Extremely cosy place.
137,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,7 years ago,We stumbled upon this cafe while walking around Amsterdam and it was amazing. We had the mushroom and hazelnut pesto quiche and the leek and goat cheese cheese -- both of which were simply amazing. We sat for over an hour and watched the ‚Ä¶

140,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,4 years ago,I had heard great things so I came here with high expectations. I ordered both a savory (tomato and onion) and sweet bread pudding (mixed berry). Both of them were so dense! It was like I had been served flavored clay. This place is all hype and a major tourist trap.
141,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little place to sit and relax. Ok tea, the scones are ok, the cakes are delicious. The staff is personable, but I had an experience with a grumpy female staff. WiFi is available. The atmosphere is very cozy. I would go again."
142,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing handmade food in a very cozy place. The outside seating is small but if you manage to get a seat it's really a beautiful place to eat your food or drink your coffee with a pretty view of the canal below you and the bridge in front. If you get a chance to stop here, do it"

144,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite breakfast spot in Amsterdam! The terrace is Amazing and perfect to chill
145,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute little cake shop hidden in the Amsterdam city center. The ambiance is cozy and quirky and the pies are delicious. The amount of variety is stunning!
Make sure you eat on the little balcony over the canal for the full experience!"
146,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great sandwiches and quiches and super friendly staff
147,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place was really ""cute"" =>warm & cozy.
Really small tables but adorable.
The outside seats were a plus. But its windy ,so we choose to be inside instead. ‚Ä¶"
148,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The coffees and the food here: overpriced (but okay Amsterdam), but very tasty. Can definitely recommend :) ‚Ä¶"
149,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Atmospheric place and friendly staff. The baked goods look amazing but are frankly lackluster in taste and texture. Out of 4 goods ordered 3 were dry and tasteless. All in all quite disappointing considering the high praise by reviewers on Google maps.
150,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a fantastic lunch option, especially if you are able to conquer a spot on what is reportedly ""the smallest terrace of Amsterdam"". Food is very good, soup of the day has never dissapointed. Sufficient vegetarian options available. ‚Ä¶"

152,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cute, cozy place with lots of pastries, desserts, and nice coffee. Seating is extremely limited but there‚Äôs some seating around the area outside or take away your pastries and walk around. Bonus if you can snag a seat on the back patio overlooking the canal!"
153,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful coffee shop, delicious cakes."
154,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very tasty homemade cakes and alike. i simply love their carrot cake. Often very crowded, but don't give up in search for a seat: Most customers don't stay too long."
155,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A really nice place with fantastic staff and food. Took a chicken sandwich that was amazing! A bit crowded since the place is quite small, and missing a toilet. Otherwise a perfect place to stop for a coffee and a small meal!"
156,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Too small for more than a few people at a time, but what they do in this small place is simply amazing. Just peek through the display windows to see all the amazing baked goods and sandwiches they make all in the little tiny exposed kitchen. Delicious, fresh, friendly, and warm atmosphere. Will be back on my next visit!"
157,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Three stars if you come here for a longer dish. Because they have no rest room. If you want to get a quick bite, it is pretty good. Service is fine. It is obviously a bit touristy. The desserts are good though!"
158,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Awesome, really awesome place! With popular French music in the background you can enjoy homemade tarts, sandwiches or desserts sitting on wooden pallets with pillows on it. ‚Ä¶"
159,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very sweet staff with great recommendations!! Loved the goat cheese quiche, zucchini lemon curd cake, and the carrot cake. Beautiful view and the fresh baked smells are a huge plus. :)"

161,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing food, made before your very eyes as you sit and drink tea, eat cake or quiche and enjoy the strange and wonderful environment. The tiny canalside outdoor terrace is delightful on a sunny day too. ‚Ä¶"
162,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"So disappointed with my first taste of Amsterdam! Service was slow and not overly friendly. I got the polenta, and though they put it in the oven, the chill was barely gone ‚Äì it would be an exaggeration to say it was lukewarm. Some salt ‚Ä¶"

164,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute little bakery hidden around the city center.
Watch out: delicious lorraines, cakes, anything that can guarantee a full-flavoured brunch. Very cosy, maybe just a little bit small. ‚Ä¶"

168,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I've been here at 2015 for the first time. It was a great morning stop for breakfast lovers. They do have these various and great rasting quiches and croissants with a great coffee. Don't miss it!
169,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I can‚Äôt speak to how this place compares to other little cute, tasty cafes around Amsterdam because I haven‚Äôt been to them all. All I know is that the quality and service at this place, in a delightfully homey and cozy setting, make this a wonderful place to stop for breakfast, lunch, brunch, a snack, a coffee, a tea, etc etc."
170,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good place for a little bite. They have amazing food, all made with passion. ‚Ä¶"
171,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,2 years ago,"As a Dutchie I can say it seriously was the worst quality apple pie I've ever had. Insane. (I don't care about the price, but it was almost 10 euros for 2 persons if you are curious.) I never really give reviews, but the apple pie is a scam so safe your money."
172,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great service. Great selection. Great coffee. Fast service. Beautiful little place. Friendly stuff. I loved the food. It's delicious. 1 star less because everything comes in or on paper which causes a lot of waste
173,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Terrible service and hygiene issue. There were only two of us in the shop in the beginning and the waitress was very impatient and irritated, didn‚Äôt even bother to explain their menu. What annoying the most was she didn‚Äôt wash her hand or ‚Ä¶"
174,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing place. The service is great and you can actually see how they cook the cakes and stuff. Lovely decoration! Also great prices for being Amsterdam Centre!
175,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute. Food is good. Ambiance is super nice. Service is a bit edgy and rude...made for an irritable morning. They couldn‚Äôt seem to customer orders sorted and made a fuss about getting my receipt (expense filing, need those receipts!)"
176,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Lemonade was way too sweet. The scone was good, but the place was overpriced. We paid 11‚Ç¨ for two lemonades and a scone."
177,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cute cafe with a small patio right on the canal. The espresso and mocha latt√© were rich and creamy. And the chocolate cake with ganache was delicious! Very friendly service.
178,De Laatske Krumel, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Bad service.

Waited 40 min for broccoli pie to get warm and still didn't got it... ‚Ä¶"
179,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Coffee in a paper cup to sit down in an upmarket spot? Sorry no way. Food was decent.
180,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A very nice and cute place in De Wallen. Amazing cakes and pastries, a wide range of quiches. Tasty chai and moca, cakes for 3-4‚Ç¨, coffee around 3-4‚Ç¨.
The only minus is that it is very small and crowded with no bathroom"
181,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Quite over hyped. We ordered three deserts and coffee and all were underwhelming. The lemon poppy seed muffin was full of baking soda and the apple pie was over done with cinnamon. Maybe it was a bad choice for that day.
182,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Poor vegan options for such a reach menu. But the prices are insene. Almost 4 ‚Ç¨for a muffin. Don't think I will try come here again for breakfast.
183,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,11 months ago,One of the best keep secrets of Amsterdam! Lovely vegan choco cake to die for.
184,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice vegan food, very cosy!"
185,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Sweet little cake shop hidden away off the Amsterdam canals and away from the bustling main shopping strip in town. While it's small, it's worth trying to nab yourself on the dainty little crates and trying out their home made cakes along with a nice coffee or tea."
186,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely tiny place. Everything is home made and of the highest quality. Crowded and narrow but worth any, minute you spend and all the calories you eat. A place to remember and come back."
187,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Most delicious cafe with scones and clotted cream. Also had the quiche and salad and it was to die for. This was my fave food place in Amsterdam can't wait to go back!
188,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious carrot cake and adorable decor! Wish they had a place like this back in Bristol, England x will definitely return when back in Amsterdam."
189,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty cakes, self service, bit overpriced."
190,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Everything is unbelievably tasty and quite big in portion, plus the place is just so lovely! I love their mackerel sandwich! Things are slightly more expensive than other spots, though!"

192,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent quiches, coffees, and baked goods for very cheap!"
193,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful place with great decorations and atmosphere. I tried 3 cakes but all of them were a bit stale and didn't have a good taste..
194,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great little place to get some freshly baked goods. The terrace outside is the smallest in Amsterdam, it's great to watch the boats cruise by. No bathroom though."
195,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"sandwich, quiche or breadpudding - cannot make a bad choice. it's all made fresh in front of you, fantastic to sit in the smell of the fresh baked bread. plus a terrace with canal view..."
196,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,Simply the best sandwiches and pastries. And the cutest terras in the city. But it is time to change the furniture.
197,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very sweet & small Cafe. The Apple pie was amazing, everything Else looked great too. Prices are fine. :)"
198,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazingly great food! The sandwich was off the chain and the polenta was incredible. It's unfair for good to be that good.
Staff were nice and service wwa speedy."
199,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly and cheerful staff. We were here half an hour before closing so that might have been the reason for forgetting my quiche. It was tasty tho, worth waiting :)"
200,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely cafe, came across it because of the spellbinding window, full of cakes, and it lived  up to expectations, has loads of character and has great vegan options."
201,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The price is bit too pricey for me. I bought 2 lemonade for 6.60 euro. And idk about the cake because I don't buy any. And yes this place is always crowded and not easy to find a place to sit
202,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice, small corner terrace ! Good pastries!"
203,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loving the decoration,  the food and the place.  Cozy place that you can spend time at without feeling bored,  great music and friendly staff. Amazing! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
204,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Croissants were disappointing, sandwiches depends on what you order, quiche is consistently pretty good. Always too hot inside and no air .."
205,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Quite clich√© but nice overall. Coffee quality is alright but it gets served in to-go cups only. A good stopover though.
206,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Just an awesome little caf√© with the best quiche, meat pie, cakes, pies, cupcakes and everything you dream about! A really cozy and lovely layedback atmosphere! A must-go-to! <3"

210,De Laatske Krumel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great cakes (baked on the premises) and really delicious coffee. A shame they use so much disposable plastic (even not for take away).
211,De Laatske Krumel, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Super crowded place, not nice for a date or business lunch. More for takeaways. We had the cake and coffee and they're just so-so, not particularly great."
212,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Exceptionally dry and dough-like banana cake that had an uneven mix of flour and banana. The centre was overly moist while the crust was dry and hard to swallow.
213,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Amazing place for lunch or coffe and cakes!
214,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to have lunch or enjoy a hot drink and a pastry. The choco vanilla bread is heaven!

219,De Laatske Krumel, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Our favorite place in Amsterdam. Pull up a bench to the sit-down bar and have a fresh pastry and tea while the workers bake in front of you.
220,De Laatske Krumel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,not as good as it might seem from the outside .. The cakes are not bad but there is poor cleaning in the preparation of the sandwiches and they don't have a toilet.
