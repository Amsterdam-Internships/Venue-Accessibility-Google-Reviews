0,Bagels & Beans IJdock, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very clean parking garage!  The pillars are all encased for protection.  We booked online and paid 17 EUR for the whole day in Amsterdam. With license plate recognition: just drive in (pull your parking ticket) and drive out again.
1,Bagels & Beans IJdock, 5 stars ,a year ago,"THE BEST parking garage ever, never before I have experienced such a good value for money. It is easy to access and if you make a reservation online you will pay a maximum of 20 EUR/24h. You will park in a light parking garage with bumpers ‚Ä¶"

7,Bagels & Beans IJdock, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best parking solutions in AMS! IJDock is easy to reach (just a few min. walk from Central station).

10,Bagels & Beans IJdock, 4 stars ,4 years ago,10 euros a day that's pretty cheap for parking in Amsterdam. It's pretty close to the city center. It would be nicer if the ticket was good for 24 hours and you could choose the time of arrival instead of it being good for midnight to midnight.
11,Bagels & Beans IJdock, 1 star ,3 years ago,Be careful! The payment system of this parking works like a deceive machine. If you have an online reservation you cannot continie it before it ends. You have to wait the moment when your reservation ends then you have to exit the parking ‚Ä¶

20,Bagels & Beans IJdock, 1 star ,5 years ago,"the worst parking ever. some people book the tickets with 50% discount, but there is no free parking spot when they arrive. So they park the car just on the passage way, then your car gets blocked for hours untill the owner comes. In other words, administration sells more than the parking actually can bear."
