0,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, warm and cozy. The place was packed with both tourists and locals. Their burger was not the best I've had and I guess on busy days you have to wait a few minutes for your order to be taken and for your food to arrive (which was …"
1,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great restaurant with reasonable prices for inner city Amsterdam.Very nice option to have a coffe or a glas of wine. I liked it a lot. Because they also follow reviews and big 5 stars. Absolutely great!
2,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the better grand cafés on the Rembrandtplein. Friendly staff and good service. Food is also ok here whether its snacks, lunch or dinner. If youre looking for a cosy place to have some drinks with Art Deco style this is the place to go to."
3,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best café in Amsterdam! Been regular there since more than 15 years.
4,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Always good service and good quality food and drinks. Staff very kind and service is quick. All day long open for breakfast, lunch, dinner & drinks. Very recomendable."
5,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible. Food less than mediocre. Main dishes not available. Service good but unaware of what the kitchen can do. Avoid! A tourist trap. …
6,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Simple and clean.
We had to wait a bit to be served, but the people are very nice and the food tasty. Beware, they are generous in term of taste, but also in quantity in your …"
7,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We came on Friday after 5 pm. There were not so many people inside. Service was okay. Some beer selections as well. The chicken I ordered was tasty with nothing to complain. Location is also fine as close to the centre but not exactly there and hence no crowdy.
8,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Simple place, slow service. We sat outside and felt completely ignored. Had to go inside to order ourselves because the waitress never came around. Ok soup, but the toasted sandwich was literally two slices of bread and cheese, not worth it."
9,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, nice views, nice staff and perfect club sadwich!"
10,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good place as a cafe and restautant in this location👍🏻
11,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Surprisingly affordable for the location. Nice choice of lunch meals, quite inviting, nice and roomy. Great for a team lunch if you work nearby. As far as I can tell a brilliant drinks selection as well, like you would expect from such a place."
12,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It has a nice few of the Rembrandt square and the staff is reeeaaally nice. I think they believed my sister and me to be be a couple so they treated us good but I think they are always like that. Really fast service too. 5/5 would eat there again.
13,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,a year ago,"We had the Italian and the bacon burger. It was the worst burgers I have ever seen and ''tried'' to eat. The meat was not cooked at all, mozzarella was not fresh, tomato was so small to fit a burger and the pesto which was supposed to be …"
14,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"With a lovely large outdoor seating area, this grand café, tucked away in the far left corner of Rembrandtplein has much to offer in the generally crowded square. Along with the outdoor seating comes a nice indoor area in the greenhouse …"
15,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Good Cafe, I enjoyed a lot...."
16,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The location is nice. But I ate the worst Burger ever ! The bread was hard and the meat was obviously not fresh but frozen before. The other dishes of my mates were as bad as mine. …
17,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice menu, the meat was good and tender which is not minor considering I am from Argentina. Beer was also pretty good, and it has a nice ambience and view of the Rembrandt plaza. The menu is pretty simple but that is to be expected from a place in such a touristic spot."
18,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great restaurant with reasonable prices for inner city Amsterdam. We had the warm chicken salad and the warm goats cheese salad respectively. Both were lovely. …
19,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Take shelter under the tents to enjoy decent food and good drinks.
20,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Whilst the mulled wine  was acceptable, WARNING do not order the fish and chips. Four pieces of brown to almost burnt to crisp fish dried out from being aged  under a heat lamp plus some of the worst rubbery french fries. These were mottled …"
21,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Although located on Rembrandtplein, this place has preserved its authenticity. The staff is very friendly. As a regular customer, I had the pleasure of meeting all the staff members and they were all professional and pleasant."
22,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A nice cafe to sit inside (or out) depending on the weather.
23,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,3 years ago,Not great nachos. My mate had cold toast literally picked off her plate and replaced (not by hand) with fresh toast. At least I hope it was fresh and not reheated!  Unbelievable. Shame. The place has potential
24,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Went for nachos and cheese plate as a snack in the evening together with some wine. Was good but nothing special. Decent service and a relaxing place to watch people in the square.
25,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, overall it was a nice experience. The staff was nice, but kind of busy. It was a bit crowded so maybe that was why we had a hard time getting a waiter."
26,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly staff and good service. Less busy than next door.
27,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"If you're looking for something dull and rather non-exciting in the middle of tourist overrun area, look no further, Grand Cafe l'Opera is here to satisfy your needs. You get mildly under-cooked snacks, waiters cleverly ignoring your …"
28,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Food just ok.  Service very slow. No explanation by our waitress.  A different waiter apologized as we were leaving saying they had a cooking staff issue...
29,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Came. Sat down. Ordered tea and water, and chose the dinner items. Called the waiter 5 times. He was avoiding us as if we had a dead rat on the table. 40 min of wait, 7.50 euro for tea and water, and off we went."
30,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Was ignored when entering, having atleast 3 waiters avoid eye contact with us for 15 minutes. When we finally ordered the food we received looked like it was from a gas station. The vegetarian burger was not presentable and the coffee was unimpressive. Would not recommend."
31,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was okay, the service not unfriendly, but our main problem was the long wait: to order, to get the drinks, to get the menu, to get the food. The staff worked hard enough, just understaffed I guess."
32,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Waitresses were rude.
Food ordered medium well- came rare. Sent it back, came back well done.
Quite pricey for a rude service.
Doesn’t recommend it to anyone"
33,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice terrace
They could work a bit better on customer care"
34,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food takes way too long to be served, waiters/waitresses very rude, took hours to serve two simple paninis!!!! Do not go here there are much better places to eat in Amsterdam!!!!"

36,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very bad experience, i left hungry . They messed up my steak 2x had to send it back for the 2nd try as well. Not friendly waiters. Very disappointed"
37,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Brilliant drinks but the food is just amazing! Steak & duck confit with potatoes & vegetables side dishes. Cannot recommend highly enough.
38,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food and good beer. Staff were great, service a bit on the slow side but they had a large party in so understandable."
39,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 3 stars ,4 years ago,friendly staff but their nachos are terrible (esp. tortilla chips with melted cheese: never-ever order! they just melt the cheese with the tortilla chips in the microwave and your tortilla chips are all soggy and stuck together!!!)
40,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,a year ago,Their spaghetti is perfect and the all waiters are kind and 5 stars definitely 😉
41,Grand Caf√© l'Opera, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice option to have a coffe or a glas of wine. I liked it a lot. Very fancy and the personnel was friendly. At least the one waitress who attended us.
