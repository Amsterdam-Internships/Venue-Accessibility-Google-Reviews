0,Peperwortel, 1 star ,5 months ago,Falafel and beer only. Skip the rest. The have a great location and a very good idea. Unfortunately they cannot deliver. Pitas average and chicken extremely dry and tasteless. Wine overpriced vis a vis quality. Go somewhere else ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"WOW! We used peperwortel catering services for a 5 day film production. The food was healthy AND delicious, always delivered on time and served hot. Great mix of hot/cold food for lunch and generous portions and lots of snacks. 12 hour days ‚Ä¶"
2,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"My favorite spot on overtom to have lunch or grab a coffee. The chicken Granada is awesome and the spinach and goat cheese quiche is a classic there for a reason ü§§
The staff is so kind üëç"
3,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super cool place with great food. Try quiche spinach and more:)
4,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love the food, when you look from the outside its like nothing but once u taste the food its worth to come by...staff are friendly and its really different ambience inside;)"
5,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Exceeded the expectations in all aspects. Quick reaction time, flexible, considerate, very professional. The quality of the food was superb and the service fantastic."
6,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Best amsterdam food. We had been there in 2015 and but I could never forget the amazing taste and even the address. You are awesome!
7,Peperwortel, 2 stars ,2 years ago,It took us more than one hour to get our food. No drinks were served meanwhile. In a place where the food is already made and they just need to warm it up... The food was tasy. The lasagna came burned
8,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great and tastyful food options. In one world: flavor.
9,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice home made food
10,Peperwortel, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is quite tasty and healthy (my friend likes). Friendly staff. This place is popular among locals. I would give 5üéñ, but very dirty look of the staff and this place in general, force me to give only 2üéñ. Because if it is going about the food, it has to be clean without any exception."
11,Peperwortel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I was a little bit disappointed with the vegan version of a Libanese dish. I guess the lamb was substituted with beans which made the dish dry. There was no vegan dip while the original recipe was served with a side of yoghurt I believe. ‚Ä¶
12,Peperwortel, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food although overpriced is tasty. The real problem with this place is the staff, who gave me a receipt (and a bill) which didn't correspond to what I ordered (wasn't a mistake), and when later asked about it, lied to me about what I ordered. Just short with their customer, unfriendly and eventually untrustworthy."
13,Peperwortel, 1 star ,4 years ago,"There must be some misunderstanding. The price, as other reviews mentioned, is one problem, but the thing is, what they offer can hardly be difined as food. The chicken is so dry that it could drain the river of the Amazon forest. Other stuff just so-so. The best dish I recommend is the 3-euro salad from Albert Heijn nearby."
14,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved the thing that I ordered. Something with minced lamb. :)
15,Peperwortel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The decoration and its outdoor vibe put you in a ""craving for something delicious"" mood. Unfortunately it didn't meet our expectations. Mediocre food and not value for money( not even close). Too expensive for what you get."
16,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty, warm and welcoming. Perfect place to recoup your energy after a long stroll in Vodelpark. Tram stop right outside to take you back into the centre. Will make sure i return next time i'm in Amsterdam for sure. Dank je"
17,Peperwortel, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Plain sandwiches ordered for children were still charged at full price of ‚Ç¨7.50 each for a small bap with a few sausages. Tomato, caper and onion salad could have had more flavour. Decent food but very over priced with no accommodation for clients wanted simpler portions."
18,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious well balanced comfort food. Lunch lasagna with side of roasted eggplant and peppers was ‚Ç¨11. Free tap water available ;)
19,Peperwortel, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good price for meals, however not the broad choice of meals and so-so service. Additionally, they don‚Äôt cook food there, everything pre-cooked and then heated in the microwave"
20,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Yummy Tasty Lovely üòâüòäüòãüòö
21,Peperwortel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice people excellent sangria, houmous and falafel"
