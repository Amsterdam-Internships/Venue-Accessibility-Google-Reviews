2,Na Siam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delectable thai cuisine! The staff is extremely client oriented, they offer a customer service BEYOND perfect (my son dropped my spoon on the floor and by the time i went down to retrieve it, the waitress already had brought me a new one)."
3,Na Siam, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Had a lovey meal here yesterday.  Very knowledgeable staff on gluten free options.

5,Na Siam, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The food is delicious, and the owners are very welcoming and hospitable."
6,Na Siam, 5 stars ,10 months ago,My favorite place for Thai food in Amsterdam. Try paneng nuea or the pla sam rod. Say hi to the owners and cooks. Some of the nicest people you will find.
7,Na Siam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderfull great small Thai restaurant. Owned by Dutch/Thai couple. Authentic Thai cooking with as far as we can tell only Thai in their kitchen. ‚Ä¶
8,Na Siam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"the best Thai food i had in Amsterdam. Ask the owner for Jungle Curry, it is not officially on the menu but if you convince him you are able to eat spicy, his wonderful wife will cook it for you. Very good prices, chilled atmosphere, great Singha beer in stock.... what more to expect? üòÄ"
9,Na Siam, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Super friendly. Food 10/10. I had pad krapao and it was like in Thailand.
10,Na Siam, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I've been here a few times, and this is definitely my favourite Thai restaurant in Amsterdam.

11,Na Siam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"So delicious and it's definitely worth going there, even if you're only doing pick-up. It's nice atmosphere and the owners are lovely!"

13,Na Siam, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Best Thai restaurant by far in Amsterdam and potentially beyond!
14,Na Siam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was good an the price was ok. The warm noodle salat with shirmps and chicken was really good, a little bit spicy but not too much. The wine was good, we drank a south african merlot that went really well with the psicy food. ‚Ä¶"
15,Na Siam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff. But the food wasn‚Äôt very tasty.

18,Na Siam, 1 star ,5 years ago,"the foods was just alright and not a big potion for what they charge. Not cheap for a dish.
