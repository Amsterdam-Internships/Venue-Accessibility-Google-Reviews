0,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 months ago,We visited this brewery because my cousin really wanted to see the windmill! We ended up staying here for hours just talking to the bartenders and enjoying the atmosphere! One thing to note is they stop serving flights at 5p. We must have missed that on the menu because we really wanted to try one! But the Zatte we had was excellent.
1,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Iconic brewery in Amsterdam and a must visit, try the Zatte and Columbus beers. If it's your first time, the tasting is a great way of trying 5 different beers."
2,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Brilliant location for the showroom for brewery 't IJ, which brews really good local beers,well known throughout the country. It's nice to sit on the terrace, with a view on the now famous windmill. Also quite near the famous Dappermarkt, our local street market."
3,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Unfortunately we didn't make it to the tour, but we bought the beers to try them... The place was nice, the service pretty fast. I recommend it a lot! üòä"
4,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great spot in an authentic windmill to taste a selection of good beers directly from the brewery. We love to come here by bike for a break when we visit Amsterdam. Great black IPA if you love that kind of beer.
5,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Never thought I‚Äôd be drinking beer in a windmill. Quality beer selection on tap and super cool vibe. Definitely worth a visit for beer lovers.
6,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,a month ago,"One of the best brewery in Netherlands. People think that it is inside the Windmill but it's just next to the Windmill :)
You can have lots of beer option and they have an outdoor seating as well. ‚Ä¶"
7,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,a month ago,"You have to order drinks at the bar, but can't order any food there and have to do that at a separate place. Paying has to be done IMMEDIATELY with no tabs or anything possible, which all made for an unpleasurable experience. Employees also seem to like eagerly checking for QR codes just a little too much. Beers are good though."
8,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great beers. Typically curt Dutch service. Sadly no tables by the canal so the views are limited. Get an umbrella and you'll get how the Dutch survive the weather while drinking beer üòâ
9,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great beer and tasty snacks. Sometimes too crowded but that‚Äôs what you have to pay when running such a second to none bar. Well done team
10,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Minimalistic beer temple of the local brewery. They serve any of their beers on draught. It is also possible to get a tasting, and relevant snacks that go well with beer, and there are guided tours."
11,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We just went there by bike to see the windmill closer and did not know there was a bar. We were really happy to stop by and have beer tasting; they were all very nice! Also, the atmosphere is very chill, there is a terrace where you can enjoy the sun in the afternoon. It's not so crowded."
12,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Indeed the best beer experience in Amsterdam!!! Go for the taster and IPA
13,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Perfect place to drink some beers with friends, very unique place. Recomend taking the tour, so you can learn a bit more about the history of the brewery. One of my favorite breweries of all time"
14,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best Place to enjoy fresh beer. It's very local and good brewery in Amsterdam. Also visit on weekends for brewery tour in English and Dutch language to get more insite. Also available on almost all cafes and bar in Amsterdam. Do try White beer of this brewery very smooth and perfect.
15,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Must visit brewery, overall an amazing experience. Luckily we got a table."
16,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Another one visit to one of my favourite Beer üç∫ places. It is a graphic and so traditional Dutch brewery with her own beers. When you go for the first time you have to take the 5 samples of beers to have in order to taste the most of them. ‚Ä¶
17,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,9 months ago,I‚Äôve been a pretty big fan of the Brouwerij ‚Äòt IJ brews since I moved to the Netherlands (around 4 years ago) and this place has been on my list ever since. I recently moved nearby and had a chance to visit! Its safe to say that I was not ‚Ä¶
18,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very sessionable beers. However then you feel the buzz. Great flavor and not too portent except on the alcohol side. Super awesome Indoors but also very busy. ‚Ä¶
19,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Amazing place to taste a selection of beers and have a meal or a beer-friendly snack while in Amsterdam. The brewery doesn't go unnoticed, as it's located next to Amsterdam's biggest windmill (Molen de Gooyer)."
20,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely, a bit crowded, historical beer brewery with a mill on top of the building. Very peculiar! The food is really good, especially if you want to have lunch with some typical dutch cheese and sausage. The beer is amazing, all of them. I ‚Ä¶"
21,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Staff was nice, the beers were great and it was nice to be able to order a beer taster of three different beers. The food was nice too. ‚Ä¶"
22,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The brewery is located inside an old mill, how cool is that? We went there to sample their craft beers and some starters. Beers were very good, we had a 5 beer sample selection and a plate of sausage and cheese to go with it. Price is ok ‚Ä¶"
23,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Wonderful beer, great environment, but one manager has made our third experience at this location horrible. Tom actually admitted to me that he did not care how customers experienced the restaurant and adamantly argued with me in front of ‚Ä¶"
24,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and rustic brewpub. Relaxed atmosphere and good prices. The Samplers are recommended. ‚Ä¶
25,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Classic brewery experience! They close early so go there in the afternoons. Wonderful selection of beers, amazing vibe"
26,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great local brewery since 1985 with idyllic windmill taproom location. Excellent staff knowledge and selection of styles on tap with more in bottles. Leap day crowd was loving life on a beautiful evening. Cheers.
27,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing craft Brewery.

Built in an old Bathhouse underneath a windmill. Cool setting. ‚Ä¶"
28,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It is a very nice place to hang out. It even has its own windmill. It sells so many type of beer which I regret I only tried one. The combi (cheese blocks and cured sausage) menu was good. The staff was friendly too. It was raining when i ‚Ä¶
29,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good beers but a bit too crowded to let everyone sit and enjoy properly!
30,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect for a refreshing break after walking or riding through the city. Perfect for a beer after work. There is quite space inside and lot of tables outside, indeed It is very busy and caotic but it is worth a visit. The brewery is is ‚Ä¶"
31,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Brouwerij ‚Äòt IJ has various delicious beers and the atmosphere there is very homey! On the weekend it‚Äôs quite busy so if you want to be sure that there‚Äôs seating available i would recommend going there on time. On the inside of the building ‚Ä¶
32,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Impossible to pronounce, but really great microbrewery. Under a large classic windmill this pub showcases their own beer. Really nice choice of different beers on tap as well as many bottles. It was packed with locals when we were there, ‚Ä¶"
33,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place to sit back, relax, have a local beer and some snacks. The atmosphere and ambience is of a cool bar with diverse people sitting and standing around the place. The beer is very good(try different types), and the snacks are to die for(including the surprising boiled egg!)."
34,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"While Brouwerij 't IJ is a wonderful place to enjoy a tasteful beer, one has to like the taste of 't IJ beers because they are a bit particular. Since they had some different beers, including one made in coorporation with a K√∂lsch beer ‚Ä¶"
35,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to grab a few beers with friends. Their brewery has limited snack options, but they go well with the beers. Beer tasting is a good idea before you choose a beer that you like. Local hangout, not so expensive, but a nice location right under the windmill."
36,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars because that could make even more people visit, but I adore this place.  The brewery is one of my all time favorites to begin with, and the bar always brings me joy! Just a happy atmosphere with a very random, odd-couple mix of patrons. Love it!"
37,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is awesome. I went there to try some local beer and the moment I got there I was amazed. The brewery is located besides a windmill that gives the place an amazing atmosphere. ‚Ä¶
38,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best beers I have ever tried!!!!! The ipa is amazinggggggg!!!! As well as all the other beers here! Built underneath an old windmill, how much more dutch can you get? The brewery tour is a little bland and short but man the vibe and the product they produce is A+!! Go go go!!!"
39,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really cool brewery. Great special beers. We did the tour at 3:30. It is a little ridiculous to try to get a spot for the tour. You have to line up outside before they open at 2pm and hope that you get a spot. They don‚Äôt do any sort of ‚Ä¶
40,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome brewery bar with tasty beers. The windmill adds to the picturesque nature especially if you catch it on a good day. The snacks (cheese and meat) are good too. The cheese especially so as it is from the farm that originally takes a ‚Ä¶
41,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice to have a quality beer on a sunny day. Indoors has a subway tile vibe with bench seats and after a few it can be comfy on a rainy day but will mostly be accompanied by tourists. The limited brews on tap is worth a look if you are in the area.
42,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place with gorgeous  beer and tastiest snacks. Ox smoked raw and grilled sausages recommended! For first time take the set of 5 types of beer and then choose the best you like to order again) or even have one more set, its up to you :) i've got sweatshirt and glasses as souvenirs to keep nostalgia in my heart :D"
43,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A must visit if you find yourself in Amsterdam! Works only 2-8pm every day and people start gathering in front even before 2 because there can be quite a long queue at the tills. Amazing choice of beers. You can order a tasting board which ‚Ä¶
44,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place and a must if you‚Äôre a visitor. So many different beers on tap with staff picks and the food is very good. ‚Ä¶

46,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great spot right underneath a Windmil you can enjoy the delicious beer here. Also the food platter is absolutely delicious!!
47,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brewery with large tables for big groups. Well-priced beer and snacks (grilled or dried sausage, cheese). A large patio perfect for when it is not raining."
48,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"BT is ahead of the curve. I first visited 4 years ago when craft brew was just beginning to make its way to Europe. The place has grown since then, but the quality and value has remained the same: an average pour is less than 4 euros; the ‚Ä¶"
49,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Brouwerij het IJ you definitely must Visite, see and taste!!! Several taste of beers, tasty bites for eat and drink.  Kind of Hotspot for locals specially Friday & Saturday. ‚Ä¶"
50,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They brew their own beer and my wife liked the raw oxtail sausage. Its a nice place to visit and just across the street is a shop that has a lot of very good deals on clothes and souveniers. We bought a local artists painting on canvas for ‚Ç¨1.
51,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I just thought I‚Äôd pop in and see what it was all about.  The tour is small yet very interesting and the beers are top class.  Quaint is a word I‚Äôd use for this place. Gets very busy indeed.
52,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Taste and quality and fresh beers was good in this place now it taste not the same as before!,most the staff are good,busy place in the weekends and summer and way far from the touristy places! They changed the size of there glass to bigger glass !"
53,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Definitely one of best breweries in Amsterdam. I am. Sure it is worth tasting their beers. You wouldn't regret every single penny.
54,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great local Amsterdam Brewery. If you‚Äôve never toured a microbrewery, or want to know a little more about how beer is made, it‚Äôs worthwhile to take the brewery tour which lasts about 30 minutes and is available in English and Dutch. Lively atmosphere, and a nice outdoor patio. Try the Sluis beer."
55,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Good beer! They also have good seasonal beer. I even got a pumpkin beer once :)

It‚Äôs a gorgeous setting under a windmill and along a canal. ‚Ä¶"
56,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A gorgeous, large, and very lively brewery bar! I drank great beer, and enjoyed the great vibes around. On a late November sunset, plenty of people were also sitting outside. The fact that we're around a windmill adds a lot of mystique."
57,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful brewery pub with some tasty snacks, under a picturesque old windmill. We tried the sausage and cheese. And then the raw beef sausage. Yum!"
58,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a really awesome spot in a windmill.  Excellent beers and very knowledgeable staff.  This is a bit out of the way but worth it for any beer connoisseur.  I recommend starting with the Zatte and then moving to what you would normally ‚Ä¶
59,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place and beer is excellent. Taster set of beers also available. Appropriate stiff salty and greasy food can be enjoyed and beer can be bought to go. Fairly crowded though, but I guess it is a curse of all great places."
60,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good local beer and nice location. Very crowded during particular times. Closing time at 20:30 is weird :) (i suppose not to distract residents)
61,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We love this place!! Flew in from Massachusetts to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary here as we had such find memories from our last visit. The cardamom beer is amazing and the cheese/sausage/egg platters are the perfect accompaniment.
62,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place with really nice atmosphere and really good beers. On a sunny day you can sit outside on the cool terrace. The place is in an old public bath building converted into a brewery. It is really nicely decorated and its location ‚Ä¶
63,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful atmosphere and beer. Great prices. Can eventually get a seat. Seems very busy, but easy to get a beer and a seat as people cycle through. Also, drinking beer in a windmill is pretty great!"
64,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brewery inside a windmill alongside a canal. What more needs to be said? But in all seriousness, really enjoyed the beers and reasonably priced."
65,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What better place to have a micro brewery then next to the windmill that helps mills the very ingredient for the golden liquid of life. Great place to try craft beers and dine on local Amsterdam street eats and bar finger food. The cheese and sausages are a must try with the beer in hand.
66,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice brew pub with their own beers. It is possible to have a short and generic tour through the brewery.
67,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing brewery in a original windmill. They have a larhe choice of freshly brewed beer, their IPA is AMAZING, a must try. The place tends to get a little crowded so expect it. The staff is lovely and the ambiance great."
68,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Full of joy, youth and a various kinds of beer all kinds. Possible to have beer production tour. Located next to the real wind house - transformed in   living house."
69,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Heel mooi plak. Bij de kanal. Built on the windmill, appears to be one of the most oldest buildings in Amsterdam. Must go place for all to experience the crowd, music and the ambience of the place. The best part is you can buy your drinks ‚Ä¶"
70,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool spot to hangout and drink beer / eat cheese plates! Arrived around 5pm on a Saturday and the place was packed with people of all ages. Went straight to the bar and got a very quick service. Would highly recommend, felt like a local and blonde beer was delicious!"
71,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It comes recommended by locals and rightly so! This is a great little mirco-brewery serving a selection of beers with different influences around the world. My personal favourite was the Zatte. Located just outside the city centre, but well worth the visit!"
72,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brewery, great beers. No table service (totally fine) and snack-ish food only. Service was friendly and immediate. Only reason for 4 stars was food wasn't super great and there weren't very many options."
73,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Brouwerij was total fun. Lovely beer. IPA as well. Cool cheese. Check for the timings. Beer might not be served after 8.
74,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A must visit :) this brewery is fun, has delicious beers and is located on the calmer side of town, in an old windmill üòç ‚Ä¶"
75,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What can I say. Simply my favorite brewery of all time. There is some kind of magical elixir in the beers of this place, guaranteed to have you floating when you leave. The beer is the best straight from this brewery compared to the bottled ‚Ä¶"
76,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Get there early! We got there right when they opened and luckily snagged a couple of spots at the bar because it was jam-packed immediately. It was easy to see why once we tried a flight of their beers; there are a ton of options and all ‚Ä¶
77,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Situated in and around a windmill, this is a great place, popular with both locals and tourists. It has a good range of its own regular beers of various kinds, and usually some specials. Food is restricted to beer snacks, sausages and cheese, but these are good quality and tasty. Highly recommended."
78,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great local brewery to go visit. They sling out large amounts of beer that need to be ordered at the bar. If you want to try a selection of their beers you can get a taster tray. They also sell a small selection of food ranging from sausage to cheese, good for a quick snack."
79,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This brewery was a fantastic experience. We went over on a Friday walking from Amsterdam centraal station and it was quite and easy walk. We got a tour ticket each for only 4.50 euro which included a beer token for the end. While waiting we ‚Ä¶
80,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome brewery/pub. Fantastic to drink in a bar that is part of a windmill. Some really nice beers on tap and great merchandise for souvenirs. The food is pretty decent too. Situated in a really nice part of Amsterdam, it is a good venue to add as part of a bar/pub crawl. Highly recommended"
81,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Good cheese and good beer. Many Spaniards like us. I don't like beer, but I sure did enjoy the cheese. I found it was a bit expensive though. My partner tried the IPA and the Ijbock. Very nice place, I hope we'll be back someday."
82,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lots of choices of beer on tap and bottled. The place is under a mill, very interesting. A must visit."
83,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing beer üç∫ collection and ambiance; tried peanuts ü•ú and üßÄ cheese as well. Reasonably priced
84,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Have you had a drink in a windmill yet? If not, this is the place to go. Great selection of their own beer. The place is usually pretty crowded, but the counter service is fast. Friendly atmosphere."
85,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to try local beers. I visited Amsterdam twice and went there both times. My friends liked it very much too. It‚Äôs a windmill from outside with great atmosphere from inside.
Bears + snacks :)"
86,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really awesome craft beer pub. The fresh IPA has wonderful citrus notes. Totally recommend the food as well. And pretty cool apparel/logo design. Check it out!
87,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Truly one of the best places in Amsterdam for beer lovers. Fantastic location under a windmill and great atmosphere.
This place brings together locals, expats, and tourists under one motto: in beer we trust! And they deliver. Just order some cheese and Worst to go along."
88,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,For the beer lovers the Brouwerij ‚Äòt IJ is a must stop place. It‚Äôs a local brewery operating in a active windmill. The atmosphere is great and the beer selection is even better. ‚Ä¶
89,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This brewery was amazing. I got the flight of beer along with some cheese and sausage. The atmosphere was very welcoming along with the friendly and helpful staff. The beer was some of the best I have had. Would definitely recommend stopping here

91,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great beers! They do a good priced tasting board of beers. Also nice selection of nibbles. Good atmosphere
92,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place always attracts people from all over the world. It is a small brewery which produces excellent specialty beers, and you can try them  in a cozy environment in the mill on the border of amsterdam centre. Ask for a tour through the brewery, they do them regularly."
93,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great selection of beer brewed on site. We really enjoyed Flink - a pale ale with a refreshing taste! Finger food was average.
94,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very reasonably priced beer, with huge selection. Functional brewery based inside a windmill"
95,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great beer,  awesome atmosphere and worth doing a tour in the brewery. Very different from the Heineken experience and super friendly people."
96,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to go for a beer. The IJwit in-house brew is worth trying (we tried 4 of them).  The bar food is satisfactory, nothing special.  The friendly staff, decent beer, and proximity to a cool windmill make for a must-do visit."
97,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Unique brewery that should be included in anyone's visit to Amsterdam. It has a great setup, with cosy outdoor picnic style tables. The real stars are the beers, which are brewed here, delicious and reasonably priced. Try the beer flight if you're not sure which one to try first!"
98,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want to visit a local brewery in Amsterdam, this is definitely a place which you should consider - from my point of view definitely better than the Heineken tour. The beers are very tasty, they offer different styles (pilsner, ipa, ‚Ä¶"
99,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place where to taste several local, home-brewed beers. I don't know which beer to recommend to be honest, because all of them are incredibly supreme. Personally, my favourite is the copper-gold Columbus, the heavyweight with a full and complex flavour."
100,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great variety of clientele. We were here 5 minutes before they opened and about 20 people crowded the entrance when they opened. ‚Ä¶
101,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cool microbrewery at a picturesque location - at a windmill. Great taster board selection. Perfect on a sunny day.
102,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were looking for a brewery next to a windmill and bingo! We found it!! We tried a selection of craft beers, blonde and dark, combined with cheese and hard boiled eggs. Most unique experience!!"
103,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good beer and a variety of snacks available as well, not to mention the beautiful location on the canals and the historic windmill. We could spend hours here! Quite busy and a popular place, we see why."
104,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great little brewery next to a windmill. We stopped in for a drink after it opened for the day. We heard it gets very crowded at night. Definitely seems to be a popular local beer.
105,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to see an old Dutch windmill and also enjoy a beer. The vibe was really nice, and a good escape from town center. You can take a bike taxi here from Central for <10‚Ç¨ (haggle!)"
106,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great beer for a great price.
The finger food are also delicious to eat while drinking and talking away."
107,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The brouwery under a windmill is, for me, a must see (and a must taste) in Amsterdam. They have all their beers on tap for a good price. On some days, the brouwery offers a guided visit that is very informative and fun but also short. ‚Ä¶"
108,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My favorite place to go to with family and friends! The staff is very friendly and down to earth. When it is crowded (and yes this is a tourist hot spot) the staff still takes their time for you and makes sure the atmosphere stays friendly ‚Ä¶
109,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The beer selection is impressive and it's fresh and tasty. Great snacks to go along with it!
110,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Good beer, nice atmosphere and friendly staff."
111,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome local brewery with a great atmosphere. Beers are cheap and there's tons of outdoor seating. Go for a tasting flight and try them all!
112,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best crafted beer in Amsterdam!
It can get quite crowded at night or on weekends/holidays as it is not a big place. But it is definitely worth checking out and a must visit for anyone new to the area. I am giving this a ""highly recommended"" 5 stars."
113,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great place. Delicious beers. The Staff maybe not too much friendly in my case but this brewery is a great way to spend the afternoon.
114,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A great local brewery directly below a large windmill and next to a canal. It‚Äôs a bit outside the main center but this definitely adds to the ambiance. They have a large outdoor seating area that you can chill at. I would recommend getting a flight or sample tray of theirs so you can try a bunch. (5 beers come in their flight)
115,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great afternoon in a nice location. Got the tram from city centre.
Shame I didn‚Äôt have longer there"
116,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Cute place next a windmill. The beers were pretty good. More high ABV beers than I prefer but good selection. The peanuts were tasty. Cheese and sausage were okay. Good service.
117,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Always crowdy, closes at 8 pm but beers are great. Come early if you want a seat."
118,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice place, although very packed. Excellent beers with a nice selection of snacks"
119,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,On a sunny day this place can be very busy but it's worth the visit. The beer is really good and the service is fast even when it's busy. Unfortunately they don't always offer the tasting flight: when it's busy they stop serving it. We'll worth a visit though. The windmill itself is very pretty.

276,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cool flights of beer tastings. We came early-ish to get tour tickets which were are incredibly reasonably priced with beer included. Tours offered daily once in English and then Dutch. Go straight to the bar if you want tickets because they go quickly and there was no  line queue so was a bit chaotic.

286,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A brewery and a windmill!! A little out of the way but definitely worth the trip. Great outdoor area to relax and try some beers with friends. They also offer a small snack menu. No table service but it was easy and fast to order drinks.

288,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"When the sun is out this is a great place to grab a beer. The beers themselves are relatively affordable too! It gets crowded with tourists that want to take a picture with the wind mill, but you also see a lot of diverse Dutch crowd here. Great!"

293,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great brewery located by a canal and a windmill. They have a patio and inside. It's self service but they're quick and have plenty of choices. I recommend getting the ‚Ç¨6 snack deal which is half a sausage and cheese. Theyre both really good. It was so great we went back the next day.
294,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a bit touristy -- you're drinking under a windwind. If that appeals to you, you're going to love this place. Once that excitment wears off the beers are average to good. The food is limited to snacks, which I did not taste.  The bar was packed and I had to push my way through a few times."
295,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Probably the best craft beer in √Åmsterdam. The beer Is amazing and apparently is brewed with an organic process. The prices are quite good and they also offer a combo with five samples for 10 euro. The only detail Is that the place Is ‚Ä¶

297,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down the best local brewery. The bar at the brewery has lost a bit of its charm in recent years, because of expansion and hipsterfication. That is the reason we give four instead of five stars, but if you have never been before you will not know the difference. Best place to taste all that this brewery has to offer."

301,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great place for local beer. The snacks are OK. The best is the grilled sausage but nothing special. Nice location and if the weather is nice seating outside is a must. It had a small tour but if it is crowded (usually it is on the weekend) forget it.
302,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We visit here every time we come to Amsterdam. Great selection of beers and snacks. When the weather is nice, it's always great to sit in the sun and the canal. This place also doesn't brewery tours but we always miss them. Next time!"

307,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent and wide range of beer, good cheese and sausage, all presented in a uniquely Dutch setting. This should definitely be on your itinerary. Gets busy and you can wait to be served at the bar but definitely worth it."

309,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Local brewery, easy to get to on a couple of different tram routes. Located right by a windmill, so a great tourist spot. Beers are very crafty, so break out your checked flannel shirts and grow a beard! Not a late night place, has some bar snacks but no meals. Place adjoining it has some reasonable food options."

Loved the windmill. A local recommended this place to us and it was a wonderful stop during our outing that day!
313,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent beers. Located under the largest windmill in Amsterdam. A bit out of the way so most tourists don't make it but well worth the trip! Not much to see on the tour and the guide wasn't too experienced but the reason you go is to get this excellent beer. You get one free beer with the price of the tour.
314,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice selection of brews and plenty of space to hang out with friends.
315,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent brewery - great selection of beer as well as an incredibly tasty cheese and sausage platter. Only downside are the stairs down to the restrooms, which are steep and seem like a joke against anyone who's had a few :p Definitely recommended!"
316,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The beer here was some of the best I've had overseas, and the staff was friendly and helpful."
317,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice place inside an old windmill and not too far from the city center. The beers are good, the glasses are a bit small for my liking, about 330ml is as large as they do. There is no table service which made no difference to me.

323,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Quintessential Amsterdam experience to enjoy local beers at a brewery that sits side-by-side with one of the last standing windmills. Talk about picturesque. The outdoor courtyard area is a great place to enjoy a beer and new friends. Beers themselves are decent, though not spectacular. Service is friendly."
324,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic brewery with lots of beers. Small kitchen serving snacks (had grilled sausage and smoked sausage). Had the Columbia beer - delicious. Friendly staff too. Watch out for drunk Americans who like to jump the queues (lines)!!
325,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing brewery. How often you get to see a brewery in a windmill?? Fantastic local beers, have tasting flights here and tours. Usually crowded and not enough sitting available. Could use some more variety of nibbles to go with the beer."
326,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful windmill with some great selection of beer offered, mind you that tour closes at 4 on Sundays. The beer selection is pretty difficult as they have lots of different types. On the name of food, only few things are available. And for vegetarians there is nothing except cheese and peanuts."
327,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great beer from a well known Amsterdam brewery at a better than average price. Located next to the windmill makes for a nice view. Too bad it closes early. Check hours before you go.
328,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Good selection of beers. Big place with inside and outside seating (beer garden style) and a beautiful windmill as part of the premises. Design seems to be meant for fitting as many people as possible and not much else. Even when busy you can always find a seat or five.
329,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I have no words to explain how much I loved this place. The taste of beer was simply amazing. I can tell you that I never had such a great beer in my life. This brewery is situated at very serene place next to a windmill. They make organic ‚Ä¶

331,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very fun brewery located in a windmill.  Beers are rather inexpensive and coming here is a great way to spend an afternoon on a nice day! Also try the beer flight (and whatever seasonals/specials they have on) to sample their full range of beers.
332,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer on tap and very tasty sausage and cheese snack options! Outside seating is nice and covered and there is plenty of space inside to sit as well. From centraal station you take the train, there's a 10 min walk but if you take the tram it's right around the corner. Easy to get to!"

344,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great selection of beer and I never waited more than one serving before being helped. Payment by contactless made it all the easier. Just don't go for the Columbus lol - not only is it 9% but also quite sour and bitter.

397,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great beer and nice location. Very busy so don't expect the bartenders to chat with you about the beer options (heard someone ask for a suggestion and get told by the bartender to look at the menu as they were too busy to offer info - was glad I knew what I wanted!).
398,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"What an awesome little jewel of the city. Just enough out of the way so the punters can't be bothered but close enough not to be a pain to get to. Plus on a warm Sunday afternoon you'll be surrounded by locals all enjoying a day off with good beer. Try IPA, my absolute favorite!"
399,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer and snack food, convivial atmosphere too."
400,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ultra fresh beer. Enjoy with fresh cheese served there.
401,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good quality beer for an affordable price. The options regarding food are quite limited , but the beer is so good that you don't care.
Plus the place itself it's quite iconic."
402,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,My favourite windmill in Amsterdam. Great place for great beer. The only possible downside is that they can be very busy. But the long tables give the opportunity to strike up a conversation with locals or tourists.
403,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good beer, but very popular place and it's full of loudmouth tourists because there's a windmill nearby. So if you're after a quiet drink head somewhere else especially as IJbier is now available in any pub in Amsterdam. But if you want the ‚Ä¶"
404,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice bar with great beer. üëåüèº
405,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love this place - great atmosphere and if you have the weather a great place to sit and watch the world go by over a few of their excellent beers. Top tip - get there 20 minutes before it opens to get the best seats outside!
406,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Best price for these speciality beers across Amsterdam (you're buying it from the source). Both inside and outside are comfortable to sit. Just remember, little plates to order and closes early evening"
407,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is in my neighbourhood so the easy access and good times with the regulars makes me biased. As good a beer as you will get in Amsterdam, poured with care and friendly attitude. It's a good place to meet up for a couple of hours."
408,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great settings, really good beer...and the snacks are lovely. The grilled sausage and the raw Ox sausage are a must. Definitely worth a visit, even if a bit outside the center of Amsterdam"
409,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Beers here were top notch and well on par with many of other brewerys i have been too. Unfortunatly there were one to many loudmouth overseas heros at this location which stopped us doing the tour and having another beer. We found the joint next door much more to our liking. Still worth the visit for a tasting paddle.
410,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good beers, amazing meat&cheese platter"
411,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If your in Amsterdam this place is a must visit, great selection of decent enough beers. Get the paddle where you can try a few of them. Plenty of outside seating too if the suns out üåûüç∫"
412,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Go to Amsterdam and drink at a windmill üëç
A good range of different styles all.available at good.prices and also bar snacks. ‚Ä¶"
413,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Great authentic place. Just bitterballen are missing
414,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice beers in a characteristic setting, but extremely crowded. The staff are sometimes particularly brisk, hinging on rude. In the last couple of years, I have avoided going after 4 pm."
415,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great beers and lovely settings.
416,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Brilliant brewpub. Always very crowded and therefore hard to find a place to sit most times. Not a problem if you're one or two people but more difficult as a group. Beer is good and really cheap.
417,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beer was great. Do not expect a lot of food options
418,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Great brewery and trendy hotspot during the weekends in Amsterdam. Not plenty of space inside (and Amsterdam windy weather could be a challenge) but if you score a good day you can sit on the benches in front of the place.
Beers are good and cheap, food is easy Dutch style. Worth trying!"
419,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute place, but beer was mediocre at best. We got the taster flight (10 euro for 5 tasters) and none really stood out as enjoyable. Relaxing atmosphere though!"
420,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Any beer there is a great beer. Kind workers and  a nice postcard pic from the windmill. but no meals, only snacks and apetisers."
421,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Yeah, well the folks you order your beer or snacks from at the counter are not really all that friendly. But, that doesn‚Äôt diminish the charm of the place. I mean seriously. It‚Äôs a friggin windmill! How totally cool is that? And although I ‚Ä¶"
422,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very, very nice beer - my friends and I had the IJ'wit under the sun. It was by far the best beer of this summer. Don't go there hungry, cuz they don't serve any real food (e.g. sandwiches, nachos) but all the snacks (e.g. cold/warm sausages and cheese) here are also amazing!!"
423,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It closes at 8, and the brewery closes at 5. I was 5 minutes late to try their freshly brewed beer. The beer is otherwise awesome. The snacks are great as well"
424,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Fantastic brewery and beer bar, with one of the best beers of Amsterdam at incredibly good prices (less than 3 eur for a full beer). And the building itself, with the windmill, is quite scenic. ‚Ä¶"
425,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The place has good own brewed beer. They have wheat, IPA, dubells and some bock's beers. Foods are only snacks! Cheese, sausage and peanuts.
There a open space for the sunny days."
426,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best bar / brewery that we visited while in town for a few days. Tripels were perfect, IPA was solid as well. Get the cheese and sausage!"
427,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Really cool place to try local craft beer. Ambiance is nice with a huge authentic windmill. Big tables and large crowds. Low prices. Food is minimum just cheese and sausages.
428,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Refreshing brews with a great setting. The food on offer could be better.
429,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Had a tour by a new guide, she was a bit chaotic, but full of enthusiasm and passion for brewing beer. She explained the process very well. Afterwards, I enjoyed the beers, they have great brews and friendly staff."
430,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place to have a beer, and cheap! üëå"
431,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Perhaps my favourite drinking establishment in Amsterdam. Their beer is better than good, and the local snacks are simple and genuine. (I always go for the dry sausage.) Can get crowded."
432,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the first (maybe the first?) local brewers, which maintains this rebel's squatters groove despite the fact that their beers have become mainstream and may be found at many bars in and out of town, as well as in supermarkets and gas ‚Ä¶"
433,Brouwerij 't IJ, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Yesterday, when we arrived at Brouwerij 't IJ we were planning to attend the English guided tour with a group of 9 people. When we got inside we were directed to the bar in order to buy our tickets. ‚Ä¶"
434,Brouwerij 't IJ, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We tried several of the beers here. They were all terrible, to the point of being undrinkable. I consider myself quite the beer aficionado living in Denver and having been to over a 100 breweries in my life, just to give some background to the validity off my opinion, i.e. I'm not a bud light drinker!"
435,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Most beers are <‚Ç¨3 and all are delicious.  Friendly staff, 5 beer flights for ‚Ç¨9, outdoor seating options and local bar food.  Oh and it's in a windmill.  If this review hasn't sold you, I'm disappointed."
436,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The best brewery I visited while in Amsterdam, the beer was great and they had some interesting finger food items as well. Can probably get pretty crowded here at times, but still had a chill atmosphere."
437,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good beer, good atmosphere and snacks."
438,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is the source of the most tasty beer you can find in Amsterdam. Brouwerij t' Ij is a great place to go! Great place where both locals and tourists meet. Make sure you come early,  the last round of beer is at 8pm."
439,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great beer and all around great place. Plenty of seating and the staff was friendly and fast. Always nice to not have to wait for a beer!
440,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Probably one of the greatest spot in all Amsterdam for craftbeer. The place was jampacked when we were there on a Friday afternoon. All kind of clients and of all ages. The place is located under the only remaining windmill in downtown ‚Ä¶
441,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best places to have a great beer (my favourite is witte) with safety. During covid19, they are taking precautions very seriously and pay attention."
442,Brouwerij 't IJ, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Mostly for tourists! Beer is just ok, certainly not the best you'll find in Amsterdam. But, the beer is some of the least expensive you'll find- around ‚Ç¨2.80 per 33cl glass. They offer cheap snacks that are quick to prepare such as ‚Ä¶"
443,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Best brewery in Amsterdam. Top quality beers at very reasonable prices (expect around ‚Ç¨2.70 for a beer, which are often quite strong too!). The brewery is situated underneath a typical Dutch windmill too for a great tourist photo."
444,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the best places in Amsterdam to enjoy beer and interact with the locals. One of the varieties of beer that is available here is called ""Columbus"" and the place is quite famous for that. It is quite strong and bitter but definitely worth trying on a trip to Amsterdam."
445,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Craft beers in the garden by a historic windmill, need I say more?"
446,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Prices are reasonable and beers are tasty. The brewery is unassociated with the windmill upstairs, despite the company‚Äôs logo. I remember enjoying the IPA."
447,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good beer in a traditional setting. Great place..
448,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Place has a nice atmosphere. The interior is simple, but stylish.
The little beer tasters are good size and quality and the cheese/sausage selection fitting the occasion. ‚Ä¶"
449,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A bit touristic but an icon in Amsterdam so what do you expect! Brouwerij 't IJ beer is always good and the prices are reasonable. Good atmosphere and nice old location.
450,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place todo enjoy with more than one beer!!
451,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A brewery which is built in a windmill...u cannot miss it. It has outdoor and indoor seating with lot of beer on tap plus finger food to go with beer. It is normally crowded ...it is self service for both food and beer. Has a chic crowd
452,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best beers in Amsterdam, especially the Zatte!"
453,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice location under an historic windmill. Plenty of different styles of beers brewed in house, good basic but tasty charcuterie and cheese, terrace can be busy on hot days but plenty of seats inside"
454,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I've tried them all. Very drinkable. Next time in Amsterdam, mandatory visit."
455,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice local brewery. Get in early if you want to do the tour. You can order a taster with 6 small glasses, to try more beers. Some of the beers are always on tap (Plzn, Natte, Zatte, IJWit and Columbus), but there are more on rotation"
456,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely beer selection and great snacks. Especially grilled sausage. It poured with rain, otherwise we would have sat in the lovely garden area, with beautiful views of the windmill."
457,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,7 years ago,A lively spot to drink some well crafted brews.  A must-visit for those who are visiting Amsterdam.  The windmill over the brewery makes for some great photographs.  Be sure to eat before coming here or plan to go somewhere after since the food is limited to small snacks.
458,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A fantastic outdoor patio bar that has a great vibe and delicious craft beers.
459,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nothing bad can be said in Amsterdam about Het Ij -  it's a city favorite! Their beers are really exceptional (except maybe a couple of their ever changing experiments) and their bar food is soooo good you will not miss dinner. This cool windmill bar is a must see if you're visiting!!
460,Brouwerij 't IJ, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The beer is average, the facility is poor. It is extremely over crowded. But the staff is pitiful. I interacted with three different bartenders and all were unbelievably rude and this is come from someone who has worked on the other side of the counter. I honestly would not recommend this place at all..."
461,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Located inside an old windmill is a brewery. They serve a wide range of beers. Do try the taster menu which consists of 5 different beers on tap. ‚Ä¶
462,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is very traditional and the bier is of course good, however if you go on a Saturday afternoon is super crowded so you will stay outside (and if it is cold is not pleasant). I suggest to go during the week to enjoy it more."
463,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The beer is delicious and the windmill is super cool. I enjoyed drinking this beer all around the city, but enjoyed the brewery a ton as well."
464,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"They brew a few of my favourite beers ever. That's a fact, the beer is great.
But this place is always far too overcrowded and you can't really enjoy your stay."
465,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A must-stop if you're in Amsterdam. Great beers, lots of outdoor seating. Would recommend biking here as it's kind of far from the downtown area."
466,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer, atmosphere.  Variety of different beer types.  Can buy by the pint or they do a tasting flight.  They also have some snacks, cheese, salami, nuts, etc."
467,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice seating outside if the weather is good. Beer is available in various tastes, so chances are there is something for everyone. Lots of drunk people in the late afternoon though."
468,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, great beer :)"
469,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very friendly brewery with excellent beers. You can sit down and watch the brewers at work or you can sit outside under the trees. They even sell snacks. You can really get lost in here... ;)
470,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best beer in the city. For sure
471,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great beer. Small selection, but everything was great. Their Drogewurst was amazing, but the cheese a bit bland. Would reccomend, and will visit again next time I'm in town."
472,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cool building with great beer and some snacks if you get hungry. It was a busy place but if you are in town weather you like beer or not you need to stop by for a visit. It is not too far away from the city center.
473,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Cool place with a handful of house beer on tap. Beer is good, Zatte is a great tripel but their American styles aren't quite there. Gets very busy on sunny days. Great prices for beer."
474,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious beer, affordable prices. Bar snacks are good. Very crowded but still can find a spot on communal tables."
475,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Crowded at all times. Beer is good but not the best. Service is fast. Good to chill a while in the mill and a nice vista of the channels around. Closes really early at 8 pm
476,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place to take a beer. It's far from the city center but it worst it.
477,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brewery, with even better beer. They have seasonal beers as well. The ‚ÄúGrillworst‚Äù (grilled sausage) is from a local butcher, and it‚Äôs amazing."
478,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place. Really cozy and the beers are awesome!
479,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A little bit hyped, but overall a very nice place to have a nice beer brewed in Amsterdam. It is often very crowded here, so it is difficult to find a spot on the terrace in case of nice weather circumstances."
480,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place -- a brewery in a windmill. Good, but not great, beers.  Gets crowded.  Still better than doing the Heineken tour."
481,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice selection of beer. Had the Dubbelbok which was very nice.
482,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"What a glorious place for a beer. Lovely in summer thanks to the large dehors, extremely packed and sometimes chaotic while ordering, this is a must go for anyone interested in beer culture and a phenomenal location, complete with a real windmill."
483,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice craft ale pub/restaurant/ brewery. Knowlegable and helpful staff with a good range of beer available. Special mention to their milk stout.
484,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A brewery in a windmill, doesn't get much more dutch than that."
485,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome beers and iconic location
486,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had some great beers here, but they closed earlier than I was expecting.  Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed myself here and the workers were friendly."
487,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's Amsterdam, it's amazing! Proost! üçª"
488,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,You are cool. Thanks for beer caps.
489,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great, large craft beer bar in a windmill. Excellent in both winter & summer. Very busy at all times! Definitely worth a visit."
490,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great beer great venue let down by lack of a decent menu. If this place had some decent lunch dinner options pub style food like burgers chips snitzel etc this would be the perfect place to spend an afternoon
491,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great selection of local beers in the lively atmosphere.
492,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I can't compliment the quality of this place enough. Every beer we had was amazing and the environment is unbeatable. I highly recommend that you pop in for a visit.
493,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Best beer in the Netherlands. Especially Zatte and IJwit are really worth tasting. You can also buy their beer to take away and some snacks at the bar. Good atmosphere, but the bar is always filled to the brim and it's hard to find a seat. ‚Ä¶"
494,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best brewery in town! After you choose your beer don't forget to grab some Ox Sausage - that is if you want to indulge the best raw meet dish ever!
495,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome beers, great snack foods for a great price, great indoor and outdoor ambiance. If you enjoy visiting micro-breweries you will not be disappointed by this place."
496,Brouwerij 't IJ, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Terrible bar area hospitality was biggest disappointment of an otherwise amazing visit to Amsterdam. Brewery building gets 5* though. Also, buy some more beer flight glasses it's ridiculous you run out of them so much."
497,Brouwerij 't IJ, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Decent place to have cheap beer. Only issue that I have is that they don¬¥t clean the glasses properly. They just dip the dirty glasses in the same pool of water and then serve it to the customers. Absolute disgrace.
498,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Serving some of the best beer in Amsterdam, you cannot miss this unique brewery. Serve solid bites and have incredible cheap prices."
499,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place with lots of tasty beers for a alright price

507,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious beer, nice snacks, highly recommended! Have seen other commenters mention that the beers are small, they're a decent size and priced accordingly, drink up!"
508,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice scenery on the side of town. Great place for snacks and beer to hang out with friends. This is not a restaurant. It's also self serve. Beer is on point üëå
509,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Outstanding selection of delicious beer that honors both the German and American style craft scenes. Light fare with an assortment of cheese and meats to go with your booze.
510,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great beers and great environment. This place gets super busy so be prepared for that. Beers are an excellent price too (2-5 euros). Highly recommend
511,Brouwerij 't IJ, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We tried two kinds of beer, ijwit and nate. This second one is very good.
The offer of snacks is small and not very sofisticated.
It's clearly a landmark for tourists but the beer is good."

518,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent craft brews for people who really love craft beer. The snacks are good too: try the rosemary venison sausage and the sheep cheese.
519,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place. You can choose a lot of different beer from the world and all it's wonderful. If I came back in Amsterdam, I return for sure here"
520,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Local brewery,  making natte,  zatte, a host of other lesser known beers that are good.  Starting to produce American style ipas, other offerings.  Great nuts.  Good cheese and sausage plates. Outdoor seating with waitstaff."

523,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,A brewery that serves fantastic beers. This is the first place we bring our friends to when they visit us. It's the best way to experience Amsterdam first hand.
524,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"A classic brewery/pub. One of best places in Amsterdam to get good bier! Beware, it is often full right after opening hour during sunny days :)"
525,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brewery but too cosy, tried the IPA with cascade citrus and magnum, nice one, not as hoppy as I expected though. Cheese and salami (Combo) plate was great by the way"
526,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The first brewer that opened for public. Now copied by many, but this is the original. They relocated the brewery itself, but you can still get tours here in the mill and sample the beers."
527,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good atmosphere, wonderful beer and reasonable prices (considering you‚Äôre in Am‚Äôdam). Every time I visit the city I go there, no regrets."

529,Brouwerij 't IJ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Some excellent beers here. They have a stock range of about 10 beers and a couple of one off brews for the hell of it. Well worth a visit.
530,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best beer tasting place in Amsterdam
531,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very good place to have beers. Cheap local beers. Good snacks. Great ambient and if it's sunny even better. Nice view to the windmill.

533,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best brewery I've been to as far as beers. The ambiance is a tap room and the beers are always flowing delicious amber, gold, dark, and ipa stuff. Favorites are Natta and Zatte"
534,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"They make incredible beer with their special yeast. And this is a great location to enjoy, specially if the weather is nice. It has been recently renovated."
535,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great neighborhood brewery with a good selection fo beers.  Lively crowd.  If you're bringing a group be sure to get there early!

538,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great beer and garden under the windmill. The Plzen is great taste, also is the Flink, more fruity. The Combi (raw sausage meat and cheese) is great price and awesome taste. Recommended visit here in Amsterdam."
539,Brouwerij 't IJ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent craft beers in Amsterdam! Their Columbus ""Complex Amber"" is my favorite, a nice 9% hoppy ale.  The Paradijs is a Tripel only available at the brewery, is definitely recommended. The plzen is great, the Ij Wit is just wonderful for a Witbier. The brewery location only had snack type foods, sausage and cheese."

558,Brouwerij 't IJ, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The only good thing is the beer, the staff is super rude. One of the waiters broke a glass full of beer and wet my sandals. His answer: put it in the sun. We went to complain about his behavior and they told us ""go away""."
