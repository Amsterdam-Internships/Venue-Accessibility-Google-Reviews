0,Rum Barrel, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Amazing bar with a lot of cocktails based on rum of course üñ§ would also recommend the warm white russian, it is to die for especially in the colder months! tip: on Sunday it is happy hour and all house cocktails are 6.50‚Ç¨"
1,Rum Barrel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Happy that Amsterdam has a proper rum bar with a good selection. The tiki drinks and ambiance outside on the terrace were nice on a sunny Saturday summer evening. When it started getting dark we moved inside, and also enjoyed sitting at the bar. Would recommend."
2,Rum Barrel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great selection of rum and rum cocktails. Cocktails are made very professionally and contain a good amount of alcohol. Service provided is warm and easy-going, but not the fastest - it was very full though. Can get loud in the not-too-big bar."
3,Rum Barrel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great bar. Elaborate and high quality menu. Very good drinks, delicious food and good vibes. I can only recommend this gem"
4,Rum Barrel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great hidden jewel. Huge selection of rums obviously. But also the food is fantastic. Really laid back place and very knowledge and helpful people working there. Great place for a good run and a cigar in a nice warm day. Oh yeah they sell cigars too. Heated terrace if you fancy it. Recommend
5,Rum Barrel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pretty much a hip place for Rum lovers. It's based on the Caribbean theme. Quite a lot of options available for food and drinks. The staff is pretty friendly and  comes with a long history. A must try is the Tiki Puca Puca. Cool place to hangout with friends but pricing looks slightly towards the higher end.

21,Rum Barrel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place .. I dont know man like they hired cocktail wizards to work here. My favorite is spicey mulata...this cocktail is meaning of life. The only downside here is price... 11.50 for mulata? C'mon guys why are you so greedy?..4 stars for that.

30,Rum Barrel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a bit pricey, especially if you want to drink just rhum. They have a quite large choice and some are quite good too but you need to pay the price for it then. Went there a couple of times for their cocktails though and those are ‚Ä¶"

42,Rum Barrel, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"My first visit I only tried a couple of cocktails. And as their name will probably have told you already, those are mostly rum based. I like rum. But for me the world of rums is not as rich as let's say that of whiskies. But I'm always open ‚Ä¶"
43,Rum Barrel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great cocktails and unparalleled collection of rums. Owner is enthusiastic and knowledgeable and bar has a really nice equatorial vibe. The alcoholic ginger beer is certainly worth a try.

54,Rum Barrel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A different concept to the ocean of G&T/craft beer swilling hipster joints currently on every corner. It's a Caribbean island in the Javastraat!
