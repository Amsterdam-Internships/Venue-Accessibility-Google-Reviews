3,Chocolate Company, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a feel good store.
50 flavors of hot chocolate to drink there or for take away. You can buy chocolate spoons for home as well. I enjoyed a mid size cup of white hit chocolate , because you rarely find white one in regular coffee shops."
4,Chocolate Company, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I wasn‚Äôt sure how the selection process worked with all of the flavors of hot chocolate but the staff was very friendly and explained it.
