0,The Mill, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great little bar. Very welcoming with big personalities behind the bar. A touch stuffy in there, but the crisp, cold beer makes up for it. Lads, ask for toilet roll before you use the loo, none supplied for the gents unless you ask for some."
1,The Mill, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great rock bar where the friendly barmaid (Lotte) lets you contribute to the playlist. Top marks for that and putting up with the difficult locals.
