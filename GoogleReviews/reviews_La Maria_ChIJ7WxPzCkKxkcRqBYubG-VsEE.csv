1,La Maria, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"The bread appetizer and the pizza's were very disappointing, the dough in both was very undercooked. It felt as if the dough contained too much flower and/or wasn't given enough time to rise. Service was ok."
2,La Maria, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Romantic wood hoven pizza place. The pizza is legendary and uses very good ingredients. The atmosphere and the people are great. Definitely one of our hotspots in Amsterdam Zuid.
3,La Maria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute little local Italian authentic restaurant. In my lovely neighbourhood but there's no menu to show you which I love but I couldn't hear the explanation of the dishes and well when you're in a group don't be too loud, no one likes a noisy crowd. But beautiful. Will be back. The fresh bread to start. Ummmm amazing"
