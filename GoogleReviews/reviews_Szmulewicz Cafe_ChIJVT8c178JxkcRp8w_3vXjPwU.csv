0,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Was staying nearby and we stopped to look at the menu outside and they came out to tell us about the specials for the night as well. We had the Sliptong and Steak specials. Both were cooked perfectly and delicious. Had a couple drinks and dessert as well. Was a nice intimate atmosphere and very enjoyable. Would recommend highly.
1,Szmulewicz Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant is located on one of the many inner / side streets in the amstel area (on the opposite side of the canal as the opera house). Its a cosy, quiet and quaint place; nothing fancy but definitely not shabby either. As with most …"

3,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We walked by this restaurant every day to get to and from our hotel and it didn't look like much. We tried it our third night and I was amazing! The food was divine and the service was unsurpassed! The waitress was extremely attentive and …
4,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Straightforward clean and unfussy menu, changes often enough to be able to try most things before moving on to the new selection, as well as the specials board. Nice decor, small with a comfortable atmosphere, but light and bright so one …"
5,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really great find in Amsterdam! Right off the beaten tourist track, but so much better than the larger eateries around it. Looks like a converted house that feels really cozy. The food is served in generous portions, and it is truly outstanding! Try baked eggplant appetizer with honey and goat cheese.... Amazing!"
6,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved the atmosphere, cute little place tucked just out of the way of the crowds. Very friendly and helpful waitress. They had more than just the boring vegetarian basics to choose from, and the lasagne special I had was delicious"
7,Szmulewicz Cafe, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice place to drop in, grab a beer and a croquette.  It is off the beaten path so it is quieter inside the restaurant than those on the canal or major thoroughfares.  I sat at the bar and ate, but the restaurant looked like a good place to …"
8,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great food tucked away down a small street. We had the Dutch snacks which were a great winter warmer, then some pasta cooked better than most Italians!"
9,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Really friendly staff and a good atmosphere, it's also nice to sit outside if the weather's good. If it gets cold they put out blankets and the food is amazing for meat-eaters and vegetarians. Also it's very close to Rembrandt Square. Would recommend."
10,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the French onion soup, it was unique and delicious! All the other food was equally well done, our waitress was wonderful! A good pick for amsterdam where there are lots of choices"
11,Szmulewicz Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Make yourself a favor a come to eat here. Service is warm, place is great and food is worth every euro. I suggest the Steak of Lamb and the Dutch Fried Snacks. Ask also for a Brouwerij’tij beer"
