7,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious! We've just eaten at Kantjil for the first time and loved it! The food is so tasty and great quality, and the staff so friendly. They were two of us - we had rendang, chicken satay, belly pork, stir fried veg, rice and a side - …"
8,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 days ago,"Not a good healthy food, but in hungry was a good option. Low prices, in city center, average waiters."
9,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,a month ago,"It is quite common for Dutch Indonesian restaurants to sell a menu that could comfortably feed a small family as a two person meal. Don’t count on that here, though. In fact, I can’t think of a single other Indonesian restaurant where the …"
10,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great restaurant. The food was good and the prices fair. Good  size portions for what you pay. I came for takeaway during the lockdown. The staff were were helpful.
11,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Was amazing place - food is delicious - price are expensive but for the quality and the sevicie is very worth it
12,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Pretty good Indonesian food in a lovely setting. We ordered a la carte (not the rijststafel) and split four dishes among two which was more than sufficient
13,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Overall ambiance was nice. We got an order of the shrimp rolls, chicken soup and rice surprise. Chicken soup and rice surprise we’re honestly okay but the shrimp rolls were probably the worst I’ve ever had. They tasted like they had been in …"

15,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service:

16,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,a year ago,Kantjil & De Tijger is one of the references of the great Indonesian restaurants in Amsterdam. It's located in a quiet area southwest of downtown Amasterdam. Take the tramaway N ° 2 - 11 - 12 to Spui station and the restaurant is just …
17,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Always a stop of ours when visiting Amsterdam, not many good food options in that city, this place never disappoints and there’s something for everyone on the menu. We send all our friends here when visiting and they always comment on how good it is."
18,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The food was fine but a little pricey. Location is ok. Staff was ok too, not really unfriendly but also not overly welcoming/warm. The Beer was warm though which was disappointing for the price of almost 6 euros per bottle but we didn't …"
19,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Indonesian food. Nice tasty food with a good choice of vegetarian options.  *** The kitchen stops serving at 9pm on weekdays and 10PM on weekends (Friday / Saturday).

We ordered:

21,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The recommended Indonesian food in town. However I still don't think that it really capture the essence of Indonesian dining.
There's a lack of ""kick"" in the spices and it is more of a kind fusion food to …"
22,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Even after returning from lockdown still one of the finest and nicest Indonesian cuisine restaurants in the city centre.
Actually the establishment is looking neater than before and there is a hint of …"
23,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,First time I’ve enjoyed Indonesian food. I’m a fan. The clever mix of flavors and textures made for an enjoyable meal. The staff on the other hand distracted from the experience. Whether they need more servers or more training is for …
24,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food with authentic Indonesian essence in the center of Amsterdam. The price a little bit pricey with the small portion.  but service is good. I wanted to order Kantjil bowl set, which seemed a good deal at the time but I was …"
25,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent indonesian food. I was travelling in amsterdam dor 5 days and we were craving for some indonesian food. We found this on gmaps and had good ratings, so we decided to give it a go. It was very satisfying. The smoor babi and sate …"
26,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved it. Hard to find Indonesian food back home and this matched on par to the better places in the New York area in the US. Good portion size and price . I was also able to get what I now consider my favorite IPA of all time, Lowlander. …"
27,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Rijs tafel - plenty of food, really delicious! If you are in a group, consider to order less. Nice Ambiente, people and staff is really friendly and helpful. It is expensive, as everything in Amsterdam."
28,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An absolutely stunning restaurant featuring delectable flavours of the Indonesian islands, paired with an equally fantastic service team. We had the vegetarian Rijsttafel which showcased the chefs’ clever meat substitutions, underscoring …"
29,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Kantjil & De Tijger is a very nice Indonesian restaurant that we found in Amsterdam. Food is tasty and fresh.
Their service was fast and helpful. …"
30,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"In terms of decor, the place is nice. Service was shabby; my friend and I were sitting on a table for 10 minutes before anyone even came to give us a menu. And then another 10 minutes and us waving at them to come take the order. That’s why …"
31,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ambience: Classy restaurant with a bar. The space is tight as they have packed in as many tables and chairs to maximise the use of space. The toilet was spoilt when we visited and we were told to head to the opposite restaurant to use …
32,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious, authentic, great service, and a local cuisine that is not as well known for tourists. Indonesians have a very long history in Amsterdam and this restaurant provides an exquisite cuisine with reasonable prices to experience the unique flavors."
33,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A wide variety of food on the menu. The shrimp and beef sate are very good. The sauce is on point and the grilled meat have a nice smoky flavor. The ‘pumpkin in coconut‘ is a bit plain. I would recommend the spicy fried rice, tastes much better than the normal white rice!"
34,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely Indonesian food served in a friendly, no nonsense fashion. Quite an extensive menu all told. Busy, so book ahead. Would definitely go again, and looks like most other customers do so too."
35,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Overpriced, understaffed, and horrible customer service. First off, it took over 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us when we walked in, and another 20 minutes before our server came after we were seated. Since it’s a special house …"
36,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good indonesian food, but nothing special. Some day offers and draft beer available. One of the staff was not interested whatsoever and rude, but rest were friendly.Quite a few locals comming here."
37,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A little expensive but worth every penny. Delicious Indonesian food with good service and a nice ambiance. We got a table with walk in at 6:30 but it filled up after that. Would come back.
38,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Food was ok, but disappointed. Rice felt like instant rice and noodles were bland. Bun was dry however, lamb satay was lovely."
39,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place with absolutely fantastic food! Plenty of delicious dishes at a pretty reasonable price, especially considering the location. I'd recommend going for the rijstaffel if you're new to Indonesian food, it's a great way to …"
40,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I found my love for Indonesia and Indonesian food In Amsterdam. This place has one of the best menus I have ever laid eyes on. Everything is homemade and the service is excellent. The prices aren't very expensive either.
41,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was so disappointing. I used to love this place. The local Indonesians used to come and have dinner but now, no such thing. …"
42,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We went to this place based on a high recommendation and it was definitely a great spot to eat in Amsterdam! Would recommend. Pics show it all. The service was good too.
43,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm from Southeast Asia so I'm inclined to compare this to Indonesian food from back home. It's definitely slightly more refined here - being Dutch and all. The food is good though, and not far from the flavor profiles of authentic …"
44,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I absolutely loved the food here. The service was a bit slow but we went here at a slow time of the day (mid day around 3pm). We went with the make-your-own-meal option. You can't go wrong with any of the combinations. Definitely try the green beans and the spicy noodles.
45,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I went to this restaurant for lunch with my friends on advice by our tour guide. The place was quiet. Just a couple of other tables were occupied. The waiters were nice, kind and welcoming. The wait wasn't long for the food. …"
46,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have never thought that I would love so much the Indonesian cuisine.
Unfortunately, we had time to try only one dish.
However, will definitely go again during the next Amsterdam trip."
47,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had dinner here and it was amazing! The portions are quite large and the menu is a bit confusing but the staff is super nice and will walk you through it. Service was quick and quite attentive. You should make reservations, this place is …"
48,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This place is great for a group of family or friends. We ordered each 1 rice dish and 1 protein along with some veggies. It was more then enough food to share. The staff was friendly and helpful and the patio seating was great. We will be eating here again.
49,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Been twice in four visits to Amsterdam and would go again any day. Great vegetarian options with the massive Rijsttafel ('rice table') or individual dishes like spicy mushroom in banana leaf, the iconic satay sauce vegetables or the skewers …"
50,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place for Indonesian food! Best to eat outside and enjoy people passing (when weather allows it anyhow). Good chicken peanut (ajam) and tofu based plate. Service could be faster but overall good.
51,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Lekker! The cheesecake was also a delight. The only disappointing dish was the rendang, it wasn't so tender."
52,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Indonesian food in the heart of Amsterdam. Service was pretty quick and even though I was about 15min too late, the staff kindly kept my spot. Great for solo dining too, but as always with Indonesian food: it is better to share. The …"
53,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The staff is nice and the service was really quick. The size of the dishes were good but unfortunately the food didn’t meet our expectations. For this price could be something more tasty. If I come again to Amsterdam, I am definitely not coming back to this restaurant"
54,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Quite expensive food but so good! (Expect 30 € per person). The beef is amazing and the atmosphere is nice. The waitress explained the whole menu which is pretty complicated to be honest.
55,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the restaurant.  Try their home brand ice tea with lemongrass,  etc.  The rijstafel (ricetable) selections are great sharing dishes.  Some of them have mackerel in them which I don't care for,  but easily avoided."
56,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I have been coming here sinds 1992... but did not visit for at least 20 years.
Has not changed a bit. Still has the modern Indonesian vibe.
Food pretty good, service a bit too automatic pilot."
57,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was tasteless, veggies look like they were frozen and was not salted at all, nothing was amazing though nothing was bad, would not come. Back her"
58,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Very touristic, pricey and the quality of the food is not great. Besides the long waiting time we ultimately could name several other Indonesian restaurants with better quality and price."
59,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious Indonesian food in the heart of Amsterdam. A quite find with beautiful design and friendly staff. …
60,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The place was full so the service took a little longer. But afar from that, it was a really nice place with fantastic Indonesian food and an amazing ice tea."
61,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We went to this place with our friends. The service was decent and fast. The dishes were good. We liked the veggies with peanut base particularly
62,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Like an oasis in a dessert, especially when you are an Indonesian that misses your comfort food. Of course it's not 100% authentic and it's not that cheap either, but beggar can’t be choosy right? :)"
63,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Several times there but the only constant was the cold tee. The dishes were good but small in quantity, you either leave with hunger or pay an extra dish."
64,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Having to wait a long time for any service, food orders and 20 minutes to present the bill. The food was ok, but expensive for what it was esp when the meats were on the tough and dry side, and no chilli oil or sambal . Definitely not like what"
65,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,My first time trying Indonesian food. We had some problems trying to understand what to order but at the end it was good. Comfortable place.
66,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was ok but mostly quite bland, and extremely expensive for what you get. Friendly staff and the satay chicken are the only reason it gets 2 stars."
67,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"When I arrived to Amsterdam a local person told me that Indonesian food is very popular and famous for being one of the best Indonesian foods in the world! The food at this place was good, if you like spicy then it is the right place. There is a great variety of options!!"
68,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the rijstaffel and it was tasty! Plenty of food, no need for starters. Not the cheapest but good and seems to be something of an institution."
69,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for Indonesian food. It was my first time trying it and the food was amazing!
70,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"The location is nice and very close to the metro station Rokin. However, the service is not good. We had to ask to order after 15 minutes we were sitting, to one of the 4 waiters. Plus, there were only 2 other people sitting in the whole …"
71,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great asian restaurant.

Super delicious food. Take a rice plate and you get something from everything. …"
72,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It is very popular and very busy. We got a table at 8.30pm and the whole place was still full. We ordered the meat rijsttafel and while the rendang was a little disappointing, the rest of the dishes were really enjoyable."
73,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food at a very reasonable price! It's right next to a tram stop, smart thinking, so it's easy to jump off grab some take away and jump on the next tram that rolls by. Got some sort of spicy beef and it was quite spicy!"
74,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good food, but slow service, we had to wait a long time for the drinks to arrive and the restaurant was not even busy at that point."
75,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Prices are definitely expensive, a min 2 person Rijstaffel costs about €70. Got the smaller and less expensive one course version which was absolutely worth the money and the amount of food was still enormous!"
76,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Thai restaurant. If you love spicy food ask for extra spicy sauce.
It is hard to eat with that sauce if you are not used to.
Do you dare ?"
77,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had the Bandung Classic for lunch. Portion looked small but it was filling. Satay sauce was delicious.
78,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good portion and value for money. Having some taste of Southeast Asia while not being too spicy. Will definitely come again.
79,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,7 months ago,My favorite destination when I want Indonesian food! Wonderful place!
80,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The place is listed among the places visited in 2018 (long time)

I would like to mention my experience was great, and the food was delicious."
81,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place and good service from wait staff.  Ordered the mixed platter with meat and a local draught beer.  Was very tasty!
82,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It is a really nice place to have dinner - the food is very tasty and the portions are more than enough for one person.
83,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent fresh cookies, the cookies are packed neatly in beautiful, practical packages. Among the most delicious cookies I have ever eaten"
84,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent meal. Totally worth it. Get one of their rijsttafel so you can sample everything (NB: it's a lot of food, I shared it with my girlfriend and we could not finish it)"
85,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 months ago,First time eating Indonesian food. Got the nasi rames and it was incredible!
86,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food! And fast service. We got the meat special, and it was super great and the right amount of medium spicy. Meat kebabs not pictured."

88,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The restaurant itself looks nice and upper class but it's a shame the food isn't
It's not bad but we'd expect a bit more from there …"
89,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,a year ago,We ordered the combination plate which had so much delicious food we were stuffed1
90,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Too much food.  Delicious though,  bring an appetite and a wallet.  If you're doing the rijsttafal do not waste precious stomach space on drinks,  appetizers etc ."
91,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I ordered fried bakmi, the taste is quite sweet for me, the presentation is oke"
92,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,This was actually the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life. It took us ages to get served when we first got in there. The waitress was really new bless her and It seemed management had not given her the training she needed …
93,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,This would probably be the most rated Indonesian restaurant. Its better to reserve before you go on weekends. The food was good. We liked most of the dishes we ordered. 1 less star for the price. I found it very expensive and would have …
94,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We got the chicken satay, spring rolls and pumpkin with noodles. The food was good and the sauces were awesome. The portions though are quite small for the price, consider that when you are ordering. I would say this is definitely a very …"

99,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Really beautiful place. it's this really old Dutch style from back 1900. Definitely worth a visit
100,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best restaurant we tried in our 3-day stay in Amsterdam. Really good food (make sure you try something with peanut sauce), reasonable prices, friendly staff. We have come only for lunch and it wasn't too crowded for any of our two visits."
101,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, good food, totally okay prices, a bit slow service"
102,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,a year ago,We are sooo glad we were told about this place and we are super happy we chose to make this one of our few meals in our short stay in Amsterdam. Of course we got the famous Rijsttafel for 2.  We went at lunch time and since there were …
103,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a great time here last week! The food is always amazing, and it was not too busy in the restaurant. We had a lovely server called Katinka. She was super friendly and overall very good at her job and customer service. We will be back!"
104,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Excellent food. I really enjoyed.❤🇭🇷
105,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was fine, my partner had a better experience than I did. But my main issue was I ordered noodles with 2 additions, chicken and vegetables. The server explained to me that I should get 3 as the portions are quite small. So I did, …"
106,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food of very good quality for fair pricing. A bit crowded and loud. Hard to get in without reservation. So it is advisable to call and book a table in advanced. With large variety of 'rice tables' it is very nice for groups to share different dishes. The portion size is good.
107,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Although I stopped here on a Sunday evening without a reservation, I was fortunate to be seated almost immediately. As a solo diner, I could not order the rijsttafel (only available for 2 or more), so on my waitperson's recommendation I …"
108,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Indonesian food at moderate price level.
Lively place, nice atmosphere and very friendly service. We went there in the middle of the week, still only got a table because we placed a reservation earlier …"
109,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our first visit to an Indonesia Restaurant and a success full non the less. We took the nasi rames and got a big Portion to sample all the small dishes. A reservation would be recommended next time, as the restaurant is as popular as it is tasty."
110,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food in good prices. Almost cried of joy eating Kantjil's Bowl. Bella fantastica!
111,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good Indonesian food, but far from great. Maybe even a bit bland. Very overpriced drinks and ridiculous charges (ex: extra white rice with rijsttafel). Unfortunately, the restaurant is geared towards tourists and not locals."
112,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Very friendly service here!
Food was quite good, but the points are lost because of the price/quality ratio. Better options for lower prices available elsewhere.
Again, very welcoming staff members!"
113,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Rijsttafel lunch menu. 40 min wait, restaurant was not even half full. Rendang was cold and very dry rest was OK."
114,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A little overhyped. This restaurant came highly recommended by both personal colleagues and travel books/websites however my partner and I found the food to be very inauthentic and bland. We ordered their signature homemade tea, which was …"
115,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I used to come here on a regular basis and promote this restaurant to friends and family visiting Amsterdam. Sadly, I will no longer do so. The food is decent but my latest experience has shown me the staff and management does not put …"
116,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious food. Laid back scene. Excellent customer service.
117,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I’d really recommend this place if you’re looking for authentic Indonesian Dutch food. We had the rijstafel (rice table) which is a huge amount of food for the price you pay. Yes, the food isn’t beautifully displayed, but the flavours are …"
118,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food. We had the Lunch Rijsttafel - a nice combination of meat and veggie dishes. The homemade ice tea is great as well. Good service. The girls were attentive and friendly. Nice atmosphere. They have inside and outside seating.
119,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Its a rather large venue so the service was a bit slow. Food was all well prepared, but nothing was as spicy as I would expect for Indonesian cuisine. Not that it was bland by any means, just toned down a bit for my taste (I like spicy). …"
120,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Unfortuntely my experience here wasn't so great. The place was clearly understaffed and the staff that was there seemed stressed. We arrived at 8, got our drinks at 8:30, the starter at 8:45, and the main course at 9:45...by the time the …"
121,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"It was my first time there.
Service was good.
The food was delicious."
122,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Having never tried Indonesian food before, we thought a rijsttafel would be a good way to sample some different dishes. However, most of the dinner rijsttafels in Amsterdam are pretty expensive, so we went for lunch. The food was good. …"
123,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice first time indonesian cuisine experience for us. We didn't have to wait too much, while the waitress was very nice and open to explaining / suggesting the dishes. …"
124,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A table was found for us, despite not booking in advance, I had the home made iced tea drink, and the vegetarian meal, with nasi goureng.
Very large meal, plus a couple  of extras, thoroughly  enjoyable,  but I also …"
125,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Super disappointed. If you know and like Asian food then you'll also be displeased. We were a group of 12, who ordered the rice table and 2-4 drinks each which set us back €50 per person! …"
126,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,We ordered rijs tavel for 2 persons and they brought us food for 4 persons. We didn’t realize that until we asked for the bill. The restaurant didn’t recognize its mistake and we forced to pay for the full amount. …
127,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great Indonesian food, especially the meat. Your table will get full of small bowls of food pretty fast after you order. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Regarding price, I think it is very reasonably priced given its location. Staff are …"
128,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice Rijsttafel full of flavour and choice and not too bad to share between two. Quite pricy but definitely worth it. Had to wait very long for menus to be brought over though although they were really busy, seems like a popular place with the locals"
129,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A good place for quality Indonesian food. Offers a variety of choices that are all well prepared with a friendly and helpful staff to accommodate it all. Coming here with a group is a good idea if you'd like to order a large variety of choices to share with everyone.
130,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is really decent. If you take their specialty set, be ready to get a looooot of food. I'm not sure how fresh are all the ingredients, given that you receive the food really fast but overall it's a nice experience. Cool place to go in group."
131,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We let them know that we don't want any peanuts because of allergy. Surprisingly we got peanut sauce. They handled it very good, but still.. if my friend ate it or tasted it he ended up in the hospital. On top of that the waitress forgot …"

139,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"As far as food is concerned this was a good place. It was highly recommend by the waiter in a cafe. Having just had a apple cake and coffee all we needed was a main course so we ordered from the ""bowl"" menus. Food good but as often too much rice / noodles and not enough meat/ vegetables."

144,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best dinners we had in Amsterdam. You must go! It was our first time trying Indonesian cuisine and this dinner was a standout to us. The portions are big and it's very reasonably priced.
145,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best meals I had in Amsterdam! Once you figure out how to navigate the many menus, you’re in for a treat. Rice platters are popular, or you can go rogue and mix and match your own meal. There’s also a daily, exclusive chef …"

147,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit expensive but definitely tasty and cheaper options are available!

the mini-rijsttafel is more budget friendly (around 18 euro?) and is more than …"
148,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Lukewarm, precooked food which is - as 30€ per Person for a rijstafel  - way too pricy. Too much of side dishes and not enough of the actual main dishes to get fed up by the food you actually would like to eat. …"
149,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious, the personnel are kind and friendly. I made a mistake in my order. I forgot to tell that i was allergic to crustaceans while order a mixture of foods. A staff member  took her time to check each food if traces of crusteans were …"

About the food: heavenly delicious, really. …"
152,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food with a lot of options. You can do a full tasting type menu (there's an Indonesian name for it that starts with an r that I forget) or just solo dishes or a mid-level sampler that's great. Good options for vegetarians and vegans. The drink menu was nothing great, but was fairly standard for central Amsterdam."
153,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One local guide has suggested us this place, and it was indeed good. A true Indonesian restaurant inside Amsterdam (Indonesia is an old Dutch colony). The dish is a unique plate with everything mixed: noodles, meat, fried meat and salad with spices from mid to strong taste."
154,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very disappointed. The food was authentic maybe in its oilyness, but the flavours and spices were missing. We tried 3 different dishes in to go. The only good one was sate. Rendang didn't have much flavour and definitely didn't taste like …"

160,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious Indonesian food, both on the take outs front and the dine in side (in which case the special regional set menu they have is great to try). Have brought many friends here and all are a fan. Delicious meat / egg plant dishes in particular."
161,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic food and great service. It opens at 11AM and I remember us being the first customers in. Thoroughly enjoyed the Indonesian flavors, but it could be a bit steep relative to the serving size. But then again, it's Amsterdam prices."
162,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really poor food. The bami goreng was a real disgusting joke. Dry and no taste. The 2min noodles cup you buy in Asian supermarket are even better. We didn’t finish any dishes. Fortunately, we were not sick. Only good point."

171,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We discovered this restaurant 2 years ago on a previous visit to Amsterdam. The food is excellent and although I'm not a foodie its probably the best Indonesia food I've ever had. I've just eaten there again tonight and was not …
172,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love that they offer lunch rijsttafels, which are a tasty and budget friendly option if you're not ready to spend 30-35 € pp many places charge for a dinner rijsttafel. Great space with friendly staff. The beans in black sauce were particularly tasty."
173,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Solid, spicy and flavorful Indonesian food. Service was spotty, but then we had a large group. Not a transcendent meal - the food was good but nothing incredible, so you come away satisfied, just not thrilled for the semi-high price tag. One of few Amsterdam meals I’d consider unimpressive, but not regrettable."
174,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice modern Indonesian restaurant in Amsterdam center. Friendly service who advised those in our group who hadn’t previously ordered a rijsttafel. Tends to get crowded as it is located directly in the center of the Amsterdam and is popular …

178,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best Indonesian spots in Amsterdam. Great for sharing, both to enjoy a colourful taste party with 2, or to have a cozy evening with a group. Try the homemade ice tea. Also perfect for takeout. Can be busy in summer or at night but waiting 20-40 mins with some drinks is definitely worth it in case you didn't deserve a spot."
179,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice food and love the decorations. would highly recommend, everything was cooked so well and seemed to have so much flavour. Felt sorry for the waitress as she was so busy"
180,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good food and very friendly staff. We had the fish and meat rijsttafel and fried bananas. The homemade ice tea is also tasty.
181,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Service was slow for us but understandable given our huge group size. The food quality was variable but overall good - I found the protein dishes were in general better than the majority-carb dishes. …
182,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,If you really want to enjoy Indonesian food this is the place to be in Amsterdam. Lots of possibilities to choose from. Making a reservation is preferred. There could be some waiting involved otherwise. Nice and polite staff.
183,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I always enjoy eating here. Very professional and nice staff, great food and good looking restaurant. Its a must to reserve a spot as it is usually packed with people."
184,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very noisy and very crowded, good food but too pricey. Also the menu is a complete catastrophe to understand and often times the waitress has to explain how you order. Even so they got our order wrong. Not a place for some romantic two hour dinner."
185,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I found this place ok. Went for lunch and had the lunch meal for 16€. Flavours and food presentation was average, the same sauce is used for the skewers and salad. Had a party of 3 people and forced us to sit in a small table, barely enough space for our bags, and food once it arrived. Doesn’t live up the hype. Wouldn’t come again tbh"
186,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terribly unfriendly and arrogant. I was visiting from Australia and I walked for an hour to find it and it took 10 mins to stand around the front desk only to be told it’s fully booked. There were empty tables everywhere and even if it was …

189,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, and even more if you compare prices to other restaurants (price/quality). I will definitely come back! Not for a high class fancy dinner, but if you spent a day in or around amsterdam and want to eat proper, flavourful food for a very decent price (crazy portions also), this is for you. Also for vegetarians or fish lovers."
190,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good restaurant. A delicious chicken soup. Interesting ethnic food, unusual taste, large portions. We couldn't eat it all, took home. Pleasant service. Average price."
191,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was OK, but far from what was expected. This restaurant was recommended in two of our guides as the best Indonesian restaurant in the city, but it felt more as a tourists trap... And the bill can get high very fast. I do not recommend."

193,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,5 years ago,We came to the restaurant and informed that we ordered a table. We were 3 adults. The host offered a round table that can accommodate 3 people who drink coffee but not 3 adults who came to enjoy lunch. …
194,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Sharing is caring in this classic place.
It you never had a rice table, have it here, where families and friends have gathered for many many years to enjoy. If course due to its size things might feel fast, but a place still looking this stylish and well kept after such time needs to be cherished."
195,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Their infamous Rice Tables were most enjoyable, with many options to suit most every taste. The service was fantastic! This is one of the BEST restaurants I've had the pleasure to eat in. 5 stars!"
196,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Amazing Indonesian food!!! If you're in Amsterdam, this is a place you MUST check out. The menu allows you to put together a meal yourself, similar to salad-bar concept, you can choose noodles or rice, then the type of meat you want, type …"
197,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It has a nice atmosphere. The food was tasty but a bit dry and we had to wait a bit as well, even though it didn't look so busy so maybe understaffed, but they were very professional and friendly."
198,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want delicious Indonesian food, this is the place to go. Service was very quick and the food delicious.  I had the big problem of eating my food so quick because of how tasty it was. You will not regret coming here."
199,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Dont know if it is authentic but the create your own bowl is fantastic. You pick sort of grains, vegetables and some sort of protein. Mix and match your options, you'll probably still end up with a delicious bowl"

209,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent food and service. The food was perfectly spiced and so delicious. Every dish was well prepared. Highly recommend this place!
210,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Tastes are regular. Strange food combinations with the bowls (who would ever mix nasi goreng with gado gado and beef rendang?????). The beef had a good taste but was very dry. I don't recommend.
211,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Food was average. For the price I expect much better quality. They were fairly busy when we dined and it took an hour for me to get a water. Staff were friendly but obviously too busy to give us the best service.
212,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice Indonesian fusion food, have the choice between two fixed menus, and unique drinks and cocktails.
Slightly overpriced."
213,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty Indonesian food in Amsterdam! Our tour guide (Paul from Sandeman's walking tour) recommended it to us, and we loved it! Good value, tasty food, and overall a great place to warm up in the cold winter weather."
214,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Had rice table for lunch.  Food was not really authentic.  Black bean sauce fried beans had no black bean sauce and im pretty sure the beans were boiled. Heard they have a different kitchen for dinner so I am assuming that is when a real chef caters.
215,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,3 years ago,A poor excuse for Indonesian. Way over priced. Nothing tasted fresh or vibrant. Everything was dry. Venue is good but very hot.  Service wasn't bad. Would tell people to avoid at all costs unfortunately.
216,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The service is a little bit slow but in general they are very nice, and also the food is excellent! Good value for money, spicy but you can’t stop eating as the flavor is amazing."
217,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"You can’t really go wrong here. Really nice food, authentic taste (I am an indo). Good location in the centre. Price is ok. I had different experiences with staff so I leave that for your own experience. 4 stars: worth a visit. But make a reservation."

221,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious Indonesian meals served in a pleasant spacious restaurant next to the centre of Amsterdam. And for a reasonable price, believe it or not. The only disadvantage is a very limited selection of beer."
222,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,6 years ago,First time we have eaten at an Indonesian. Not my favourite Asian food (too much soy sauce). Best dish imo was pork with coconut sauce. Service was very good.

233,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice Rijsttafel full of flavour and choice and not too bad to share between two. Quite pricy but definitely worth it.

238,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Poor service. Waited 15 min just to get menus. Food came pretty fast, but was barely warm miking me believe it was prepared some time ago. Very mediocre and not worth the money. Sat 20 min in from of dirty plates while waiting for check."
239,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really poor food. The bami goreng was a real disgusting joke. Dry and no taste. The 2min noodles cup you buy in Asian supermarket are even better. We didn’t finish any dishes. Fortunately, we were not sick. Only good point."

252,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My husband and I spent about 10 days in Amsterdam and got take out from Kantjil-To-Go three times. It was definitely the favourite food of our honeymoon and if we ever return to Amsterdam it will be one of the first places we go back to, I'm sure!"
253,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friends told us to try the rice tables from Indonesian restaurants in Amsterdam, so we found this in search and food was incredible, it's so much and delicious. Unfortunately one of the dishes was missing but we felt the rice table experience."
254,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The takeaway option is more than adequate and tasty. It is also very affordable considering its location. The two people serving there is very accomodating, polite and very patient as we picked our food. Recommended."
255,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,this is a place for a great evening enjoying food and company. Especially if you like Indonesian food / flavours. Tables are a little too small for all the food you get but in itself that's an experience too.
256,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Excellent food, nice atmosphere. The a la carte approach is neat: pick from dozens of starch, vegetable, and protein options, build your own meal. I actually took one of the suggested meals, as the menu was overwhelming."
257,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was very tasty with typical indonesian flavors. The rice table was rich and both Shrimp skewers and chicken were delicious
Service was very kind"
258,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A place that stayed hidden for me too long in the middle of everything touristic. Enjoyed a fair priced complete platter offer with some friends, lasting the entire evening. Got very crowded, so make sure to do reservations."
259,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Ok food, feels a bit too commercial though. The large meals to share (their speciality, apparently) were pretty hit and miss. Some plates were excellent, others were chewy or dry. …"
260,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,1 star for service and 4 stars for the food. We waited 15 minutes for menus or to get any attention and never got our water. The food was delicious we just wanted drinks to go with it.
261,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Taste of Indonesia in the middle of Amsterdam. Amazing food. Do not get fooled and order one set between two people as we had two for four people and still didn't finish...
262,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Extremely delicious Indonesian food. Nice casual atmosphere, great service, even when we had some issues with a sick member of the party. Definitely try to get a reservation as it gets crowded."
263,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I always enjoy eating here when on business trips. My wife joined me recently and she loved it too. Great fun and super-relaxing place to eat.
264,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good serving size for the rice table.  Seems that the food is microwaved- meat is quite tough. The alacarte options look tastier.
265,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Omg, I never had such a bad experience so far in a restaurant. The waiting time is ages, the food is average and the service, they don’t even listen what you want. Better to avoid it."
266,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Indonesian cuisine at it's finest! 😋
267,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Understaffed and poor service. You could cook this at home, honestly! 2 hours for a meal!? Uninspired. Have you been to Asia? This is seriously bland. Don't waste your time, go to a local bar and eat there"
268,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very mediocre. Service was just as bad as the food, waitress was quite rude. There seemed to be a lot a waiters but not many people being served. Overall extremely disappointing."
269,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,The worst Indonesian food I have ever had.The pork was smelly and hard to chew.The vegetables were overcooked and mushy.The rice was dry and very small portion.The variety was minimum and they tried to fill with different tasteless …
270,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Poor service. Waited 15 min just to get menus. Food came pretty fast, but was barely warm miking me believe it was prepared some time ago. Very mediocre and not worth the money. Sat 20 min in from of dirty plates while waiting for check."
271,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"There's plenty of options for vegetarians here, the food was tasty and liking to our expectations, and good food proportion as well. Being a busy place, it's recommended to reserve a table in advance."
272,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stopped for lunch at roughly 1pm..service was prompt and friendly..restaurant was clean...we both chose a rice bowl..one with chicken and peanut sauce one with beans and beef.. both very good, flavours came through nicely..prices reasonable..we recommend"
273,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"A good Indonesia-fusion establishment in Amsterdam. If you want something very traditional get the Bami surprised which has fired noodles, fried meat and topped with a fried egg. Lunch is the better value. Gets crowded in the summer time."
274,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I'm reviewing the takeaway because that's where I go the most, but the restaurant is decent. Tasty and fast Indonesian food. It's not the best or most authentic, but it's not the worst either and the price is reasonable."
275,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent restaurant and our food was lovely, the staff here spoke great English and were really helpful with describing the food. …"
276,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This was my first Indonesian food, so I don't know if the food itself is great, or if Kantjil is great, or both, but I was absolutely impressed.  They're going to be on my list every trip to Amsterdam"
277,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very tasty Indonesian. Try the new Asian high wine, it a nice menu to discover Indonesian food and the reisling wine is really good. Overall good price, quality and service."
278,Kantjil & De Tijger, 2 stars ,5 years ago,I was here on my last day in Amsterdam. It was Sunday and we needed some lunch and I just wanted last Indonesian meal before we left. …
279,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Food was only ok. Interesting experience though.

286,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice enough, but the sweet and sour pork was bone dry from being overcooked and served with a sauce closer to ketchup. Service is slow."
287,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious Indonesian food in a bustling atmosphere. Our waiter was very good at explaining the menu and made our experience wonderful. Would return!
288,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazingly good and really cheap lunches. Well worth the price for taste and quantities. Service is friendly and quick ; perfect for an half day break during shopping.
289,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Awful. Took 40 minutes for the food to arrive while two tables that came after us got theirs. Owner acknowledged that it was late, however didn't even apologize. Food that arrived wasn't even worth the wait."
290,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really delicious Indonesian food. Prepared as though home cooking not mass produced. Lovely decor as well. Highly recommend
291,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Casual Indonesian dining in the heart of Amsterdam.
292,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food but as it gets super busy especially in summer, the service suffers - slow and forgetful servers... but overall the food compensates! Best to make reservations!"
293,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Average food, slow service."

A much needed spicy kick after a week of French food. Feels like home."

298,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Terrible experience. We made reservation and had to wait while there are many tables free. The worst part is receptionist let other groups of ppl in, while he claims we have to wait since tables are not clean.. He seriously upset us and we left without having dinner. Worst experience ever in Europe and first time to leave comments..."
299,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty food at a good price.  The set lunch is really nice if you want to try different dishes.

301,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Extremely good Dutch-Indonesian food. Especially the Rijs Tafel. Great friendly service. A bit pricey, but worth it. Spoil yourself."
302,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,5 years ago,Bad attidute. My husband wanted to change one starter meal (just 6.00 €) and the manager refused to do it. After long disscusion we decided to leave this place. They lose us and 40€ worth ordered meals.

311,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service, food and atmosphere."
312,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Phenomenal food, make sure you have the ""Rijst Tafel"" (Rice Table), you'll get a great selection of different dishes, something for everyone! Come hungry, you won't be disappointed!"

317,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Food is indeed Indonesian taste. Especially the rending. Sayur lodeh is good. Sate is gd. Seller is an Indonesian person. Nasi mining is good as well. Abit pricey though. If in Indonesia is cheaper
318,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good prices and even better food

321,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,4 years ago,Not service minded or flexible (I'm allergic and wanted to change some of the dishes but that was hard for them to change). Very expensive and not that tasty. I've visited better restaurants here in amsterdam.
322,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,5 years ago,It was ok in all aspects. There must be better Indonesian places in town. Nothing to complain about but I wouldn't go back. Plus for the waiters.
323,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Interesting food but hard to understand if you are a first-timer in indonesian food. Some desserts on the menu were missing, but the food selection was still very large."
324,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,AMAZING food and lovely service. good sized portions at reasonable prices. very impressed and will definetely come back.
325,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible waiting time and service... food is quite average, could be found in any Indonesian cantine twice cheaper - not spicy, not tasty, just basic. Avoid"
326,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The Rice Tables were absolutely incredible. My wife and I have called this restaurant the absolute best food we've ever eaten. A must!

329,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very busy. Food good not having had Indonesian food before. Service v good and Belgian beer.
330,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,5 years ago,The worst customer service I have ever received. Two tables received their food before us and when we asked what was happening there was no explanation or apology! Tourists do not visit here!

334,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A decent place to eat with a wide range of different foods. While nothing particularly stands out, if you’re curious about Indonesian food and are in the area, it is probably worth checking out."
335,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice place, good food but small dishes. Service was very attentive and polite , I recommend booking in advance."
336,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food is comme ci comme ça. But waited 25 minutes to order, then 30 minutes to get the food. Then they wronged the wine, wronged the bill. Better avoid."
337,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, by far the best indonesian I've had in Amsterdam so far. Totally recommended!"
338,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Indonesian restaurant in amsterdam.. it has an interesting approach for the seasoning they use. it is an ok place to eat. a bit pricey for the taste.
339,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,a year ago,Place looks nice but Noodles and rice were cold. Service was slow.
340,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good rice table, but have had better. A little lacking in atmosphere but we're not phased by my electric scooter."

355,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good indonesian food. Colonial indonesian food that is, because rijsttafel is the food of the colonial Dutch in Indonesia. But very good food and a must for knowledge about Indonesia food. Very good ice tea also."

362,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Absolutely gorgeous food. Staff was extremely helpful and offered a great service. Would highly recommend it⭐️
363,Kantjil & De Tijger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Someone advised me to try the food there... and to be honest i was disappointed. The staff wasnt friendly at all and didnt help me do a proper food selection...
364,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Really good food, portions are not too huge and therefore it's not too expensive. Ask if you're sensitive to spicy food"

371,Kantjil & De Tijger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"One of the best Indonesian restaurants in Amsterdam. They got a huge menu with loads of possibilities, or just take the rice table!"

375,Kantjil & De Tijger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"good take away with fair prices in the city center :)
edit: I have to take it back about fair prices. Every year they  increase the prices by about 10%, way above the inflation rate, greedy as all in the center."
376,Kantjil & De Tijger, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very overrated , sure not going again. Not delicious food and no further option if you dont like spicy foods."
