When we asked him why it's a small beer he said very unfriendly that it's all they serve here. Don't drink here."
52,Irish pub St. James Gate, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is my favorite Irish place to eat and make sure to visit it everytime I travel. I dream of it when I'm back at home in the US.

60,Irish pub St. James Gate, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice pub in the center of Amsterdam... close to a big plsza, lots of restaurants anf coffee shops. So thete were some loud and not so nice people there. The bear was cold and freshly drafted but quiet expensive."

62,Irish pub St. James Gate, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We only stayed here for one drink as part of a stag weekend. There seemed to be better bars around the square that were considerably more Dutch. If you're into Irish-themed bars however, this is the one for you. Just don't expect anybody there to have an Irish accent."
63,Irish pub St. James Gate, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice staff, a patio for the dummy days in a great square. Plenty of action in the square to enjoy from the pub. They have Guinness so, win! Only tried the deep fried old Amsterdam cheese, which was mixed feelings. Some times more dough and some times lots of tasty cheese."
64,Irish pub St. James Gate, 1 star ,2 years ago,Really bad service. I waited 10 minutes and decided it was faster to just go to the bar and order drinks. The real disappointment however came when I needed to go to the bathroom. They charged 50 cents! Next time I visit one of the neighbour bars.

66,Irish pub St. James Gate, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"don‚Äôt know what the sauce was that they put on my sausage and mash, but it wasn‚Äôt gravy. was pink looking and actually tasted like sick. service was awful, took forever to get attention, too busy looking after the bigger tables. had to go in to pay just so we could leave."

71,Irish pub St. James Gate, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I ordered a Guinness and fries, ‚Ç¨11,50. Gave the waiter ‚Ç¨15 and he disappeared; never to be seen again. I typically tip 20% as a standard but please don‚Äôt assume and take my money.  This was disappointing because I really wanted to like this place. I will not be returning."
72,Irish pub St. James Gate, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great pub food if you're craving some comfort food. I love the chicken and veg pie. Expect to pay tourist prices for drinks.
73,Irish pub St. James Gate, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good food and drink with excellent service. The Sunday Roast special is out of this world. Great views of Rembrandt Square out front with the week's biggest football matches playing inside. It is always a good time at St. James' Gate

Very friendly and openhearded Service - especially Owen! Super! We'll come back! Timo und Irisha"
75,Irish pub St. James Gate, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good location with chilled atmosphere but warning if football matches on it will draw that crowd with limited seating and rowdy crowd watching on the tvs. Handy bar to have a few to start your night..
76,Irish pub St. James Gate, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Bad service. Staff is not nice at all and you have to pay to use the toilet- crazy! Although the bathroom lady says it's normal in Amsterdam. As a local I know it is not. My Coke had no bubbles. When I said it to the servant- they did gave me a new Coke in a bottle. Good solution, but why not the first time?"
77,Irish pub St. James Gate, 4 stars ,8 months ago,It nice place to watch sports while drinking beer
78,Irish pub St. James Gate, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and good food. Good to use as a base to explore Amsterdam centre. Sport on all day. Can sit in or outside. Blankets to cover up if chilly. 5/5"

80,Irish pub St. James Gate, 2 stars ,a year ago,Very friendly staff!! but not an Irish pub and in Amsterdam also not a Dutch pub so ticks no boxes!  better places elsewhere.
81,Irish pub St. James Gate, 3 stars ,2 years ago,An employee in the kitchen/ back of the premises on two occasions could be heard ranting loudly using a lot of profanities. We were going to leave but glad we didn't as the full Irish breakfast was lovely.
82,Irish pub St. James Gate, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The Irish breakfast was okay, if a little overpriced for what I was served. That is without mentioning the 'cheeky chappy' Oirish waiter spitting his dummy out at me ordering a coffee after his return trip to the table with food. ‚Ä¶"
83,Irish pub St. James Gate, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place to have a few beers. Friendly staff. Don't know how the food is as we only had beers ;-)

85,Irish pub St. James Gate, 2 stars ,2 years ago,It's crazy how you have to pay in this pub to go to the bathroom. I understand it's only 50c but as a patron spending money on the meal and drinks I feel the bathroom should be free.

89,Irish pub St. James Gate, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"Although the decor is very nice, for food this place is HORRIBLE! simply horrible. never in my life have I ever had such an awful service and disgusting food for that price. I ordered chicken wings, which some were still too pink and raw ‚Ä¶"
90,Irish pub St. James Gate, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food is delicious. We have struggled to find decent food while in Amsterdam but this place has been so amazing that we have regularly returned. Sit inside because the service is quicker.
91,Irish pub St. James Gate, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice waitress that took care of us when we were there for a couple of hours. Nice place to chat and reconnect with friends in the afternoon.

117,Irish pub St. James Gate, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really disgusting toilets I would prefer a train toilet or the one on trainstations .
The chicken reminded me of the stuff which was laying on the toilet .
The woman was very friendly but the other male persons were really unfriendly and rude."
