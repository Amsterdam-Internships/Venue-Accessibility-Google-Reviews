0,Exit Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Nice place . , cozy one ,, the cheapest shisha .. staff are kind .. parking is free … you can order any food there ,, they serve drinks only … but nice place to work also"
1,Exit Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"One of the most chill shisha place, highly recommended."
2,Exit Caf√©, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"They have a free parking in the building,, always order the exact drinks and sizes,, I order Turkish cofe and he brought a large size i dont know why.. Anyway the Shisha was good for 48 AED."
3,Exit Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"For me, it is the perfect cafe... they serve very good shisha and drinks, while I get the freedom to order any food from outside (they don't serve food).
Prices are very reasonable, and they have a nice outdoor area in the good weather."
4,Exit Caf√©, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Shisha and drinks only cafe. The cafe I okay for serving  its purpose - affordable and quick shisha near home. The negative moment is a strong smoke flying in the air from cigarette and shisha. Better AC and exhosting system  should be installed.
5,Exit Caf√©, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Great place and good shisha with affordable price. But the staff needs to be trained very bad customer service  they just don't know how to talk to a customer and make them feel welcome.
6,Exit Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Friends + sheesha + cards = love ❤️

A big surprise of ""no food available!!"" and the only option is to order from outside resturants!!!"
