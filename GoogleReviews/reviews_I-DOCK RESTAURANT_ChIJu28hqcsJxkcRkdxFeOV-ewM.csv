0,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Good dinner with burger and beer. The hamburger is good, but the steak was too nervy and chewy. In reception they say that lockdown at 20, but at 19,20 the restaurant doesn't allow you to seat to eat. Bah..."
1,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 5 stars ,4 months ago,***** to our waiter COR! He made it a special evening whilst the burgers and frieten were ok and our table we had reserved was given away albeit we were ahead of time. Thanks Cor for a your attention to detail and super nice meeting you! Will be back!
2,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We stayed at the hotel Room Mate Aitana and had dinner at their restaurant I - dock. Very nice hotel and restaurant! We ordered  The spaghett agilloi with prawns, breaded whitefish (I think was flounder) with green mint tea and a kids meal ‚Ä¶"
3,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great place to chill at the dock terrace or inside in a stylish modern decoration. Just a stone away from the Central Station to enjoy a walk next to the water until you reach I Dock. Not crowded as it‚Äôs not in the center. Good cava and delicious food. I recommend the oyster mushrooms bitterballen and the BBQ octopus.
4,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Large and attractive restaurant based in the Room Mate Aitana hotel which is on the articial piece of land called IJ-dok. Great bar and decent food.
5,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Went only to a meetup here. But the design and the ambient lighting was extremely gorgeous and the staff seemed nice! Prices at the bar also seemed fair.
6,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The quality of the food is OK, not much choice though. The staff is friendly, but oh so slooooooowwww, even though there were only 4-5 other tables"
7,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is exquisite at a very reasonable price point similar to much more conventional menus. Imaginative bites of flavour and lovely presentation. Good service. Sharp decor, good view and spacious. Conveniently located 10 mins walk from central station. Will be back (again)."
8,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely and utterly great service. We ordered a three course menu and you could tell the ingredients they used were very fresh. All my compliments to the chef, it was very tasty. And the waitress went our of her way to help us decide what‚Äôs the best to go for the main course!"
9,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, nice setting, slow service"
10,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I attended a conference banquet here.  Beautiful setting and enjoyable bar.  The staff, however, seemed unprepared for our group of ~300 even though the conference organizers had scheduled long in advance.  There was not adequate food ‚Ä¶"

12,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I was not convinced by the food! Especially, if you are vegan or vegetarian, I would not recommend it to you. I am not sure if you can trust what they are telling/selling. ‚Ä¶"
13,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice menu, really bad service. The service almost ignored us and we try to call them a lot. We weren't the only one which had those struggles. It was a big speeddating at the same time but the waiters weren't involved there - no idea where ‚Ä¶"
14,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food looked very fancy, but taste ok. Also the portions were really small. When we got home,  we had a feeling we are still hungry. The restaurant wasn't full but we still had to wait long time for the kitchen.  The service was ‚Ä¶"

17,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Unfortunately the worst experience i have had so far in Amsterdam, completely understaffed place, only few waiters running around trying to help everyone, which makes it very slow service. Food was poor, wine selection was also not so great. 2 stars only for the view."
18,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 2 stars ,5 years ago,I gave this place a two star rating and only because the decore was really nice. Everything else about this place is simply bad. Me and my friend thought we were coming down from our hotel room to a nice and delicious meal only to pay $50 to get a meal that didn't even suffice to an apatizer size portion.
19,I-DOCK RESTAURANT, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful Restaurant and the staff are just great! I had a really great time and I hope to come back more times! The Manager is amazing too, highly recommended!"
