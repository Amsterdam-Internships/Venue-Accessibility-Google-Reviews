1,The Stones, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Fantastic atmosphere and great team, very good location, great option to have a drink with friends and party"

4,The Stones, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Expensive (5‚Ç¨ the Heineken alcoholess small bottle). No price on most of the menu items and when asked about the ""Long beer"" on the receipt, the waiter just answered that it is normal and took and threw away the receipt. Feels like a scam"
5,The Stones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Get in, don‚Äôt make questions about it, you will enjoy :)

The prices, quality and music is amazing, ho there with time, chill and enjoy the ride."

11,The Stones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"On nights when the morning shouldn't soon begin, I sometimes find myself having a beer among young people having a grand time listening to party music, enjoying a drink, smoking anything other than tobacco, and just being in a good cheer. ‚Ä¶"
12,The Stones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there from 10pm till 3am. We had a lot of fun. The bartenders were nice.

18,The Stones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The place has a separated bar and night club. The issue is that the bar feels a lot more like a nightclub than the actual nightclub part. It's quite pricey and very crowded at night. I didn't stay for more than one drink and have no ‚Ä¶
19,The Stones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very loud. But its in the red light district so that is only to be expected. Good beer. Sports on some screens, old 70s music videos on others. The staff was very helpfull and all had lovely smiles."
20,The Stones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great spot, doorman was friendly and the staff were too. Pints of Heineken were great and were typical price as other places nearby. They allow you to smoke inside as well which was great and the tunes were good. Overall great atmosphere"
21,The Stones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place for people who are more than stoned. To loud music, I coudnt even hear my minds don't want to mention about talking. Full of hard lights and fast music. Bathroom only when you pay for it. At least good place when you are drunk and you like to jump whole night."
22,The Stones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice friendly place with music beer and you can smoke weed if you like. Right on the edge of the red light district. It's got a good position and is busy without being too crowded. Nice friendly vibe .

24,The Stones, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"It was a cool place to hang. Until they started to charge .50 cents to use the bathroom. Then I left after that point. (Just to think, all the money I would've spent in this place and it had to end due to some hustler woman shaking down ‚Ä¶"

35,The Stones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best bar in Amsterdam, if you want to have a good time go there with or without your friends, the music is fine for any taste, the place is pretty great so you won't be disturbed by the lack of space there like in the streets of the city or some others bar. Definitely recommanded."
36,The Stones, 1 star ,2 years ago,New bartender throws beer out when you are looking the other way. Then starts yelling at you when say smt about it. Hospitality level is below 1*. Shame as the bar is a nice place.
37,The Stones, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Always had a good time here. The food in a morning is great and reasonably priced, nice sausages!  The dutch guy with the hat who stands at the door, welcoming customers is very friendly, helpful, and even remembered where I sat a few days ‚Ä¶"
