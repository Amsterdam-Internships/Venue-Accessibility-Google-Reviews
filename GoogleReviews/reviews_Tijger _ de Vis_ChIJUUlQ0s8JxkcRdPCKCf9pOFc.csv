0,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious. Baked Salmon is juicy and tender. Sauce super match with Salmon. Side dishes are high quality. Only one little disappeared is not serving draft beer. Overall is perfect and happy to come again.
1,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great spot for some fresh fish. Fish of the day preparation is perfect. Definitely try the cod fritters and if you are like me the pickled herring.  The sauces are good particularly the cream sauce with tarragon dill and capers. Luckily it …

3,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had to come back for their herring. It’s absolutely great. If i moved to Amsterdam, I’ll be here at least 3 times a week. Dishes are priced very reasonably between 3-12€ a plate. Amazing. They have a little fusion ramen. Don’t miss their kibbeling, herring and ramen 😉"
4,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice cosy place in the city centre. We had the fish curry, fish with vegetables and 2 cappuccinos between the 4 of us (we weren't very hungry) and that amounted to about 40 euros. Both dishes were great and the fish was really fresh! The …"
5,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this place. The crab burger or the kibbling are must-haves but you can also make your own sandwich filled with one of many options. The fries are great, skin-on and accompanied by their home made sauces. The sides are so good too and …"
6,Tijger & de Vis, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"There is a huge room for improvements. I'm suprised with their current rating. This place looks nice and the staff is very friendly, but that's all. We ordered smoked mackerel, but received salmon. Main dish was served before soup and …"

Exceeded my expectations!"
9,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I got a recommendation from a friend about it. Great ambience, great food, really. We came for lunch and ordered the salmon salad, crab burger, marinated squid and herring and some shrimp croquette. Now is one of my favorite places in Amsterdam!"

14,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was some of the best seafood I have ever had. The cod fritters and chips were some of the best and freshest pieces of fried fish I have ever eaten. Their Salmon sashimi was perfect. The wine, small atmosphere, and fresh seafood cannot …"

16,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A fantastic low key fish and chips place. It sounds basic but it's better than that. The service is good, place is lovely and the food is amazing. I had battered cod and chips with salad. Seems nice but with a Heineken was fantastic. All for 10 aswell. Will come again"

23,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great fish dishes here. They ran out of fried cod but gave us a few pieces for free anyway. The pickled herring and fish casserole were our favorites. The staff is very friendly and speaks English. Highly recommended for the quality and …

25,Tijger & de Vis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I used to love Tijger & de Vis but I went back last week and I had a completely different experience: food is still good but no tap water (""we don't have tap water"", really? in Amsterdam?!) and informing you when delivering the fish and chips that as the piece was too big they will have to charge 2 euros more. Super disappointed."

29,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This little restaurant is truly a gem in the heart of Jordaan District. The atmosphere is cozy, the staff are very friendly and professional.

34,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"To start off we ordered some kibbeling (battered fish) and garnalen kroket (shrimp croquettes). the kibbeling is to die for; the batter is not too thick nor is the fish overcooked. The same goes for the ganalen krokets, just perfect! Heinekens were €2,50 which is a steal. The kibbeling (which everyone highly recommends),"
35,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had some lovely pollock with crispy fries here. The place has a lovely, cosy atmosphere coupled with friendly staff. But the one thing I recommend coming to this place for are the excellent fish dishes."

40,Tijger & de Vis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My friend and I found Tiger en de Vis on Google and we loved It! It's both a shop and a restaurant. Some of the best fish and chips I've found in Europe. I really appreciated the healther options they had like quinoa salad. And we tried the Dutch famous herring and it was lovely.
