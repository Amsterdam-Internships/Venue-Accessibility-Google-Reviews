Great to see there's a few more friendly staff to help! üòäüëåüèº
I'd definitely come more often if I could pay by card under $50."
1,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"It's been a long time since we have ordered our favourite, combination chow mein with special noodles, special fried rice and lemon chicken. The tastes have not changed. They were delicious! When we want chow mein, we don't mind driving from Point Cook to Tullamarine. It is more than worth it. Five star rating for the food."
2,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Just ok, service was abit off hand. Best dish was the prawns or black bean beef. Honey chicken is watered down, lemon chicken is fake sauce. (And super thick batter fried). Pick something more traditional on the menu to get something a bit better."
3,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Poor customer service and quite rude.Their special fried rice is good and other dishes ok.I find  it ridiculous that they make us pay cash for orders under $50- and even when order is over $50 they sometimes say the eftpos not working.
4,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,2 years ago,Just as bad as all the reviews say. But I knew this going in so I can‚Äôt be mad. Service is uncomfortably rude from that woman. We ended up leaving mid meal. The younger gentleman was nice and tried to smooth it over but I was already ‚Ä¶
5,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The spring roll was saturated in cheap highly used oil. I asked for water, and they brought me a small glass with ambient tap water. The table, tablecloth, floor, chairs feels greasy, old and dirty. The cutlery has been heavily used. The ‚Ä¶"
6,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Like going back in time the decor takes you back, the food is definitely amazing!! I have been coming here for two years and the food is consistently good. This place is a hit  with the locals so be prepared for possible waits if it happens to be a  busy night. But waits are not unreasonable at all."
7,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Love the food especially the vegetables. Prices have increased a lot and customer service can improve. The place is old can do with improvement, there are no toilets if your waiting a while for take away or eating in you have to go elsewhere."
8,Hoi Tin, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Time management serious problem here.  Had to wait for an hour for average food.  They also demand cash when there is an electronic facility.
9,Hoi Tin, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Service not overly friendly, meal quality ok but size quite small for the money.  Probably better of just getting Chinese takeaway price and quality wise. ‚Ä¶"
10,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, well priced casual dining. Don't let the old style decor detour you elsewhere, the food is tasty and service is fast. Well worth a try üëç"
11,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This is a hidden gem. Really tasty traditional Chinese takeaway and dine in. They have a high minimum spend for eftpos.  But the milk bar next door has an atm for those only wanting one dish with no cash. By the time you get the crispy ‚Ä¶
12,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"best special friend rice ive ever had from an asian resturant, would recommend if youre too lazy to cook dinner and feel like abit of takeaway, this is the place!!! people complaining about eftpos? ATM machine right next door in the Milk ‚Ä¶"
13,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Really good old school Chinese food, reminds me of the stuff my parents got when I was a kid. The Mongolian Beef & Tomato Beef are my favorites especially with cashew nuts. Bummer about the eftpos thing though, but the milk bar next door has an ATM & really good home made chocolate treats."
14,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice and affordable place to eat. I had just landed in Melbourne and was craving Chinese food. This was the closest place to the airport I could find. The food was good with adequate portions. Service was friendly.
15,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,a year ago,"Rudest human on the planet, cash only in 2020? you would think an intelligent business would try to avoid handling cash during the COVID crisis?? Hope the ATO gets you good!"
16,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,4 years ago,The worst chinese I have ever eaten. Rice was hard like it has been sitting out for days and then microwaved. Mushrooms were hard obviously dried but not cooked enough. Soup was like jelly. Waited 20 minutes for service then 30 minutes for entree and the list goes on
17,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Arrived at 735pm for dinner, told only take away no dine in. Yet hours are 5pm to 900 pm 4 of us were push out, there attitude was unexceptionable.One star is too much I would give it -5 and that‚Äôs being nice"
18,Hoi Tin, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"We went there to get takeaways, but the minimum EFTPOS purchase was $35.  As there was only two of us, and we only wanted a dish each, we couldn't buy it.  We ended up spending our money elsewhere."
19,Hoi Tin, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food quality not very good. Over priced for what you get. Left one full dish because it was inedible and still had to pay full price. Poor customer service.
20,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is set in the 80's! The decor is out of date, however the food is amazing! Never disappoints! Family friendly and a reasonably priced."
21,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fry rice is a must try dish, even better than some restaurant in Hong Kong.  Chief and waitress are very kind and nice."
22,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"How this place keeps going I do not know, the decor has not changed..... ever , but I so very much love the food, I normally do takeaway, my go to Chinese shop"
23,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Eating take away for over 30years here. Consistently producing take away at its simplest form. Never had a bad meal here.
24,Hoi Tin, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Poor service meal ordinary the fried rice was obviously old and reheated and got the order wrong - no way will go there again
25,Hoi Tin, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not a great experience. Seriously, read the reviews. Food quality was nasty for how much it costs"
26,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,a year ago,Closed without notification  Proberly  will not come here again as the food is not as nice as it use to be and as the other reviews  have stated the woman that works here is rude  and abrupt..and costing more for less quality  food
27,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very quiet restaurant, great food, friendly staff and retro d√©cor. BYO alcohol so if you want an alcoholic drink buy it before hand"
28,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place needs an update and prices average for the area,  otherwise food it self way pretty good. Worth a try."

35,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food , been going there for over 30 years"
36,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nothing special. Take away is best option as service is poor. Food is average at best
37,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,It's good for takeout...but have troubles with phone orders sometimes..they don't speak good english
