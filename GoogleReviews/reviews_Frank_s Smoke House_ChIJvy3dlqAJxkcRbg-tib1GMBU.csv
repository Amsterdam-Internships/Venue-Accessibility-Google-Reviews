2,Frank's Smoke House, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"While visiting from the United States,  we stopped into FRANK'S SMOKE HOUSE. The smoke is absolutely beautiful with all its cured meats. The restaurant is super clean.. The staff was nice.. The menu was not accurate. They only served pre-made deli sandwiches.  We wanted no spreads. So it was a bummer. The sandwich was ok."
3,Frank's Smoke House, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Visited because I discovered I can actually get Smoked Haddock from here, which I want to make Cullen Skink for a Burns Night supper (and I also have a craving for some kedgeree as well). None in stock, so I wasn't able to take any home; ‚Ä¶"

6,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Amazing place. We walked by for two oysters to-go but we had such a nice talk to the owner that we decided to stay.

7,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is awesome and a true gem!  My first time visiting Amsterdam and so I was looking for something that would boast a local feel and resident atmosphere.  Well I found it at Frank‚Äôs Smoke House. ‚Ä¶
8,Frank's Smoke House, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Decent restaurant as the food was only ok. Ordered a smoked meats platter with side of pickled vegetables as a starter and it was all a bit underwhelming. The smoked Duck was excellent though and really stood out. The main course was a ‚Ä¶

But, to be honest I just get the salmon (and the crab cakes). I will have to try ‚Ä¶"
26,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is such a nice place! The smoked wild salmon is amazing. They also have sweets and nice bread. Frank walks around and chats to regular customers. This place deserves a long line in front of the door, but for now I'll enjoy the quietness."

39,Frank's Smoke House, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I enjoyed the food a lot, we were here for Thanksgiving brunch buffet. Sweet mashed potato dish was epic. The turkey was nice but the drumsticks were super rough. The pie was amazing though. I liked the atmosphere."
40,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the smoked fish platter for 1. Hands down the best smoked fish I had ever! The fish had an intense smoky flavour, which was balanced out really well with the pickles and salad. Also came with complimentary bread and smoked butter. ‚Ä¶"
41,Frank's Smoke House, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Everything super good, the smoke fish and beer were splendid. I gave 4 stars just because I felt that the price for the desert were too high; didn't fit the menu. You should go if you like fresh smoky flavours."
42,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service. Great food. Waitress always smiling and having a little chat, giving recommendations that come from the heart.

43,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had diner here twice in one month just because it's so good! The restaurant works both for a quick after work bite as well as a long diner. But most important the food is amazing! ‚Ä¶

45,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We went here for dinner earlier this week and had a three course meal for dinner. The food was so good, and the service was excellent as well, so we decided to go back for a second time before leaving Amsterdam. They also serve their own house beer, which was really good as well.

47,Frank's Smoke House, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a full meal here. Service was fine, food was ok. I thought maybe it was slightly expensive, but this is a capital city so probably to be expected. ‚Ä¶"

my name's philo.
we tried your restaurant last Saturday for the first time and was very happy ‚Ä¶"
49,Frank's Smoke House, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty, the ham was fantastic, and the smoked duck's breast melted in one's mouth. I did not think I had room for a dessert at the end, but my wife and I took one each to try them, and they were both so good we managed to find room for them too. The pace is laid back, so don't come here for McDonald's speed service."
50,Frank's Smoke House, 4 stars ,a year ago,Lot of very good quality product and helpful staff. Watch out that it's quite pricy. But I could find high quality duck breast (smoked) and foie gras. Bread is also very good. As long as you're ready to pay for it. ‚Ä¶

52,Frank's Smoke House, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly guy. Fish and food were good quality and tasty but the kitchen was so slow and inefficient to the point of frustration. It‚Äôs sliced smoked fish and fries. It shouldn‚Äôt take 40 minutes to prep. Portions were also quite small for the ‚Ä¶
53,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great atmosphere and delicious oysters. Happy hour oysters Friday and Saturday is excellent!
54,Frank's Smoke House, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Frank has some real fine food but I was disappointed by the Baltimore crab festifal. Did not like the Crabcocktail nor the crab cakes. Thought the spices used were not right, spoiled the taste of the crab. But probably this is how they ‚Ä¶"
55,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a tremendous experience at FSH where the entire party (6of us) ate food which we all rated as top marks.  The burgers were amazing, the fish and chips special but the speciality platters at this place set it aside from other good ‚Ä¶"

65,Frank's Smoke House, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly neighborhood restaurant/ deli with everything smokey -except the good selection of wines-. But then again, to really enjoy this place to the max, it probably helps to be a smokehead."
66,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place! Lots of smoked fish and seafood varieties. Also the smoked beers are great and also the smoked ketchup! Cute indoor space and nice to sit in the sun when it's out!
67,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just walking around the neighborhood of Amsterdam East we ended up having oysters at Frank's. It wa Friday afternoon so it was happy hour for oysters, 1‚Ç¨ each from 16:00 to 19:00. Service was also good."

79,Frank's Smoke House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Smoke house with a great menu with lots of variety whether you are into meat or fish and great drinks on tap or bottles of wine.

81,Frank's Smoke House, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Very expensive for what it is. The smoked salmon barely tastes smoke. They didn't have duck so proposed chicken instead and charge you the same price, arguing that it's the same... Good deserts."

84,Frank's Smoke House, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Frank's Smoke House is famous in Amsterdam. He caters many restaurants in Amsterdam. In the neighbourhood? Pay Frank's a visit! He doesn't have much seats because most people take away Frank's deliciously smoked fish or meats, but perhaps you're lucky. My favourite are his King Crab Legs!"
85,Frank's Smoke House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We arrived after a flight and place looked very promising , we gave our order and wait...and wait...after 40 mins of waiting we had enough , that's not a service . The food might be great but if you don't care about your custmores you don't deserv it . Too bad"

91,Frank's Smoke House, 1 star ,3 years ago,Tiny toasted sandwich for ten euro and you wonder why the place is empty. Seen some things that our most unhygienic performed by the staff. Time you rethink your concept or within two years franks smokehouse will disappear.
