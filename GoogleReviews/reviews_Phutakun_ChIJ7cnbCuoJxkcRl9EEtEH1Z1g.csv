0,Phutakun, 4 stars ,a month ago,"A small and cozy place in the heart of Amsterdam. Large menu with good choice. Pad Thai was amazing. Fresh vegetables and fresh meat. The soup was average in my opinion. Lacked taste and it was a tiny portion for 6,5 euros. I recommend this place for everyone who loves Thai cuisine."

33,Phutakun, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Came across this quaint Thai place on a side street with wife.  Decided to give it a try for dinner based on its high Trip Advisor ranking.  It did not disappoint. Food and service were the culinary highlight of our long weekend in ‚Ä¶
34,Phutakun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One or maybe the best massaman curry chicken that I have ever tried. It is not in the menu as they offer it with beef but they had no problem to change it. Totally recommended. The portions are a bit small but you can order more rice if needed. Another advantage is that it is open until late and there is no need to book a table
35,Phutakun, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Seated on the worst place with no space and unstable table. Gave order 20 minutes later. Food lacks spiciness and depth we are familiar with Thai food. Overall it was a negative experience and will not visit this restaurant again. There are much better  alternatives which respects the Thai cuisine and culture.
36,Phutakun, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was exceptional, best Thai food I have eaten in years. Amazing soups and seafood dishes. The service was very good and the staff is realy friendly

61,Phutakun, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Thai food goes beyond Thailand, and this is one of the places you can find it!
