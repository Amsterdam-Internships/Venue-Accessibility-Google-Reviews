It is not like other fast food Turkish food you find in the city. This restaurant provides a diversity of rich Turkish cuisine. You can find super delicious vegan and vegetarian food, as well as meat options."
1,Lavanta, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place to taste some Mediterranean flavours, a lot of Turkish and Greek dishes. Meatballs, sarma and stuffed eggplants were very delicious."
2,Lavanta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Turkish food in townüòç I've just moved to the area and have eaten there already so often because it's sooo delicious! The ingredients are all fresh and really nice prepared - I just can‚Äôt resist on the way home. And the staff is very friendly as well :-) Definitively one of my new favorite restaurants in Amsterdam!
3,Lavanta, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"When I miss Turkish food, I go Lavanta (nearly everyday). However, don't expect to have d√∂ner or kebap here. Turkish cuisine is not just about d√∂ner or kebab. It's richer than you think. They have so many vegetarian foods as well, which Aegean area in Turkey is famous for"
4,Lavanta, 2 stars ,2 months ago,Had a very over priced yet very average wrap. They charged the full amount of aubergine wrap - despite missing many ingredients. It was basically aubergine salad wrapped with some lettuce pieces for 8 euros.

9,Lavanta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food that reminds me of home. The ingredients are fresh and the chef(s) put that extra effort in making each dish taste great.

10,Lavanta, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Must have: lamb moussaka! Also, due to corona, they diversified into wraps. Also very tasty! More expensive than regular wraps but totally worth it."
11,Lavanta, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What a delightful surprise. As a vegetarian, I often look for Mediterranean food as there are typical many options. Strictly speaking, Lavanta isn't your traditional Mediterranean restaurant. It is deli style with a host of very fresh ‚Ä¶"
