0,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We had an amazing dinner. We did a 8 course treat and every single one was wonderful. Starting of with a lovely cocktail going over to a nice bottle of wine. The wine prices are super fair and there is a great choice. The service was really …

2,Envy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I have been to restaurants sever smell-plates dishes before, but this is the first one not only has set menu but allow me order the dishes directly. The menu is well selected, great presentation as you could see from the pictures. Good flavor combination, good quality ingredients. The service is very good, too."
3,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,WOW. This is the kind of restaurant that makes me want to go back and delete 5 star ratings I gave to others because these guys just totally redefined the entire scale. Mind blowing creativity and brilliance. So good that I almost want to …

7,Envy, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Inconspicuous place; it looks closed from the outside, so you may miss it completely! Sleek decor and the food is fine-dining. Delicious plates, very tasty especially the watermelon sashimi... after my first taste I couldn’t stop - hence no picture! Friendly and attentive staff. Nice place but nothing exciting about it...!"
8,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A treat for all your senses! Enjoy the many small dishes by going for a 4 or 6 course menu. You will be wowed by all the wonderfull tasts the chefs put together for you.

11,Envy, 1 star ,2 years ago,"50 euro for a meal and this was my dessert.   I asked for gluten free and sugar free, which know is tough, but that is why I decided to spend the money on a Restaurant like this. To charge me that much money for ridiculously small portions, …"
12,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. The wine pairing menu was superb and the combinations with the food was delicious. Excellent place for a romantic night out but also perfect for a little more casual dining!
13,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great dishes, but very slow in the beginning: first course took 40min, 2nd took 30 min more. Once we mentioned that, they sped up though. Very kind and professional staff!"
14,Envy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious refined food straight from the open-kitchen. Spectacle is guaranteed together with the diversity of flavours taking over your taste buds! Per dish there is a complete explanation of the ingredients. A must for foodies, right?! …"
15,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful chefs table dinner for €70. Extremely happy with the food and service.
16,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is ridiculous. All the chefs are magicians. Speechless by the end of the meal. Best meal I’ve ever eaten.
17,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,An amazing lunch in such a cool place!! Do no hesitate to come here!!!!! We dine in very nice places and this is up there. Great food and atmosphere.
18,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Michelin star worthy food at a bargain price. The tasting menu is full of beautiful plating and surprises. Gold dust unearthed from a bed of micro greens, a perfectly poached quail egg hidden under a burger bun, and dessert ends with a …"

20,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious well crafted food with wonderful service. Very modern. Dress code ranges from casual to sleek
21,Envy, 4 stars ,a year ago,The restaurant was easy to find. Interior is well designed. We have make use of the restaurant week promotion. The food has asian/japanese influence.  The chef played with different flavor and used fine techniques for presentation. Its a nice place to visit.
22,Envy, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I walked by here in the afternoon and saw the chef hand-chopping the meat for the steak tartare and knew I had to eat there. The food, the wine, the service ... it was all impeccable. And the place is simply beautiful. The chef prepares …"
23,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had the six servings with wine paring. The food and wine was awesome. The service was excellent and friendly. Highly recommend for couples or small parties trust the chef for the entrees. Sophisticated atmosphere. Not for picky eaters or children.
24,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First thing you notice when you walk in is that everyone there are locals. They even came up to our table speaking in Dutch, which we felt like was a good sign, and we were right. …"

27,Envy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff. The wine is excellent and the food is quite good. However, for this price you expect every dish to be amazing, that's definitely not the case. Four out of five stars!"
28,Envy, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately, not worth the money that we spent. When you go to restaurants like these, the service and experience are as important as the food.
We were celebrating my sister's birthday and I'm seven months pregnant, but …"
29,Envy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We opted for the chef's table with the tasting menu. The food was very interesting, not natural combinations I would have gone for but it's always good to try new things and it was still delicious (just odd!) We did however have to ask for …"
30,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a surprise dinner at the big table right in front of the kitchen. The food was very good - exciting and very delicious. It was good to give a feedback to the chefs after each course. Thank you very much, we had a great evening."
31,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely amazing. Menu is so unique. We went for the tasting menu which is the Chef's surprise. With the wine tasting. It was Michelin star 100%. The staff were so friendly and attentive. Modern decor, on a quiet street. Would definitely return."
32,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent higher class restaurant to try out. Nice variations of food. Especially with the beetroot, white choclat amuse. Service was excellent and great help with the wines. Think the ambiance is a bit less because the restaurant is long but they can't help it though."
33,Envy, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Started off great - birthday dinner; greeted by the host (or manager) who was very friendly. The waitress though (not sure of the name) ruined the experience - gauked at us asking for water, rolled her eyes when we weren’t sure how the menu …"
34,Envy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for small tapas-like modern cuisine.  The dishes are well-conceptualized, and the presentation is very good.  This is not a place to eat to be full (although you could), but more of a place where you enjoy creative food.  Drinks and wine selection is good, too."
35,Envy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We have been amazed by the quality and the finesse of the food. We loved every part of our meal. When the waiter heard that we were celebrating our anniversary, he spontaneously offered us a …"
36,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Envy was simply brilliant! Whilst busy, we were ushered in a romantic table for two and given it was date night for my wife and me, it was just perfect. We elected to go with the ‘Chef’s Easy Selection’ menu. This included 3 mains and …"
37,Envy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We went to Envy for a team dinner, with a group of 30 people, we got 2 big tables at the back which was quite nice.

38,Envy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"the interior is uber fancy/trendy, and my pumpkin soup was pretty good, but i would rather try other places than go back..."
39,Envy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The restaurant is really good, it's recommend by michelin. They serve small portions of food, but everything was tasty. Good selection of wine. The best thing about this restaurant, it's open until 1am. We've got there at 10pm and still were able to eat. Recommend for families or group of people."
40,Envy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The best meal we've ever had. From the cured meats to start, the scallops, steak tartare and risotto main, and without doubt 2 of the most phenomenal desserts I've ever seen/eaten. It was my friend's birthday and they even sent over another …"
41,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent food with great presentation.
42,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellence place to savor Dutch innovation in culinary design
43,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and flavour combinations! If only we knew about this place before.
44,Envy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Overall our time @ Envy was an experience which unfortunately i'm still experiencing.The two waitresses were attentive but seemed overworked however the waiters needed to focus more on serving then trying to woo fellow eaters to spend more. …
45,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The dinner menu is good, a little expensive but is worth it because of the experience. The chic vibe and the extra friendly staff made it feel upscale. The food wanted to be snobby but had some nice surprises! The wines they serve are good!"
46,Envy, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"You expect a wow effect when you see the photos, the menu and the prices. The wow effect never came... Some dishes were just well prepared (you can make a good cod fillet at home!) some dishes looked fancy but the ingredients just do not pair with each other."
47,Envy, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Solid three stars. The food is tapas style, all small plates, and they know exactly how much food to give you. The sausages were outstanding- although it sounds odd, get the Lavender! The dessert was ""chefs choice"" and also delicious. We went on a Monday night around 7:00 and did not have a reservation and it was fine."
48,Envy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Few really good dishes, but overall bad experience. Shabby wine menu, waiters knew nothing more than the “line” they were instructed in giving, massive sedatives in glasses when pouring wine, split mascarpone cream and generally too many …"
49,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was great, especially the butter and the waitress was absolutely lovely...even gave us tattoo recommendations which is probably unusual. The grillo is a great bottle of wine... Especially for their house."
50,Envy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Not good experience. The food is above average but the service was terrible. It took 2:30h from entry to exit where we've waited around 1h for the first dish. Forgot drinks. Everytime we get a dish, the employee rambles about what it is in …"
51,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We sat at the chef's table for full menu with wine paring, we loved the combinations of the menu and world tour of drinks of the wine paring. Very nice experience, and we very much appreciated the attention for the birthday, we will come back for sure!"
52,Envy, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"We were two people to share 10 dishes (incl. a small starter). All dishes where perfectly made. Good atmosphere and good service. Even though it has a Michelin står, we just walked in from the street. But the restaurant soon filled up, so booking a table could be a good idea."
53,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, nice atmosphere.

The value for money is great.  Food is of an extremely high standard in terms of …"
54,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful experience, creative menu warm and friendly staff.  We chose the wine pairing menu with 4 courses, it did not disappoint.   Excellent restaurant!"
55,Envy, 1 star ,2 years ago,Came here with a tiny group to have some drinks and a little bite. Waitress doesn't know a thing about service and it was to much to ask for some food even while the kitchen staff was still there. Ordered a tequilla in a tumblr had to ask 3 times and received it in a shot glass. The vibe is fine but they have to learn a lot about service
56,Envy, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Excellent food, original combinations and premium ingredients.
Unfortunately the poor service provided by the rude and unfriendly waitress really didn't match the overall quality of the restaurant. …"
57,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super good food and nice staff.
58,Envy, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Beautiful food, but extremely overpriced. For a fine dining restaurant the service needs serious attention. Non attentive wait staff with attitude. Better places nearby with food of the same standard and warm, hospitable service."
59,Envy, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Epic food. Small plates (don't call them tapas though. They don't like that) of incredible delicacies. Unless you really have a good idea of what you want, best to choose one of the chef's choice arrangements. I would recommend the one that …"
60,Envy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Loved their presentation or could it be that I'm bias to flowers? (So put some edible flowers here and there and I'm a happy girl :P)  I am definitely someone who eats with her eyes first unlike my boyfriend who is a critical food …
61,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We were for my husband birthday and we try the 8 steps menu.  Excellent  food, with nice pairing wine. The sumiller was very professional with us."
62,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We went here for Easter lunch and found a mostly empty restaurant (fancy lunch unsurprisingly is not a thing in the Netherlands). However this meant all attention from staff and sommelier​ went to us! We opted for the 6 course 'cant be …
63,Envy, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Envy is undoubtedly a catch when you look from the street: the fancy modern kitchen is immediately visible from the glass wall, beautiful lamps and romantic atmosphere. Then you look at the entrance glass door and you notice the Micheline …"
64,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A guaranteed good experience, with incredible food."
65,Envy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"With its open kitchen and 26 glass-fronted fridges beautifully displaying ingredients, Envy takes a modern approach to the authentic South European delicacy shops. …"
66,Envy, 4 stars ,11 years ago,"The food is amazing, and the setting is lovely. Ended up paying 110 euros for two people although we tried to be moderate, so it's a bit expensive. But to be fair, a similar experience at ""The Maze"" in London would probably cost 130/140 …"
67,Envy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nasty greeting by unhappy waitress, with a reservation wanted to give me (single woman) a nasty table and no option although the manager had no problem with an option.  I dislike restaurants where women are treated as second class citizens. …"
68,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"i am so glad my niece found this place. we opted for 4 course meal, chef's choice which blew us away. each dish was a work of art.
we had poached baby carrots with a sauce we couldn't identify. …"
69,Envy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent service and food. We have tried the Easy menu, with the Chef’s recommendations. All plates were very tasty and well designed!"
70,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and good services!
71,Envy, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Most appalling experience with a restaurant in my long dining career of eating out in over 40 countries.
After our party of 6 was seated we ordered drinks and food from ambivalent and …"
72,Envy, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was incredible - highly recommend the pumpkin soup and the mackerel fillet. Nice place, but very dark - personally not a fan, but it's probably great for dates since it seems very private."
73,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were not the demographic for this. We wanted to try something different. The food is excellent, good and calm atmosphere and most importantly friendly staff."
74,Envy, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing place, always got surprised by the amazing food sensation , good wines and wonderful service"
75,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic place but if you expect a large meal I would not recommend it. Its perfect for a good small meal.
76,Envy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. Nice restaurant. They didn't meet my expectations though ... give it  try
77,Envy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Over priced and terrible wait staff.... you can’t just drop plates in front of us every half hour and and consider your job done....there were also maybe 7 tables seated while we were there. I had to ask 3 times for the Cheque so I could get out of there.
78,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great experience - the chef's selection was expertly prepared and the service was on point. Great wine selection as well.
79,Envy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice food, a little bit expensive for the food quality. Could be more creative for the dishes. The wine there is really good."
80,Envy, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very disappointing. Very slow service ( 2 waiters only) and disappointing food. Not worth of the expensive price
81,Envy, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very poor service, waited forever for each of our courses, no new cutlery, tab water unavailable or only in small glasses, not possible to have one 4 course menu and 2 6 course because the ""rules"" don't allow it, staff is inattentive had to …"
82,Envy, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Every dish is a work of art, both in presentation and in the flavour and quality of the food.  Each visit has been special."
83,Envy, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing food but mediocre service. If you don't mind suffering through a few passive-aggressive ""ex-girlfriends"" you'll get some love from the chefs."
84,Envy, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food but very pricey.  Service was spotty, probably because of their annual company party coming up later that night."
85,Envy, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, we're missing some plates on the menu, but overall great dishes withgood texture and presentations."
86,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice menu set. Good wine list. Great waiters.

89,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A must visit restaurant. Great dishes, fast service, nice staff. I will definitely come back."
90,Envy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Some fun and thought provoking combinations. Unassuming and solid service. The beverage pairing was lackluster save two of the choices.
91,Envy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Superb!
92,Envy, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The Food was pretty good but quite expensive for the 8/10 taste. I really liked it anyway and recommend it to wealthier people.
93,Envy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This place is great - great value and quality - the menu is on the safe side - but man the quality is first class - would definately go back. …
94,Envy, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Indeed a very nice presententation of the different courses, but varying quality in tastes/flavours. Understaffed or unattentive waiters."
95,Envy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of our top experiences in Amsterdam. Small and many excellently cooked portions.
96,Envy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We had the tasting menu and it was all fantastic in a great environment - booking in advice is a must.

100,Envy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Classic Italian tapas in a long railroad kind of place, more like a wine tasting bar. Hipster crowd."

105,Envy, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Envy. Where the water is more expensive than beer, cold sliced ham is served as an expensive entrée, service is rude and snobby and has an awful dessert / cheese selection."
