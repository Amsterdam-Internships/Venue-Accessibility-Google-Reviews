0,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This pub is the oldest pub in Amsterdam. I recommend visiting this place if you are interested in the history of alcohol, moreso on the serving on all types of brands, gin, jenever, etc. If you go, make sure to scrutinize the ceiling and walls, bathrooms"
1,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Kept hearing it was the ""oldest pub in Amsterdam"" but that must be bs, right? Anyhow, great place - loads of friendly people locals and tourists shoulder to shoulder having a good time like it should be"
2,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,a year ago,I accidentally walked into this bar on the Christmas Eve. It was filled with people from the neighborhood but everyone was friendly tons foreigner. The beer was good. The unique decoration and the vibe of the bar left me with warm feelings during a not so great period of mine.
3,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok, this is my new favorite bar on Earth. Seriously!  Dark and cozy with gazelligheid for days, feels like stepping back in time. Super classy barmaid. Wonderful music. Delicious bitterballen. Tiny but very atmospheric brown bar that feels so local. If I lived nearby, I'd go every single day."
4,Cafe Chris, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Super quaint bar! Full of locals! The beer is good and so is the jenever! If your a whiskey and vodka drinker this is an interesting taste of both in a shot. The drinks range from 4-6 euros per pint. Unfortunately there's no food, but the …"
5,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Our new favourite local bar!
The host is really nice and the atmosphere is genuine"
6,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Called in here during a short stay in the city. Must be good as we managed to visit Friday and Saturday. Really good traditional brown bar/cafe in a good location. Friday seemed to be a mainly after work crowd but we were certainly welcome. …
7,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A wonderfully relaxing place to enjoy a cold beer and appreciate the history of this bar. Can't recommend it enough.
8,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"LOVE this place! Proper Dutch pub, exactly what I was looking for in Amsterdam while the wife visited the Anne Frank House. Drinking ice cold beer and watching the old boys playing billiards. Bliss!"
9,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Super friendly and cosy little place, great service and fairly cheap beer"
10,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A very nice and cozy bar. The Owner is very sweet and friendly. There were many locals but we still felt very welcome as tourists and enjoyed a few beers, bitterballen and a nice talk with other guests.
The prices are more than fair!"
11,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super friendly staff, great atmosphere and beautiful old bar!"
12,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful very old and traditional bar, very friendly staff and reasonable prices. Only downside is not accepting cards."
13,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"A must go in Amsterdam. It’s one of the oldest pub in the city, but they don’t rely only on that to make money. Good beer with good prices. You could also order drinks, spirits and glasses of wine. They have few snack options. Don’t miss the meatballs."
14,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,5 months ago,A bar from the 17th century that reminds you why bars ever existed. An Amsterdam must.
15,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very cozy pub with very nice staff. A lot of locals and regulars sitting at the bar chatting with the bartender. It's a nice place to go if you want to get away from the touristic places and 'drink like a local'. Nice beer selection. …
16,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had to go in cafe Chris! This place is proper local and after a quick Google, proper old too! It's dark inside but that gives it a chilled vibe. It can get quite busy but you'll find a spot. We sat in the corner and played chess! 2 beers, 6 euro, cheap as chips for the Dam! Funny little bar with so much character."
17,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great Pub! The barman is super friendly. Totally recommended!
18,Cafe Chris, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good for a beer with friends
Relaxed atmosphere and the owners are extremely gentle and nice, but the menu is kept to the minimum, with only few beers and ciders and no food nor stuff like …"
19,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best brown cafe in Amsterdam!
Very cosy and quiet, beautiful small terrace!"
20,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing experience. You get a deep feeling of history together with a great social drinking experience. Phillip the barkeep is funny and great at figuring out how much to chat with each patron. If you like to chat, sit at the bar and chat with Phillip and the regulars."
21,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely little cafe. Sat outside in the sun enjoying cider. I found the drinks to be quite cheap. The lady behind the bar spoke English, but she wasn't overly friendly. To be fair I'm probably going to remember most places in Amsterdam to be rather pleasant, but I think the condition I was in may also influence that."
22,Cafe Chris, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Austeblief! The bar is cash-only, but it has a great sense of history and eclectic decor. Not a huge menu, but they are the type of bar that stocks the special glass that goes with each beer/cider. Cold beer, charming vibe, and tasty snacks at a reasonable price."
23,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,a year ago,Cafe Chris in De Jordaan  has been my living room for more than 10 years. I used to live in De Jordaan .There I have spent a lot of enjoyable nights. Extremely positive atmosphere and nice people. I have a lot of friends in Cafe Chris. I called the guy behind the bar - Sir Philip.
24,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Such a great evening in this pub. Cozy decor with lovely historical touches. The bartender was very friendly and served us many rounds of Bols with a smile. Look out for th vintage cash register!
25,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Honestly. When someone makes the time when it is busy to make sure you have a good time, then the bar staff have done a good job. The kindest bar man in Amsterdam. Credit to him and the team. 9.5 out of 10. Oh wait it's out of 5...."
26,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Authentic brown cafe bar. The real deal. Atmospheric. Good beers and friendly welcome and engaging bar tenders. Tucked away off a main road but worth searching out.

28,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"400 year old café, nice and chill"
29,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent. One of the oldest bars in Amsterdam (1624). Not touristy (except me). Gets lovely mid-afternoon sun. Quiet side street. Nice people. Exactly what I was after.
30,Cafe Chris, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A very quiet, very cozy pub, but they only accept cash and there isn’t a lot there snack-wise. Overall, if you’re looking a for a quiet place to have a drink, this is a really nice spot."

36,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Really cool place. Friendly waiters, locals who say hello if you enter. Good beer, good prices and it's kind of ancient. They've been tapping beer since 1624. Just go there."
37,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have been here many times and once about the third time I went I left my mans bag with my electronics phone ,go pro ,passport ,about 700 euro's when i was thoroughly convinced it was gone I stopped back there for a cold beer and a …"
38,Cafe Chris, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very cozy environment and classic bar to have a beer. You can taste a wide variety of beers in here and you may enjoy the view of Westerkerk. Only cash, no PIN."
39,Cafe Chris, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A really intereating little pub,  very traditional, looks pretty much like i imagine it would have a couple of hundred years ago. A mix of locals and tourists frequent here and its dog friendly too!"
40,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice little place. Thé neighborhood is soooo cosy. We were just outside the bar on the bench next to the wall. Such a good place to grab a beer aside the agitation of the city !
41,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the old bars in Amsterdam. Inside you can still feel the atmosphere of the golden ages. When you are in Amsterdam, you should drink a “Biertje” in cafe Chris!"
42,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I absolutely adore this bruin cafe. It's charming, full of locals, and the owner is super friendly. Definitely order an Amstel and some bitterballen and hang out for awhile. You won't regret it."

46,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Classic 400 year old brown bar - one of, if not the oldest, in Amsterdam - situated in the wonderful Jordaan district. Well worth a visit."
47,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Relaxed, good prices and a nice mellow music selection to accompany the sounds of billiard balls in the background. Dimly lit and most everything is a wooden surface, my kind of place"
48,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super gezellig place. Perfect bar to spend an evening. There’s some snacks (meats, cheese) but not a ton, and cash only."
49,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the best places in Amsterdam to meet real amsterdammers, playing pool and drink great beer. Here you get the full Amsterdam/Jordaan experience, in one of the most historic cafe of Amsterdam."
50,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is totally a locals bar, with it's own cast of characters, but very welcoming. Stop by for a semi-quiet drink if you get a chance."
51,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A classic corner pub with comfortable outdoor bench seating. Dark aged wood interior and of course delicious beer.
52,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,3 years ago,An amazing spot with great history and atmosphere! Be prepared to be the only foreigner. If you're not adaptable you'll stick out pretty quickly as this place is strickly locals
53,Cafe Chris, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little cafe with a very nice owner/barman. In addition, the ambience is good even though there is no to little music playing."
54,Cafe Chris, 1 star ,a year ago,"Small glasses of bad wine, rude service, no atmosphere, s bit too busy real Amsterdam brown Cafe."
55,Cafe Chris, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Only bottled beers are available. Be careful with the final price since menus do not include the prices. Could lead a misunderstanding at the end. Overrated.
56,Cafe Chris, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very old pub with low ceiling and small space. Visited by locals. Good bitterballen, nice authentic Dutch experience!"
