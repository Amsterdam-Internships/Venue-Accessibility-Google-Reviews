1,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a great night out here on kings day. Pianist sang English songs from 80's and 90s and songs were what everyone can sing to. You can also request songs and tip the singer in a bowl on the piano, although he didn't sing our request of ‚Ä¶"
2,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Highly recommend the bar. Great people and great drinks. Extra special dedication goes to Hand and Leon. Thanks.
3,Pianobar Maxim, 3 stars ,a year ago,Very good live musics but cocktails are bit expensive yet it's not worth it and the service in the bar was ok! But what makes the best service is the gentleman(guard) outside is very welcoming and asked how it goes . üëè
4,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I visited Maxim last year with a group and was pleasantly surprised to hear and sing along to such great music. Loved the cozy and pleasant atmosphere and the friendly staff. Their bar has a great variety of spirits, wines and cocktails, though I found it a bit on the expensive side."
5,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow what a bar. Located right near the centre of Amsterdam, this Piano bar might just be my favorite piano bar out of all the cities I've been to. The table is exceptional as is the bar staff. Keep in mind you will have to pay the standard ‚Ä¶"
6,Pianobar Maxim, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A piano man every night. Relaxed atmosphere  a bit pricy  and they charge 50 c  to use the toilet. That is stupid considering you are paying for the drinks. Still a good place to spend a few hours and listen to good music
7,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A great spot the craic was mighty and the piano man is sound as a pound
8,Pianobar Maxim, 1 star ,2 years ago,"They take money to pee even if you have paid o e Gin Tinic 12‚Ç¨ , they charge you for your jacket 1‚Ç¨ in the entrance , so everything you do its with payment. Maybe if I somke outside they will charge me? .. dont come in this place totally disaponited"

13,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, vivid, not too crowded, just like a piano bar should be!"
14,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this place every time I go! The service is always great, with friendly staff and of course amazing live music :) you can make song requests to the pianist, it‚Äôs always a ton of fun. Just remember to bring 50 cents coins in order to use the bathroom... (only downside of this bar)"
15,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved it! The piano player was amazingly talented and we liked all the songs he sang, including the 2 that we requested. Service was also quick with reasonable prices. It was all very well managed."
16,Pianobar Maxim, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Pricey drinks, cover charge to enter and you have to pay each time you want to use the restroom. Music is a bit loud to have an easy conversation but it is still a nice place to visit. Great bar staff and musical talent on display."
17,Pianobar Maxim, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Would have given a much better review, if it wasn't for the expensive drinks and wanting to charge us extra for using the toilet. I am sorry, but if I have been drinking there for two hours then I expect the toilet to be for free...
Otherwise the first pianist was good, the other was so so...  Not worth an entrance fee"
18,Pianobar Maxim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the piano.  Some things irked me.  They made you check your jacket and charged. Then they made you pay for the wash room. It's a bar. Don't invite me in then charge me for being alive.  That said... loved the atmosphere and the pianist.
19,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,If you like piano bars this one is great! I go everytime I'm in the city. They open around 930 but by 1030 or 11 it's rocking. They bring in different piano players from around the world so there's always different talent. Only one time ‚Ä¶
20,Pianobar Maxim, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"We really liked the place, the music and the service. But the music was way too loud. We were only three people in our party but found it hard to have a conversation. We'd have preferred the piano man to turn down the volume or simply play ‚Ä¶"
21,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved this bar. Excellent singer/piano player on Mondays and Tuesdays. Friendly staff and proper piano bar ambience. Great location next to many restaurants. Very good selection of drinks too. Everyone must visit when in Amsterdam!
22,Pianobar Maxim, 1 star ,a year ago,I was and am a permanent customer of Pianobar for at least last 5 years. Came today with my special and dear friends from US for a usual great experience...but...NO...unfortunately...super poor bar service and zero song performance from a very weak piano artist...SO DISAPPOINTED
23,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We came in on a Tuesday night and were the two only guests. The pianist asked us if we had any requests which he happily played. The bar staff was very friendly, and the drinks excellent."
24,Pianobar Maxim, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"You have to pay to get in and then they charge 50 cents to use the toilet! I would be happy to pay more to go in, but it just seems to stingy and cheap to charge for the toilet every time at a bar. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great place, but they really should change this policy."
25,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We visited this bar as two students. Usually waiters and barkeepers know exactly what you could spend and treat you accordingly. But in this bar we felt so welcome and appreciated like in no other bar before! Even though it was a really ‚Ä¶
26,Pianobar Maxim, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This is a nice place. It offers live music. The singer asks the patrons if they want any particular song and he sings those if requested. The crowd here is very open and trendy. You can find people from different part of the world as this ‚Ä¶
27,Pianobar Maxim, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My friend and I were waiting outside the Bar on Kings Day for one whole hour because the opening hours were different on this day than normally. (They did not announce anything beforehand.) When they finally let us in, the doorman asked us ‚Ä¶"
28,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is by far the best place for live piano music! They have great artists from all over the world playing here. Drinks are a reasonable price and the service is absolutely amazing. Make sure your visit in Amsterdam includes Maxim Piano Bar!
29,Pianobar Maxim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice little piano bar in the heart of Amsterdam if you like to listen to piano. All though there are different artist performing. Sometimes some really know how to make the atmosphere. Unfortunately my last several times i was here, the ‚Ä¶"

31,Pianobar Maxim, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The booze is very expensive (and if you're a beer drinker I hope you like Heineken), but the bar staff are friendly and happy to guide you to a decision when you can get hold of them. The standard of music will depend on the piano player, but if you get a good one this is a nice way to wind down after dinner."
32,Pianobar Maxim, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This was the weirdest experience I've ever had. A nice looking Piano bar that demands they take your coat as you go in, as if to say it's a fine establishment. However, it wasn't so fine when you get inside. Heineken is the drink of choice, ‚Ä¶"
33,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic table service and amazing music! We went on a night when Hans was playing the piano, and he played very well and was a pleasure to speak with! Highly recommend if you have a moment."
34,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolute must for an amsterdam visit. We arrived upon opening and the bar lady (adele) let us book a table for later in the evening. Very cosy, special venue, with good wine and reasonable prices for a tourist hotspot. The uk visiting act, ‚Ä¶"
35,Pianobar Maxim, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Very good live music. Great atmosphere but wines weren't great and consumers were a bit too casual for an elegant bar. :p
36,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Live piano music starting at 10pm. Was there on a Sunday night so it was not super busy but that was a good thing IMO. Nice vibe and talented pianist.
37,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"How good of a time you have here greatly depends on the piano player. That said, I have only had one visit (Out of many) that was less fun. When not too busy there is space for dancing. Big accessible bar area, and (elecric) grand piano in the centre."
38,Pianobar Maxim, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Current cover (on Friday and Saturday) is 1 Euro for women and 5 Euros for men). Very small for a piano bar, only one piano in the corner, songs that are neither current nor ‚Äúpiano bar classics‚Äù (and tipping doesn‚Äôt get other people to stop ‚Ä¶"
39,Pianobar Maxim, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Noisy and fun, live piano player who really knows how to entertain. Drinks are great, I'd like to have more bar snacks (you can drink more!) A great way to spend a Tuesday evening and morning..."
40,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Live music, great staff, stop on by you won‚Äôt be disappointed. When I make it back to Amsterdam we‚Äôll be stopping here again. Fantastic and fun. Think the music started after 10pm."
41,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Live music is back on weekends! Great spot to wind down and the end of the week
42,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They charge 1 euro to enter but there's a free mandatory coat check. The guy that plays the piano is really good. Definitely worth stopping by.
43,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,4 years ago,1 Euro entry fee just to keep the riff raff out. Prices are not cheap but reasonable for a bar in the Leidseplein area with live music. Piano bar is quite gezellig (lively and fun). So give it a chance and tip the porter at the door. It is ‚Ä¶
44,Pianobar Maxim, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It costs ‚Ç¨1 euro at the door and you have to check your coat. Live piano music is good. Bar service is excellent.

46,Pianobar Maxim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The pianist was funny, talented and entertaining. Drinks were pricey, but your paying for a 'higher class's experience."
47,Pianobar Maxim, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They want to have 5 euro for entrance! When we entered the bar was empty and the live music was not good. I wanted to go to the toilet and they asked me to pay 0,50 Cent with credit card! When I comlained they were just unfriendly! Can‚Äôt recommend it!"
48,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Romantic atmosphere, great pianist the night I went. 10‚Ç¨ cocktails and 5‚Ç¨ pints make this a good place to go before/after dinner."
49,Pianobar Maxim, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"It was a lovely atmosphere, but not the price lovely for me."
50,Pianobar Maxim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic bar with live music. Last place in Amsterdam where music survives. The whole Amsterdam music scene is totally terminated by left wing politics but this place survived.

52,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing place with live music. Really enjoyable. Just the cleaning lady was rude and unprofessional
53,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Entertaining üëåüèº the pianists are energic with a wide range of song selection.. less seats more space to contribute to the music and dance
54,Pianobar Maxim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this place, I go here almost every time I go out in Amsterdam. The piano man takes requests and there is an amazing atmosphere in this bar with both locals and tourists."
55,Pianobar Maxim, 1 star ,2 years ago,Cover to get in and have to pay for the bathroom each time regardless?  For a bar that was less than half full during prime time on a Friday?  No thanks.

89,Pianobar Maxim, 1 star ,5 months ago,Never heard of cleaning
90,Pianobar Maxim, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A bit pretentious in an area where you really shouldn't. And any place - even on Tuesday night - that (over) charges everything, is really not my type of place. But few seem to mind, so when near and everything else is empty: give it a shot (but only then)"
91,Pianobar Maxim, 1 star ,3 years ago,"3 Euro entrance -> okay
Price of drinks okay -> drinking some cocktails and then ...
0,50 to go to the toilets-> no way -> asking for the tax bill for this -> see picture"
92,Pianobar Maxim, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Not noteworthy by any means. It gets 2 stars because a cat was resting on the piano.
