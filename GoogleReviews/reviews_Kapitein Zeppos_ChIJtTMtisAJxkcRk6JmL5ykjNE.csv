13,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I like this place that I discovered just walking without destination. It's a bit hided and perfect to get away from the crowd. Just a nice vintage curiosity bar. Beer choice is just fine. Possibility to rent apart spaces. Didn't tried the food. We see that people likes to work there. Perfect for a last drink before to hit the bed.
14,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great restaurant with terrace in the city-centre. Even its location, it isn't full of tourist and it's far from the crowds.

20,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and nice atmosphere! The waitress was also very friendly. Only point of criticism: you couldn't really tell whether a dish was a starter or a main course - a different structure for the menu would be a good idea.
21,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice decoration, spacious, comfortable to sit. Most customers are mature and relaxed."

26,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"The service was good, staff is nice and charming. The chips are quite probably the best I‚Äôve tasted so far, the cocktails too are good. The only criticism I can think off is that the hamburger is a bit oversauced, although still very tasty"

35,Kapitein Zeppos, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"When a cucumber gets cut, it's usually a slice. By the time it looks like this, it's been out longer than it should have been. For the price, you'd expect better quality."

56,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved this place. Hidden gem down a quaint narrow alley. Cosy. Friendly. Efficient. Delicious apple pie üòã. We returned, as we enjoyed it so much. Was very popular and so difficult to get seated sometimes."
57,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great tasting food and helpful service team who explained the menu options. Slightly challenging when busy, as the food is fresh, tasty and so popular that they sell out quickly, even though it was only Monday. We will definitely be back"

61,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely love the vibe of the street where it is located, with all the greenery, and the restaurant blends in just perfectly! The live shows are a plus - once watched a performance on Fado, it was a great experience. And this is the first ‚Ä¶"
62,Kapitein Zeppos, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been here before and enjoyed it. However, on my most recent visit I thought prices were a little too steep (esp for a small glass of wine - equivalent to a full bottle from a shop) and the food was less than mediocre. To the Chef's credit he knocked the price of one of the meals off the bill."
63,Kapitein Zeppos, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Fries were cold, steak was cold, half of it was fat. Was no where near a 26‚Ç¨ rib eye steak quality. We were seated near the window that was looking into the kitchen and saw several waiters take French fries from plates and dip in the main ‚Ä¶"

65,Kapitein Zeppos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A nice and a bit hidden bar with very gezellig ambiance. Staff is very friendly and they usually have a good choice of craft beers and gin and tonic. Bitterballen there are also quite good. Nice terrace on summer too.
66,Kapitein Zeppos, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice 1920-1950 atmosphere with great decoration and helpful staff, found in a hidden alley away from the busy center (gebed zonder end; the prayer without ending). Good selection of beers other liquor, combined with great food. ‚Ä¶"
67,Kapitein Zeppos, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy restaurant with nice atmosphere. Good menu with variation in main courses. However they do not really have appetizers on the menu. Busy place, reserve ahead. Service can be a bit slow when busy."
68,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The sea bass was done just right and it's a nice relaxing vibe. They worked us in on a Friday night without a reservation. We will call ahead to reserve next time.
69,Kapitein Zeppos, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fascinating cafe / restaurant in a back street of Amsterdam. We only wanted hot chocolate, but were impressed with friendly welcome and service. Good level access for wheelchair users."
70,Kapitein Zeppos, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Location is awesome, in a cute little alley where they also have a terrace and an interesting decoration inside. The food is ok but nothing spectacular. The service is very friendly. The place had been there for ages and I would definitely recommend going there."
71,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,a year ago,Such a nice outdoor dining experience very romantic and beautiful with all the plants tucked away in a secret ally. The food is pretty pricey though.
72,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In the centre of Amsterdam, hidden in a narrow alley, this pub is fantastic. If you're lucky a sing a song festival takes place. The restaurant is great and try the fish plate. It's the weekly meeting place of the most relaxed Rotaryclub of the earth: N8W8 (nachtwacht, nightwatch)."
73,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place in the center of Amsterdam, in a small alley, out of sight of the main street. The terrace is really nice and the atmosphere just what is needed to spend a good evening. The food was ok, and the service was fast."
74,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quiet, charming ambiance along a quiet alley; welcoming decor inside.  Visited on several occasions while staying nearby in Amsterdam.  Captain Zeppo produces musicals the first Sunday of the month at the Tobacco Theatre text door..
Be an Amsterdam insider and don't forget the amazing fig salad."
75,Kapitein Zeppos, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food poisoning after their Tuna Steak!!!! Don‚Äôt go there!!! We thought at first - it is cooked wrongly, because tuna steak should be pink inside.

79,Kapitein Zeppos, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was good, the croquettes were very expensive(~8‚Ç¨) for what you get: 3 small croquettes with a side of bread. The focaccia with goat cheese and peppers was delicious. The toilets were very clean."
80,Kapitein Zeppos, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Had a great lunch here! And the staff are very friendly
81,Kapitein Zeppos, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Average, average, average. Everything was average. The sand which I got I probably could have made at home and it would have tasted just as good.
