32,Maxies, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I only give 4 stars because it's not quite a complete replica of New Orleans cuisine. However the food itself is very delicious indeed. We had the BBQ shrimp, red beans and rice, brisket and Frogmore stew. The red beans and rice and stew …"
33,Maxies, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Run by Black Shoe Hospitality so you already know it's good. Don't even need to talk about the food, I'm sure it's all good. Upstairs is cool, very well segmented so you have some personal space. I recommend the oyster shot ;)"
34,Maxies, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Waiter was great. Food not very good. Some was cold. Ribs had too much sauce, dry & poor quality as well as burnt on back side. The Me oh My was good and a large portion. This not the Maxie's I remember from a year ago. Would not recommend nor return."

40,Maxies, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"This place has excellent food and our server, Nicole, could not have been better. That being said, after being open for only 1 hour they had already run out of fried chicken and the dessert we wanted. A little pricey, but you do get unique and tasty food"

42,Maxies, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Place has a great ambience and awesome people. They were A bit slow at the bar with service and it wasn't busy.

43,Maxies, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoyed entrées (crabcake, oysters, cojun popcorn), corn bread and seafood as the main course. They offer a hot green tea from Rishi! A waiter did a great job introducing us to all the different beverages and later the menu itself. I think …"
44,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A few of us southerners have been in Milwaukee working and have looked as well as visited quite a few restaurants that were supposed to be southern cooking.

49,Maxies, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I've been visiting this establishment with my family for years. The service used to be great! But this time the staff sat us at the bar with menus and never took our order for 30 minutes. It was an embarrassing and humiliating date night.

59,Maxies, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Great happy hour specials on food, staff was pleasant, entrees were delicious."
60,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Milwaukee restaurant with a southern spin. Fried catfish was great. 3$ Abita beers make anybody happy!
61,Maxies, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, nice bar with a big selection. The mixed drink I got was delicious!  Food was expensive and quite spicy. They don't have ranch, only some sauce with Tabasco in it. I hear the fried chicken is amazing, but they ran out before they took our order. I will try it again sometime though"
62,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Atmosphere was inviting,  waiter (son of the chef) was amazing,  engaging,  fun & helpful when ordering."

65,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just had the red deer dinner with mashed potatoes and veggies. It was quite fantastic. The good home cooked meal I've been looking for. Key lime pie was to die for, as the pastries always are. I often come for oysters during happy hour since it's such a deal but tonight really showed me that Maxie's does it right."

68,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable with drinks and provided great recommendations for our food.

69,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Fantastic authentic Cajun fare. Highly recommended! Only wish they were open for lunch.
70,Maxies, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Every time I eat here the food seems to get better,  it is to die for , just keep in mind you will need a reservation as they are always hopping, they also have quite the selection of bourbon"
71,Maxies, 4 stars ,a year ago,Pleasant atmosphere.. Kind & respectful waiters.. Good service.. Good food and clean environment
72,Maxies, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Oyster special at happy hour was the reason I pulled off the highway. The jambalaya blew me away. Others as my table crowed about the pulled pork, the catfish, and the ribs. Get there early if you don’t want to wait, but definitely get there!"

74,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I ate so much it hurt. Maxie's has the best fried green tomatoes in town. This Black Shoe restaurant is only open for dinner, and when they are open, they're quite busy. Reasonably so, this tosa area double decker restaurant serves southern style cuisine that is sure to please."
75,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is ALWAYS tasty - service team is pleasant - and the corn bread is a must have when you go...nice this is that’s it’s free! 🎉
They have a small outdoor space so hard to get a table outside when it’s busy."

78,Maxies, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Maxie's Fish Fry was delicious, more than enough for dinner.  It was a busy Friday evening but a spot opened up at the bar before our table did. Bartenders were awesome and checked back often enough without hovering. Great staff."
79,Maxies, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Dinner consisted of amazing cornbread, tasty corn and arugula salad, and then just an average brisket and okay fries. The main course was really a disappointment."
80,Maxies, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"It was the first time me and my husband had been out to dinner in over a year. Not only did they redo the dining room to make it Covid safe, but they also managed to make it look part of the decor, very secluded but also inviting. Our …"

91,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The wait is long but the food makes up for everything! Nothing like Southern comfort food.
92,Maxies, 3 stars ,a year ago,I gave it 3-stars for a few reasons. First service seemed rushed and forced. I made it a point to ask if it was a busy night and our waiter said it was actually a slow period. So asking for items such as napkins for two people and a few …

122,Maxies, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The service was excellent. Cocktails were terrific! Salmon and beef dish was excellent! Fried chicken tasted good, but a little cold.

123,Maxies, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fresh oysters were phenomenal. They grate fresh horseradish for the cocktail sauce. Grilled oysters, not so much. Greasy, served with soft white bread.

134,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun place to stop by on a quick trip to Milwaukee. We were looking for a BBQ place, and Maxie's does that, but also is into Cajun cuisine. Our server was very friendly and attentive, and recommended the corn salad and the mac and cheese, …"

All our meals were awesome And the NOLA oysters were my fav appetizer."
143,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favorite Milwaukee restaurants.  Great happy hour and on Sundays kids meals are $2.  Pair that with $1 oysters from 4-6 and drink specials it makes it an affordable night out for great great food.  Never know what to order because everything is so great and the specials are great too.
144,Maxies, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Amazing southern style cuisine.  Usually very busy, reservations strongly recommended."
145,Maxies, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Once you can get a seat (they generally have a wait list), the service is good as is the food. I had the shrimp and grits, they were delicious and the wait time for getting the food after the order was placed was only like 5 minutes. I also had a mojito, it wasn't to my liking at all."
146,Maxies, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent BBQ and other foods at a high price point. I had a half rack of St Louis style ribs with the beans, collard greens and corn/arugula salad for sides (Review of these below). I will likely be back at some point but it won’t be rushed. …"

167,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A little pricier than your average Tosa restaurant but well worth it! The service is amazing and the food is consistently good! My boyfriend and I like to walk there and have a few too many Kentucky Bourbon barrel ales. The corn bread they serve before your meal really helps soak everything in. 😉😅
168,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If your reading reviews of this place just go.   It's a bit pricey but worth it.  Fresh oysters, a huge whiskey selection, the cornbread is superb.   That's about as far into the menu as I got.  Though the bbq smells outstanding.   Im going back in a week to try some."
169,Maxies, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I would have to say my food was amazing, I ordered the four piece chicken combo that came with mashed potatoes and turkey fried greens. The chicken was nice and succulent but a little fresh from my taste, the fried turkey greens were beyond …"

173,Maxies, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is amazing! My only 2 dislikes are that I wish the prices were a bit lower (even of only by $2 or something) & that when they bring you the complementary cornbread that it was warm without having to ask for it. Past those points, you won't be disappointed with Maxie's"
174,Maxies, 3 stars ,a year ago,Greens are to die for... pulled pork another favorite. Stay away from the rice and beans they are missing something... ordered carry out and my fries were super cold and looked old. Cornbread is AMAZING but they can keep the side of orange …

178,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Why did I wait so long to come here?? My new favorite restaurant for a date or special occasion. I get the beef brisket and mac&cheese every time because it's INCREDIBLE and the leftovers give me two more dinners at home. Don't even bother with the other bbq places in town. Maxie's is it!!!
179,Maxies, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It was good and I'd go back to try a different dish. I got the BBQ tofu which was just a seasoned block of tofu (I thought it would be something else and should have asked) but it was still flavorful. I loved the veggies and mashed potatoes that came with it and the lemonade was good.
180,Maxies, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Very Nice atmosphere. The food was just OK for me. I ordered the Catfish Po-Boy and I've had better. The Collards were pretty good and the Grits were just OK also. I guess my expectations were a little high and I felt slightly disappointed. …

193,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Unique dishes and old favorites make up their menu.  Their chicken Tuesday special is phenomenal in flavor and price...enough to share (but tasty enough not to.)  Daily soup selection is excellent and if you are into oysters, they have a fine selection.  Unique decor and a great staff round out the experience perfectly."
194,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had my first visit to Maxie's tonight and it was amazing. The food was exceptional and the cocktails and beer selection were very well made.

206,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent Southern food, great wait staff. Prices are average & they have daily specials. I would recommend making reservations as it was middle of the week & they were packed. Parking is across the street from the restaurant. Helps to know that."

210,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I am so glad I came across this restaurant. It is seriously so much more than just your average, run of the mill restaurants, which are so similar when it comes to their options and choices for the food dishes offered on their menu. And that just becomes very boring!! But Maxie's was uniquely delicious!! 😋"

214,Maxies, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious food. Exactly what it promised to be. Great service! The server took my allergies into consideration and suggested adjustments and separated items to accommodate me.  The brisket was tender and perfect. The cocktails were on point.

261,Maxies, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best place to get a great variety of southern brewery beers. Abita is my favorite brewery and they always have the brews outside of the basics. The food is amazing as always and the service is top notch.  If you plan on coming on a weekend …

263,Maxies, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the fried chicken my first visit, and it was delicious. Had the jambalaya the second time I came and I was not impressed.

264,Maxies, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Love this place.  Food is always fantastic, and the drink menu is always on point.

270,Maxies, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great happy hour, best mojito in town. Love the unique menu options. One of our favorite places to get a quick drink & appetizer or stay for dinner.  There's a bar area on both levels so waiting for your table during peak times goes quick thanks to the atmosphere."

284,Maxies, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Waitstaff was great. Bartenders were great. Highlights: Maxie's margarita, Tasso gravy (Odd, but very tasty. Cumin, in gravy?), grits (spectacular!). My only complaint is that the sweetness level on the cornbread, which is served cold and …"
285,Maxies, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Iconic drive in. Daily changing custard flavors, make sure to pick up the schedule at the 1st of the month. We always get the burgers, with fried onions. They've retained the 'sameness' for the 30 years we've been going. Inside seating is somewhat limited, but there's seating outside as well. Always a favorite."

288,Maxies, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Fish fry was good!  Crab and corn chowder was excellent.  It was very busy and the fish was 86'ed by 8pm.  Meaning sold out.  We also are the mussels, which were very good.  A little pricey, but worth it."

Overall, the food is great the atmosphere is cool come by and check out Maxie's!!!"
310,Maxies, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Appetizer -  Cajun popcorn with remoulade - delicious.  Gumbo - amazing.  Hubby had pecan-crusted trout and cleaned his plate.  I had shrimp and grits - incredibly tasty sauce.  We went early and had great service.

314,Maxies, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The service at Maxi's is top notch! Our server, who usually bartends was so knowledgeable about the food and spirits menu, I was amazed.  I would give Maxi's 5 stars, but the food was just good, not great."
315,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Everything we ordered was excellent. The food was prepared just as it is in the south and cajun country. The service was great and the restaurant was immaculate. I'm excited to go back.
316,Maxies, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Four of us decided to try Maxie's while we were in town for business. We each had something different (jambalaya, shrimp and grits, trout, and chicken) and each loved what we had. Huge portions, so you won't go away hungry. The motif upstairs was also fun and interesting."
317,Maxies, 1 star ,2 years ago,Most expensive nasty meal I've ever had.  $45 for one catfish fillet and 2 sides. Lacked seasonings. Don't know how they stay open. Will never go again.

324,Maxies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always a nice place for dinner.  Not many o other places where you can get raw oysters and peel and eat shrimp.  We almost always leave with extra food since the appetizers and corn bread are a must.  Also, great happy hour if you can get there before 6."
325,Maxies, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Usually have great service, this visit we sat at the bar for drinks and appetizers. Service was fair. Ordered ousters and had to ask for them when our other food came out. Bartender was preoccupied by talking to friends at the bar."
326,Maxies, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Service was great, $23 for fries and dried out brisket covered in a basic bbq sauce will not make me return.  Almost like beef jerky- not impressed.   The $8 macaroni and cheese was flavorful."
327,Maxies, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"You can not keep grits in a steam table. They were so dried out, and the popcorn shrimp they served on top? You can buy a bag of frozen ( $7.99 ) at Pick & Save and get 4× the amount of shrimp. I haven't been there in a while. And it will be a while before I return. Good luck."
328,Maxies, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, food and drinks, this place has it all."

The service is always excellent, I have never been disappointed in Maxie's. Worth every dollar."

382,Maxies, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Over priced, over salted and overrated. For people that don't know ""down south cooking"" this place may be okay.... But comparing this place to anywhere in New Orleans is a crime. Unless you maybe wanna compare it to the Arby's on Canal Street."
