0,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great place to people watch, excellent food and service. 10/10 would recommend"
1,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Lovely service from Israelian girl. Some other people could be a bit more attentive. Food is good, beer is tasty, relatively wide choice. Try the Brand Weizen. Be sure to check the bill"
2,Caf√© Flinck, 1 star ,4 months ago,Will never come here again. Participating as the enforcement police for a QR code.  Many other places to support that respect personal privacy.
3,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,2 months ago,Super nice but the price was insane for a pint of chouffe (10eur bruh).
4,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food serving but xtremely overpriced. Not sure, if this place would be my first choice."
5,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great selection of beers. Friendly staff great tasting food wanted to stay longer
6,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great vibes for a beer on the patio! Delicious Dutch snacks!
7,Caf√© Flinck, 1 star ,a year ago,Very bad service. You need to keep ordering drinks to get tap water which is “free”. We had 10 drinks at this point btw. The waiter was super rude when trying to pay at the end. Please avoid at any cost. There are better places in the same lane. Wish could give 0 stars.
8,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good steak and very nice place to have a coffee or a G&T
9,Caf√© Flinck, 1 star ,7 months ago,Came by and threw trash in a restaurant we were sitting at. Very unprofessional and will never visit this place.
10,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Here I eat the best ""pork neck"" ever. Ribs are also a feast."
11,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Genuinely terrible! Ordered 1st and 2nd courses. Well over an hour later all our food arrived together with no apology (restaurant seemed averagely busy). Medium rare rib eye was thin and beyond well done. You get the picture - go elsewhere! Probably okay for just a beer.
12,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place with barbecue style meats. Friendly service and a nice atmosphere, which includes jungle style toilets (how weird). The selection of beers is not that great, but not bad either. In short: worth a visit."
13,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Fancy burger spot, burgers were good but very overpriced for what you get.

Stay away from the Portalbello mushroom burger, it was just a huge slimy chunk …"
14,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Don't arrive too late or some items of the menu will be already gone ;) Very tasty food and nice terrace
15,Caf√© Flinck, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Good bar for a quick beer and to chill on the terrace. Prices average and decent quality food. No frills but overall good. Please note that if you are there around 6pm you'll have quite some noise from the people dismantling the nearby Albert Cuypstraat Market.
16,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friday: the place full but not packed. No music out side but good atmosphere. People sitting and standing everywhere. Not a formal vibe. Very nice for a drink and a burger at night.
17,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy place. In the middle of the Pijp. A very nice area with lots of Restaurants and Bars. Close the the Albert Cuyp market. The service was very good. The staff is friendly and fast. Less stars as I was expecting a better quality of the food for that price. I'd recommend to go there for some drinks and move on to another place.
18,Caf√© Flinck, 1 star ,3 years ago,We waited more then an hour for the food. We asked 5 times and they always said its almost done. They also did not ask for something else to drink. Nothing. So we decided to go. If they would have said no please now ut will comein some …
19,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"After an hour wait we finally got our nachos, burnt, although the burnt nachos came with an apology from the chef once served."
20,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, comfortable place to sit and enjoy a meal and a few drinks. Great ambiance and we enjoyed the music. Highly recommend anything from their grill."
21,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We came to this café by chance after leaving the Albert Cuyp Market looking for somewhere quiet to sit.We sat outside where there was plenty of seating with canapys above.I had a latte and my husband opted for a fresh mint tea .The food …
22,Caf√© Flinck, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food but they refused to serve us glasses of tap water, even though we ordered 4 mains and one beer..."
23,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"The food is pretty good here, and they have a good selection of beers as well.
It's a nice place to come with a couple of friends and have a decent bite.
The burgers and the kip are very good."
24,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good vibes for beer and steak. Awesome food :)
25,Caf√© Flinck, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice location, but other than that nothing much special. Tosti was cold and plain. No choice for wholegrain for instance. Not a problem but then it's a bit too expensive."
26,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great food of a small card. Fresh, tasty, good beer and - no tourists.
A place where people from the local area have their after work beer.
Amsterdam as it lives."
27,Caf√© Flinck, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent location, average food. Ordered water and got served open bottles water which we were charged 2.5 euro for which wasn’t good. Would not return"
28,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,a year ago,Mixed platter was epic! Rare to go to a bar in Amsterdam and walk out happy with the food.
29,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice and cozzy place for snacks and drinks around the  pijp, nice staff as well! Highly recommended"
30,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Super rude and passive aggressive waiters- for some reason the terrace is closed on a Friday evening at 10pm, but only as long as people don't sit-it's fine to stand around, whatever that is about."
31,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We waited a little too much for our lunch, but the food was good and rustic, and the lovely waiter adviced me I was ordering too much food.
Lovely lunch at the Albertcuyp Market."
32,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Ribs
33,Caf√© Flinck, 1 star ,3 years ago,The staff is very unfriendly; they speak in an extremely rude way. You can stay at any other bar around the area and get better service.
34,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Drink orders were taken quickly, but after 20 minutes she hadn't come back to take our food orders. Very poor service."
35,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Exceptional food & warm, laid back atmosphere. Pork medallions & buttery sole with parsley mashed potatoes were delicious!"
36,Caf√© Flinck, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very bad service. Waited 45 min for our lunch, asked if they had forgotten, waited another 10 min. I then went inside to ask again, then heard that they forgot us... thing can happen but then at least let us know. Sad"
37,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cold beer and 5 star service!
38,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"good food, unfortunately we waited 40min for the food to arrive cold except the french fries."
39,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very tasty grilled food, especially recommend the asian style spareribs."
40,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to have a break from walking on the Albert Cuyp or when visiting de Pijp, have a small bite to eat or enjoy watching people go by with a drink in this busy but nice neighborhood."
41,Caf√© Flinck, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Just popped in for a quick drink. Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff.
42,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great hotel very clean and comfortable.  Friendly staff.  Close to airport 24hr free shuttle to and from airport.
43,Caf√© Flinck, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfriendly and slow service.
Food is acceptable but way too expensive."

45,Caf√© Flinck, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food and good service. The fries are great. Nice atmosphere.
