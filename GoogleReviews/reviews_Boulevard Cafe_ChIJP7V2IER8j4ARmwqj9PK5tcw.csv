8,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,a week ago,(Updated Review 2021) Been coming here for 10 years and getting take out throughout the pandemic.  Food quality as of today isn't as great as it used to be. I'm assuming due to inflation increasing food costs.  I always get the lamb burger. ‚Ä¶
9,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Indoor brunch 3/27/2021. Boulevard Cafe is a solid option for brunch. I had the St. Patty's eggs benedict $15 and a Bloody Mary $9. There's something special about breaking the egg and it flows down to the corned beef hash and the muffin on ‚Ä¶

14,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Tonight (1/17/22  7pm)we ordered the NY steak plate and the Carbonara with Prawns. Both were great dishes but I have to say the Carbonara with prawns will keep us coming back. Hats off to the chef for this amazing dish tonight! üëè

17,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Excellent service, very prompt at every level (hosting, servers, bussers), good food, and very good value because the quality is good and portions are on the large size. What is notable is how consistent their food preparation is, as there ‚Ä¶"

20,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Food is great.  But needs to be monitored better so when you receive your food it's piping hot. That part was disappointing.üôÅSuggest they invest in hot lamps or hire servers.
21,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We were very pleasantly surprised. We were driving by, saw it was open, and decided to stop in. Really nice staff. Service was on point. Clean and looks more upscale than I expected.  Comfortable seating.  A menu with options for everyone. ‚Ä¶"
22,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,10 months ago,The Pesto Rigatoni pasta is delicious and the Petrale Sole dish is fresh even in to-go form. Definitely worth the cost per food quality value.

27,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Had a great experience dining in. Wait time was around 20 minutes on a busy Sunday morning. Huevos rancheros with crispy tortillas hit the spot for me. Coffee was great and customer service was good.
28,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great old school feel with a huge selection. Ordered the daily special, which was the carnitas scramble. Tender and moist pork with just the right amount  of salsa verde. Also got the Swedish crepes. Lindoberries on top sealed this as an amazing dish!"
29,Boulevard Cafe, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,Food and price are both bad. Service good. Asked for a little gravy for my chicken waffles. I was charged almost 5 bucks. Unreal.

31,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"It's modern American comfort food with a few bonus Greek/Mediterranean touches (Avgolemono soup, lamb burger, Souvlaki!) It's a local Daly City goto spot to take family or meet friends for drinks in the bar. Brunch is busy on the weekends so patience is highly suggested."

Sole was slightly over. Excellent vegetables.
Wait staff was very attentive!"
33,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,3 months ago,I love their breakfasts but can never go since they open at 9am. 7am for breakfast would  be better. Atmosphere and service is nice. A little pricy though.
34,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A great mid century American diner architecture from the outside. But don‚Äôt get fulled, everything inside was gutted. The food is overall above average, and you can enjoy some great views of Daly City!

42,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Normal American faire. Waiter was nice but seemed new and couldn‚Äôt seem to get our orders straight. Food was decent but nothing particularly special.
43,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want to eat inside the bar on a Friday, the 5-6 PM hour is crowded, noisy and 3 bartenders + help isn't enough to keep up with demand.  Don't get me wrong, they are polite and accommodating but they need more help during that time ‚Ä¶"
44,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Food is excellent, but takeout is really slow. My food sat on the counter getting cold for 20 minutes while they made my drinks. They need to figure out a better system."

59,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,My friends want to meet for dinner and this was the place they selected. The parking lot is kind of small so there's not a ton of parking there. I actually rode BART over after work and was getting a ride home.  My friend actually had to ‚Ä¶

64,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Only ok.  The hash is always burned.  The food is just ok.  Horrible parking!  The cleaners did not clear off my used lemon wedges or straw paper.  I only go when someone else drives & forces me to go.  I went back today & enjoyed a very nice Greek pita chicken sandwich & nice crispy fries.  The staff are always very nice.
65,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Food is excellent and tasty, with good-sized servings. I have had the Moose for breakfast.For lunch my spouse and I had the Athenian Melt burger, which made us moan out load: lamb/beef patty, grilled onions, feta cheese, cumin-lime aioli, on grilled sourdough.The menu is diverse.

67,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Had a new employee there who was very apologetic for the wait, which really wasn't an issue since it only took about 5 minutes. There's good social distancing, the food was fantastic! Will definitely be going again, hopefully and then your future"
68,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Food was good and the service was relatively quick. The place had a pleasant vintage feeling to me and the familiar menu of American classics satisfied my desire for a hot sandwich and some fries.
69,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I would give 5 star for an amazing breakfast, even though our dessert have been brought late, because it accidentally had been went to another customers. But in a few days I found out that our waitress charged for $5 more than it suppose to be. Maybe she thought that I tipped less, but I think it‚Äôs optional"
70,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Breakfast was great. The eggs, hash browns, and sausages were all done exactly right. Beats most so called breakfast diners in my opinion. Only minor drawback is they're busy so food can take a while but definitely worth the wait!"

76,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Service is always great, food is always good, and as long as you're not at peak hours the wait isn't too bad. Watch out for the weekend brunch crowd though!"

78,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,3 months ago,Good. Overpriced. About 3-5 dollars pricier than other restaurants of the kind and not as good or generous.
79,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great remodeling done !!! The lounge is great if you can get in. Food is consistently good but always order extra gravy with biscuits and gravy.
80,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Think 60s art deco, a Jetson vibe mixed with a little bit of the Pulp Fiction intro.  The place is kept in pretty good condition and covid precautions were followed, down to ""packet"" style condiments.  Portions were decent and bordering ‚Ä¶"

87,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,a month ago,I only go here once in awhile because it's close. But it's over priced for Mediocre food.
88,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Food was surprisingly very very good.. Price was reasonable and portions were large. The only negative is that parking sucks. It's difficult for smaller cars. If you have a large car or SUV,  good luck."

100,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Places like the Boulevard Cafe fall into a very specific ""modern diner with throwback vibes"" niche. Breakfast items, check. Sandwiches and burgers, check. All-American staples, check. In all these, they excel. Staff are friendly and service is super efficient."
101,Boulevard Cafe, 1 star ,10 months ago,The waiter failed to gather our order correctly had to correct her multiple times. She had an attitude towards multiple guests while she was serving. The food came out cold and they charged me double with something I ordered originally.

Coconut shrimp was very tasty. Coffee shake was satisfying."
105,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Been there many times throughout the years, when my dad is visiting. For dinner only.  Good to great service, depending on the crowd. Love the milkshakes. Pastas are okay, but love the chicken pasta with angle hair pasta. Mom's meatloaf ‚Ä¶"

264,Boulevard Cafe, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"So I arrive with my family to meet some friends, the place is fairly empty but it's Sunday night. My friends have already arrived and put our name in, upon our arrival I ask the host how long it will be and then they realize they have a ‚Ä¶"

267,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Used to go here all the time. Sat and Sun a.m. can be Very busy. But if you like very basic home style cooking its pretty good. I think Jacks in SSF and San Mateo are owed by the same family...they are better.
268,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a good place to meet and talk, and just kick back the atmosphere is busy and the service was great as well as the food. The menu and the price of the food is very good. Eat, drink and be merry, life is short so make it good."
269,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Nice and clean with friendly fast service.
270,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We stopped here for lunch en route from San Fran to Monterey. Service was friendly, wine was nice, burgers good, Blvd Pasta great, chicken souvlaki and oregano fries yummy if garlicky (not for a date!). Only negative is men's restrooms were a bit of a mess - ladies were fine. We would come back."
271,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Always stop here to eat when visiting family. Everything I have had is great. Anything from the breakfast or lunch menu you can't go wrong. I was born and grew up in Daly City and eating there is like coming home.

274,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good food, pleasant servers."
275,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Local tip: if you're over 21 try sitting in the lounge. Theres usually no wait, and you get the same great menu, minus the kids. Family friendly, but expect to wait for a table. Parking lot is small, so expect it to be full. Parking across the street is easy to get to."
276,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"She had a Blvd Burger which looked very boring to me. Thousand Island, Sauteed Onions and American Cheese with a meat patty smaller in diameter than the bun. She said that it was ""alright"". ‚Ä¶"
277,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice hostess. She got a single table for me quickly. The food was good, but a little cold and was precooked, except for the eggs, which were cooked perfectly."
278,Boulevard Cafe, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Service is terrible. Food, drinks and change from the check is brought to the wrong table numerous times. The food is very bland. Not much flavor. We had eggs, pancakes and eggs Benedict all of it was meh. No refill on the water or coffee and we had to get up and find our own sugar since it was impossible to get anyone's attention."
279,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food here is average at best.
The Carnitas and Eggs in the weekends is one of their better options.
What is concerning though is the lack of awareness by them and their valet ‚Ä¶"
280,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great place for fresh food at a reasonable price.
281,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good for brunch. Large portions in exchange for slightly lower food quality (a step up from IHOP). Fully staffed for the size, means your coffee is always full."
282,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cool mid-century modern aesthetic. Wide ranging menu and decent prices. Nailed the Eggs Benedict. Go during the week before you attempt a weekend breakfast here, its a popular spot."
283,Boulevard Cafe, 1 star ,4 years ago,This restaurant is overrated and overpriced for such low quality food and a sub-par dining experience. I've been to this place many times simply because we live nearby but cannot understand how it gets so busy and crowded here. They are so ‚Ä¶
284,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food and service was excellent. Would have been 5 stars if it weren't so difficult to find parking, but after 5pm they have valet parking."

286,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is an absolute favorite for us - we've been known to travel from as far as Tahoe to get here for a mac 'n' cheese dinner.  Love the retro feel and the valet parking, and we've always gotten great service from the waitstaff."
287,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best hamburgers I've had in awhile.  Plenty of seating spots and the wait staff was paying attention to our drink levels.  It was a really enjoyable experience

294,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great spot for hearty and large portions, especially if you don‚Äôt have a specific type of food in mind. Lots of options. Price is a bit high these days, but portion size makes up for it."

299,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I didn't like the Meat loaf.  The tutore Mare spaghetti was too sour and spicy.  Bread was good. good portion. Nice & Clean decor.
300,Boulevard Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fast service! Delicious breakfast on a Saturday. Complimentary Valet Parking made the experience effortless. Will definitely eat there again.

303,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Normally their food is competent at best, but today their fried chicken and waffle is awful. The chicken is really dry, like it's fresh from the microwave and the waffle is a little charred. ‚Ä¶"
304,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,10 months ago,They really need to work on the cream brulee..the top was soft?and the middle was cold..definitely needs improvement
305,Boulevard Cafe, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"I usually love this place, I would come here for breakfast and loooove their hash browns, but I had put my name down for 2 and the girl said sure and told me it would be 15-20 minutes. We waited and waited and groups or 2 and 3 were seated ‚Ä¶"

316,Boulevard Cafe, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Meh, nothing too fancy at this d√Æner. It's overpriced if you ask me, and the servers are not attentive at all. The portion size is probably the best thing.. I would only go here again if I'm starving and craving diner food."

323,Boulevard Cafe, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The eggs Benedict was medicore.  They were understaffed. Our party didn't get much refills on coffee.  Orders never came.  It's hard to give this place a good recommendation.
324,Boulevard Cafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food. Service is sometimes good, but sometimes I feel forgotten by the servers.  It's a regular go-to place for my family.  I love the Reuben sandwich."
