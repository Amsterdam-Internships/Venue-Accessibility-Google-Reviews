4,Restaurant Bord'Eau, 5 stars ,10 months ago,We got their Christmas box which was a three course dinner. It was a fun experience to assemble the food and great instruction videos.

5,Restaurant Bord'Eau, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Visited here for the second time with my wife and brother. We booked the private dining room for the experience. Staff were very friendly and polite. We tried the 6 course tasting menu. It was based on the earth & sea. The quality and …

10,Restaurant Bord'Eau, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of the best star restaurants in Amsterdam. It took us months to get a table. But it was worth the wait. Service is fantastic. Food full of well balanced flavours without being overwhelming. Presentation is beautiful and the view of the canal gives a very cozy feeling. Prices are normal for this type of restaurants.

17,Restaurant Bord'Eau, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Been here 3 times before. Looking at the total bill and what it was when I visited the first time about 4 years ago, it has not excited me.
