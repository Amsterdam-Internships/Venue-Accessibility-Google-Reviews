0,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good burritos but may be a little too salty (burritos chicken). I still do not know what it is the difference between a mexican and a californian burrito. Nice place & nice staff. For the zombies, there is some wifi."
1,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best burritos in Amsterdam. Everything is very fresh. It is great how they put the burrito in a grill press before they serve it to you. Hot and tasty. But... But... If you are from the states and are used to a Moe's or Chipotle, you'll be …"
2,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Tastes good, but this shop must change their name. THEY DOES NOT HAVE California burrito (which has fries in it). If you want some decent burritos, this place will be good for you. If you looking for Californina burrito, you cannot find that one here."
3,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Compared to the other restaurants in the area, the prices here are pretty good. I give it three stars though because the service was subpar and the burrito itself was rather average. I wish it was something more to write home about but I was left wanting."
4,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,3 years ago,From a Mexican born national who has lived in California.   This is NOT a good representation of SoCal Mexican food.  Its more like a cheap knock off to taco bell
5,California Burrito Company, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Have been coming here on and off for the last 5 years or so, and I really think they've gone downhill over the last year. I'm not sure what has changed, but the quality of the food and the service has declined quite a lot. Used to be my …"
6,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"When hungry in the city... This is one of the best options to recharge your self ;)
I like the grilled chicken and salad the most...
Especially when there is El Jefe :D"
7,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty delicious burritos! They can make your burrito very spicy. Their snack size burrito is enough for one person. We ended up sharing it.
I would definitely come back in the future. Service was quick and friendly.
Outlets are located at each table so that you can charge your phone while you eat."
8,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really great burritos, and quesedillas.
Very good prices."
9,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food here is just okay. I ordered a veggie burrito, which was fine. Not all the ingredients tasted fresh and it had a lot of lettuce. I asked for medium spice, but the whole thing tasted very bland. Also tacos are hard shell here. Go to salsa shop for fast spicy burritos with fresh ingredients."
10,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The service is brusque but efficient, the burritos lack depth of flavor but are filling and well-constructed. Really hit the spot."
11,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"If you're looking for an authentic California experience, this isn't it. At least the nachos leave something to be desired. I cannot speak for the burritos which did look tasty. You can't get grilled chicken or steak on the nachos. They …"
12,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This just completely satisfies my American craving for texmex and burritos.  It's not a perfect place, but it really is very tasty, the staff are friendly.  Veggie snack burrito with guacamole, around 5 euros, every time.  Medium spicy and it's damn spicy!  I have been here 20 times and don't plan to stop any time soon."
13,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I wasn't a fan of Burritos until a while ago, but California Burrito's ones are out of these world! I come from a Latin country, so I really missed the taste of every ingredient used in them. …"
14,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Thank you for your service, Salsa Shop. I've found something much better. Thank you based pinto beans, thank you based OGCB, and thank you based tetanus shot (tetanus shot is unrelated, I didn't find any rusty sharp metal in this …"
15,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The burrito is ok, but nothing more. The burrito filling was too moist. It's expensive, but then again, it's in the heart of Amsterdam, everything is overpriced. The staff was friendly, and right across the street is one of the best coffee shops in town."
16,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice burritos close to center. I recommend their chilli con carne.
17,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I initially thought it was a bit pricey but the portion sizes are huge, so actually very good value for money.  Tried the quesadilla and nachos and they were loaded with lots of toppings and flavours! YUM!"
18,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Generously portioned burritos with a nice selection of ingredients. Spicy but not really spicy for the hardcore. Staff are straight forward and to the point but attentive.
19,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I've done some research before to find the best burrito in Amsterdam, and found this cozy spot on the internet because it had some very good reviews... This burrito was awesome and i can recommend it to other people, very fresh products, …"
20,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I ate the original beef burrito and it was amazing. After 2 days i came back and ate the grilled chicken one, also really good! I would definitely recommend that place, friendly environment, good wifi and nice staff."
21,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It is always a good option if you want something quick and tasty (and if you like burritos, of course). Now they have this small burrito, which is great to get going visiting our beautiful Amsterdam."
22,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Go here often to grab lunch
Staff are friendly, but the burritos are quite expensive for what they are​ but that is unfortunately standard Amsterdam prices for Mexican food. …"
23,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"A fun hole in the wall burrito place. Was it California? Meh, close. The food tasted well and was close to the real thing. The burritos had the classic ingredients like rice and beans and toppings of guac, salsa and cheese. The chips were …"
24,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Got good burritos, got a veggie option customized. Not too much sitting space, but ok for smaller groups of people. Free Wi-Fi option available, and as I was an international traveler without a roaming data connection this one was a boon …"
25,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Well placed near the red zone has a good size and flavor. The problem is that when you order the prices goes up and up. So for 2 quesadillas we ended up paying 34 euros with 2 drinks.  We must say that they were delicious. But they fail to show it in the menu how much it's  going to cost you.
26,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty good burritos and quite tasty chips and salsa. It's a little pricey if you're used to US prices for burritos, but if you want a quick central place to eat, this is a good option"
27,California Burrito Company, 2 stars ,7 years ago,We've been twice now. Both times there was (and I feel old saying this) music playing loud enough to prevent conversations at tables. Customer service is lacking. The first time we went we got a quesadilla which was just OK. The second time …
28,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,4 years ago,You only get nachos if you eat there not if you get delivery ?! even though there are  nachos on the pictures!  After we gave them a call they yelled at us and told us the nachos are just decoration hung up! We called a second time as we …
29,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Cozy place, not for big groups. Food tastes very good. Not so much a fastfood joint, which is a good thing. Will surely recommend and visit again!"
30,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I asked for no pico in my quesadilla because I just wanted cheese - not only did I get pico IN the quesadilla but I also got it on the side. My quesadilla was also burnt and the cheese was not fully melted. But maybe that’s the way …
31,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Best burrito place in Amsterdam. One star off because not as well run as other places, but still good value/taste. The cheese they use is more of a cheddar blend, far better than the flakey white cheese other places use"
32,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Very good burritos. Decent portions and you can choose what you want inside. They have Quesadillas and nachos as well. Prices are not low but ok for Amsterdam city centre.
33,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great burrito place and friendly personal.  Several people told me it's the best in Amsterdam. Great guacamole. Be aware: spicy is really spicy!
34,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,a year ago,Menu and selection is quite confusing compared to similar build your own burrito places.  Food on the other hand was very very good.
35,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,6 years ago,I'm from Los Angeles and know my burritos.  This was like a taste of home!  Very good salsa.  Spicy! :-D  And the people were awesome!  So friendly and fun to talk to!
36,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I live in California, so it was funny never seeing this restaurant here but finding it in Amsterdam. If you have Mexican food in Europe, well I don't want to be traveling with you for starters.Go for the local cuisine! But also, be wary. Great options are few and very expensive."
37,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"1 review, and this review is a one star? Come on... this place is better then that! But Paul is right about the speed.. He should have been there in the beginning, it was even worse! Haha …"
38,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"There weren't a lot of Mexican style restaurants in Amsterdam, but this place did the trick. The food was made to order. I would compare it to a Moe's back in the U.S."
39,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Wow this is pretty bad... for starters the service is very really bad. Nothing Californian about that. Everything is a one syllable word question... this is all the guy said to me ""hey"" ""guacamole?"" ""spicy"" ""8.50"" and ""beef burrito?"". OK …"
40,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Jesus Christ. Best Burrito ever. Hot sauce is hot, staff is very nice, close to a headshop. A bit pricy, even for Amsterdam. 9/10"
41,California Burrito Company, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff played super loud rap music and acted unfriendly. Food was okey, asked for a mild sauce in my burrito but it was so hot i could barely eat half"
42,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I've eaten a lot of burritos in my life I can proudly say this was one of the best burritos I've ever eaten. Great munchies food 😉
43,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The quesadillas are incredible - in a city full of great food, it takes a lot to stand out, and these guys do just that. Great value, great taste."
44,California Burrito Company, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The location is great. The portions are big. The taste is average-bad and the service is horrendous. Looks like they're doing the customer a favour by rolling a burrito.
45,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here at around 1pm. Quick service. Only a small family were eating in. Received food within 5mins after ordering. Very good. Thank you!!+
46,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great burrito place. Wasn't expecting this quality in Amsterdam. It tends to get crowded, and the wait for the food was long. But it was worth it. Love the other sodas they have."
47,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice staff, great food and really filling. Burritos are stuffed full of food and taste great. Definitely recommend."
48,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"With a take-away order, you don't get the tortilla chips. Though, fresh and nice food!
Wenn man's mitnehmt bekommt man keine Tortilla's :("
49,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Boyfriend had a snack burrito and loved it! Fast, fresh, delicious, inexpensive"
50,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good burrito, decent price but got medium heat and it was very very hot."
51,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Small burrito shop not far away from the royal palace. A well balanced menu, differently spiced sauces and a friendly staff round up a tasty burrito."
52,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food however staff can be a little friendlier. I ordered a takeaway over the phone, when I went to collect it, the guy got my order wrong and insisted I ordered something I didn't."
53,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,5 years ago,food is delicious! but it takes them forever to take an order and prepare it... they really need to work on their workflow and customer friendliness...
54,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I don’t recommande this place.
If I could put minus starts I would.
Taste: -5 …"
55,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Really poor customer support. Ordered food via Uber Eats, received only part of the order. Called them several times to try to fix them. Their solution was to deal with Uber Eats. What kind of customer support is that?"
56,California Burrito Company, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The burrito was okay but the chicken was too dry and over salted. The black beans were too watery and overall the food lacked harmony.
57,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Steak burrito for the win. Good quality and worth the money. You can eat a lot and cheap compered to other places in Amsterdam center.
58,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious, big and fat burritos. If you’re into spicy, the hot sauce is thick and rich, loved it."
59,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"great burritos, too much rice tho. also i think some iceburg lettuce would make it a lil bit better."
60,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Door has been broken open... For 3 months now. It's freezing inside.
Food is alright.
Service is the worst it gets in Holland. Was luck the guy even looked at me."
61,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They charged my credit card twice with the same value! Food is okay but nothing special, low quality to price ratio"
62,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is good. The queue can be huge, especially at lunch time when a perfect foodora or Uber eats order comes in."
63,California Burrito Company, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Eatable but definitely not what I would consider an original burrito. They probably get most of their business from the coffeeshop around the corner.
64,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is delicious! Prices though are a little spicy, but for a one time meal or a few it is worth it!"
65,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food! But don't get experimental, just get a burrito and nachos."
66,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent burrito bar! Good vibes, good music and the food is sooo good, exactly what I like!"
67,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Seen better days. Food was missing zest of previous occasions. Stock was low, staff were friendly with some lack of enthusiasm. Worth checking out."
68,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,4 years ago,"very average and dry burrito, drinks were forgotten, the 'extra' guacemole was unfindable. Won't recommend!"
69,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food. Prices Are ok. Quote small but not a Problem for those on the go.
70,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very slow, the employees were discussing loudly with each other. A lot of people who arrived after, got food before us. Very unorganized."
71,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food,Self service,Quite cheap but good portion size."
72,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Love the food here!!! Free WiFi and great food after getting high across the street at Grey Area. Fresh and clean restaurant
73,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We've been before, they make a tastey and hefty borrito. A good price and friendly staff."
74,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,7 years ago,I stop by weekly at CBC! Delicious burritos and for sharing a quesadilla for lunch is perfect mmmm! Great place!
75,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great burritos for okay prices. I can definitely recommend this place.
76,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible experience , wait too long for the order , i dont know the staff inside has a bad day or they just hate their jobs , or they just see their manager evey day , but people please dont go there."
77,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food! Good place, nice staff, free amazing wifi."
78,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good burrito. As a foreigner living abroad this was a welcome piece of home!

81,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, wonderful and friendly service. Seating is a bit lacking, so plan accordingly."
82,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious burrito, really cheap prices, good selection of vegetarian options."
83,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,4 years ago,It's ok! Clearly a European take on tex-mex. Spicy food here is spicy for real. Not much seating
84,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Fine for NL burritos and you're craving a burrito. Stick to the burritos and you're pretty safe.
85,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good spot if you need a burrito fix.  Not as good as Chipotle (US), but it does the trick!"
86,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Burrito was good. Nothing spectacular, but a good burrito for an affordable price."
87,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good burritos, a bit salty tho. Great quesadilla. Try the chilly con carne burrito or the veggie quesadilla."
88,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,a year ago,Being from CA this place has pretty authentic burritos.
89,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Damn good burrito. Definitely a place to go if you need a break from European food

91,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty Burrito's. Good vegetarian option. For sure you get enough 😋
92,California Burrito Company, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good structure. Bland or spicy so not much flavour but all good for basic takeaway

99,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best California style burrito I've had in the Netherlands.
100,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The nachos were weird. No grilled steak nachos and no grilled chicken. If you're from California this is probably not what you have in mind.
101,California Burrito Company, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Thats how I like my burrito ! Great service, great food. Do it right"
102,California Burrito Company, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Perfect Burrito’s! The only thing is the music is always sooo loud inside :(
103,California Burrito Company, 1 star ,4 years ago,Employees wear gloves BUT touch their mobile phones between handling the food and don’t change gloves!!!  Gross!  Won’t eat here again.
