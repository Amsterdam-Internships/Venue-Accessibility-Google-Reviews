0,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,a month ago,I completely recommend this place if you are waiting to go to the museum or are hungry after. The eggs Benedict with bacon was extremely delicious. The food came quickly and the staff were great. There is also a very cute and friendly cat ‚Ä¶
1,Pompa Tapas Bar, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Super friendly service all throughout and very cozy, relaxed environment. The food was just average though. The empanadas with feta and spinach were the winners actually, and the patatas bravas were also ok, but the bruschettas and the gambas a la plancha were a bit underwhelming."
2,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"The staff greeted me politely and recognised me for visiting again!
The biggest reason to visit the same restaurant again was the delicious pasta!!
The service is amazing. ‚Ä¶"
3,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Loved this place. The menu was excellent, I struggled to choose just one thing! Good value for money, good portion sizes and a menu to suit all. has a nice chilled atmosphere"
4,Pompa Tapas Bar, 2 stars ,a month ago,The hummus was nice but the Tortellacci Neri Salmon was way over cooked and tasteless. After complaining about it they said that this is how it is supposed to be. Don't order it
5,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Good food and friendly staffs. Their tuna carpaccio Panini was quite good. It was perfect with a glass of white wine.
6,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,Fantastic Italian restaurant. Extremely friendly and accommodating staff. Food was authentic and tasteful. Keep an eye out for the specials. Some gems on there!
7,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Lovely spot for dinner. As others have said, a really cosy, mellow atmosphere - including sleeping cats by your side quite possibly! - super friendly staff and Mediterranean food that hits the spot.... ‚Ä¶"
8,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I like their food, coffee and playlist!

I love their positive vibes ‚ù§Ô∏è"
9,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,The Ravioli and the salmon were delicious. Nice athmosphere in the restaurant- with an adorable cat on top!
10,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"I went there for a coffee and a chocolate cake, overall it was a good experience with polite staff."
11,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Coffee, hot chocolate and pasta were so-so, but my steak was above expectations. Properly cooked fine meat. Highly recommend! Large portions (I also got some bread, French fries and vegetables). Quite cheap for Amsterdam. Good location next to the museums square."
12,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for dinner. Not too far a walk from city center. They have lots of great pasta options; I had the creamy penne con pollo. They also have two cats that just walk around, they don't bother with the tables but they will sit on the bench if there's an empty space. Good atmosphere and great service."
13,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I ordered some pasta (Ravioli Truffati), but nothing special. The pasta has no flavor at all and the tomato sauce was very strong, also I found some rest of other pasta in my meal. It looked like no enthusiastic preparation. The place is small. I do not recommend this place."
14,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Had really good paninis, I got the salmon fillet and my wife had the goat cheese & tomato soup.  Our friends both got the lasagna and said it was pretty good."
15,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service:
Semi-attentive. As a relaxed area, we find it customary to reach out to our waiters/waitresses more in Europe. ‚Ä¶"
16,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wonderful place! We ordered Spaghetti with tomato sauce and beef steak with grilled vegetables & fries. Both dishes were amazing! Everything was fresh and delicious. The service was great and very fast (even though the place was full!)
17,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there on a Saturday evening, it was super windy ourside. We got our table in a second. The service and the taste of the food are something to mention, it feels so rewarding to find combination of both. ‚Ä¶"
18,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,4 months ago,I personally had a bad main dish (pasta gambaretti) but the appetizer and my dad's food were amazing so they deserve 4 stars
19,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had tomato soup with basil, loved it! Cozy and comfortable, staff are all wonderful, and the two cutest cats reside here! Would come again my next visit ‚ù§Ô∏è"
20,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, great service and great staff. We had a mixed of tapas, and dishes for the children. I'll be back here."
21,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect pasta‚Äôs, ambiance and staff. Need a place for some delicious Italian food? Brasserie Pompa is the place to go in Amsterdam :)"
22,Pompa Tapas Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Somewhat mediocre tapas. Especially disappointing that a range of different dishes come with the same sauce. I've lived in Spain so I feel I'm qualified to judge.
23,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good. The food was really quite alright. The bitterballen were tasty, the lasagna Bolognese could have been a bit more ""meaty"" (although this way is much more healthy)."
24,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Walked into this wonderful restaurant. Was packed with people, with good reason. Mushroom Ravioli and lasagna was amazing. Great ambience, service and food.. Would recommend to anyone."
25,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Stopped here after the Van Gogh museum and ended up really enjoying it. It's more spacious than you first thing and they have a really good selection of tapas to pick from. I ended up just getting the patatas bravas since I wasn't super ‚Ä¶
26,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Worst service ever. I had to wait more than 30 min to get served. I had to stand in front of the door to force them to take our order.
Then 30min for basket of fries and 2 panini.
Won't come back again."
27,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, friendly staff and awesome presentation. Food was freshly prepared and nicely made. Complimentary bread with butter"
28,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"British tourist, enjoyed the food, beer and atmosphere, would recommend even just to have a drink outside and watch the world go by. Natural all the staff are very friendly and English speaking."
29,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing Italian dishes,  great environment and super friendly service"
30,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a nice option for those who want to have a nice brunch in Amsterdam. Five minutes walking from the amazing Museumplein, is a good start point if you wish to visit all the museums in the area or just have a cozy lunch with your friends. Very polite and friendly staff."
31,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great lunch spot close to the museums.  Friendly staff and good service.  I had a delicious pasta dish and friend loved her fish soup (more seafood including fish and mussels).  Food came with good portion of bread.  Definitely wouls eat here again.  If you are in the museum district worth going.
32,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Very good food and nice waiters. Portions a bit small but would otherwise 100% recommend.
33,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Relaxing atmosphere, the Plato was super yummi and great to share for 2 (if you are both not too hungry üòã)."
34,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,7 months ago,I hardly ever write opinions but this time I can't let go how rude the staff were. I'd never ever experienced something like that before. The server was full-on sarcastic (in a very negative way) for no reason. It made me cry after Ieft. Honestly the worst experience in a restaruant/cafe ever.
35,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Loved it. One of the best pesto pasta I had. And the service is awesome ;)
36,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice place for a quick lunch. Food 5/5  Price 5/5  Service 5/5 - Clean as well.

38,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice cozy spot with delicious pasta and a very helpful owner who solved small issue we had with the upmost patience. The ambiance sets everything together.
39,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious food. Really cute restaurant and decor. They have outdoor seating and a small balcony. The man and woman that served us were so kind

The cat is also super nice to pet"
41,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We ventured just a little off our busy street and had a lovely experience. Both the waitresses were friendly and helpful, one suggesting the best cheese to go with our other appetizer. She chose well and didn't pick the most expensive, just ‚Ä¶"

I really enjoy that little sauce served with the bread.
All plates that we took were very good. ‚Ä¶"
49,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food at a nice location. Had the Fish and chips here and was really nice. The chips were also good. Would also definitely recommend getting a tapas Platter. The place had a nice atmosphere and is on a nice location. It ain't too busy ‚Ä¶
50,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great restaurant, variety of tapas, pasta and main meals. All our breaks were really tasty and excellent value. Friendly fast service, lovely place, really nice stained glass windows lots of natural light"
51,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Not surprised to see that we weren't the only one treated with disrespect by not the owner but one of his staff. Burger and pasta I would say were below average and obviously the rude staff(tall bold guy) made our experience at this place a ‚Ä¶
52,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"First of all I want to say the food is really nice but BEWARE of the night waitress!!
Here my story: ‚Ä¶"
53,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great for history buffs.
54,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food - a bit of everything, Tapas, pasta, panini, soups, good choice for vegetarians also. Very friendly staff, I liked it a lot and would recommend it for every time of the day. If you are lucky you can spot the house cats who like to occupy the bench near the window."
55,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Quite possibly does the best club sandwich I‚Äôve ever tasted. Cosy European atmosphere with service to match.
56,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice food. We ordered a grilled chicken panini, salmon black pasta, fish and chips and tapas shrimps. They are all very delicious and worth the price. Will recommend. :)"
57,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, Nice price and Nice Staff! The dishes are really big and very well seasoned!! The place looks small, but it‚Äôs bigger than it seems! The staff was really kind and helpful! I‚Äôd come back."

59,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Came in for lunch and a group of 7 ahead of us decided to squeeze together at a table for 2. Wait staff allowed them to, ok fine. But then when we tried to sit at an open table, the staff moved another group of 2 to free up space for the ‚Ä¶"

62,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The food was great as the service.
63,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food and fast service as well. Food came piping hot and fresh. We both had pasta which were great but the man having fish and chips beside us did make us a  little jealous. Just beside the museum area easy to get to and can sit inside or out.
64,Pompa Tapas Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I think the restaurant could be better in one big way. The service and staff. They really need to lighten up and acknowledge customers when they walk in. It took me a couple minutes to get someone's attention, granted it was the busboy ‚Ä¶"
65,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Easy going, comfortable restaurant serving tasty tapas and pasta. Cheerful, friendly service; so good we went twice. Perfect after  wandering around the van Gogh museum nearby. The freshly cooked sardines were lovely."

67,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"I went here with my mother for her birthday and we had some of their tapas dishes and it was brilliant! It is relatively cheap, but wonderful non the less. They have a lot of dishes with fishes and shellfish, which were prepared perfectly, ‚Ä¶"
68,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,Lovely cappuccino with local milk!
69,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We went here because another restaurant had too long a wait. The staff was friendly and helpful even though we were there pretty late. The food was pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but decent food at a fair price."
70,Pompa Tapas Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The staff here was very nice, but the food was a bit of a let down for the prices. We ordered the calamari, chicken pasta, and the seafood pasta that has the mussels in it. My husband liked the chicken pasta fairly well, but the calamari ‚Ä¶"
71,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really quite lovely,  great relaxed atmosphere , had a glass of red wine lamb chops , some olives and spaghetti bolognese.

74,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The wait staff was friendly and the food was exactly what we were looking for on our first night in Amsterdam! We got the caprese salad, potatos bravas, my mom got fried calimari (I didn't eat it bc I don't like seafood but she loved it!). ‚Ä¶"
75,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quite the calm place, loved the spanish atmosphere. My cousin and I ordered some serrano ham, coffe, and hot chocolate and all of them were delicious. It's the perfect place if you want to get out of the cold and have some relaxing time. Just a small lovely place."
76,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service, huge portions."
77,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My wife and I were visiting the Van Gogh museum nearby and happened upon this restaurant.  I had the lasagna bolenase.  It was excellent.  The staff was nice and helpful.   Pricing was fair.   It was probably the best value meal of our trip.  I highly recommend Pompa.
78,Pompa Tapas Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty neat place and well located near museum. Good for a quick lunch. Pasta was ordinary. Fish an chips are quite nice. Reasonably priced for Amsterdam
79,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good food. We got the creamy penne pesto & lasagna bolognese. Both were good. We loved the kitties in the cafe - very fun!
80,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food was absolutely delicious and the waitress was very nice. I can‚Äôt say much more than that this is the best food I‚Äôve had on this holiday by miles. Waiting time was good as well. Ordered the chicken pasta.
81,Pompa Tapas Bar, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Less than average Benedict eggs and terrible coffee latte
82,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little place. Everything was good - the ravioli, pasta, olives, even the fish and chips. The restaurant is located stratergicly near the museums and parking garage, so very convenient for a quick lunch between museums or exhibition."

87,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place in the heart of Amsterdam city. I'd prefer a bit more prompt service but overall it's outstanding. The place is right across Museumplein and it makes a great plan to spend some time there after making yourself more intelligent ‚Ä¶
88,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"very good food, nice place to eat, good location, nice staff, not expensive (considering the location). just an all around very good restaurant."
89,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This restaurant never disappoints. Always good food & friendly staff. We live in the neighbourhood and it is one of our go to spots. Even the grilled cheese and tomatoe soup is delicious. Any of their pastas are great. The Scaloppine di Pollo is also highly recommended
90,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,I cann't believe the other reviews are genuine!! This is a pure trap for tourist. expensive. terrible service. We where a table of 7 guests. none found the food ok (beside the bread that was good). We ask for plain pasta and when we ‚Ä¶
91,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved the food we had here. The mushroom ravioli with truffle pesto was excellent, as was the spaghetti Bolognese. The bread was hot and fresh, and we loved Spanish olives. The dish that could have been better were the fish croquettes. ‚Ä¶"

93,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We always come here for lunch during a day out at the museums at Museumplein. The combination plates are perfect, so we get one of each and share, adding a few other tapas as we go. Definitely recommend!"
94,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very tasty pastas. Good vegetarian options. Per person meal can cost somewhere between 17-20 euros (pasta + drinks + bread). Nice cosy place and friendly service. Walking distance from the van Gogh museum.
95,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food was not good. Carbonara apparently had no eggs in it and tasted like pure garlic. The waiter was ruder than anyone I've ever met. Wouldn't come back, even for free. It seemed like he was doing us a favor, although we were paying. If you want to eat around Museumpleim, don't come to Pompa."
96,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I'm kinda upset at myself that I'm just now getting to writing this review after a year raving about it to everyone and anyone who tells me they're going to Amsterdam. It was after a very long flight when we finally landed and were trying to offset the jet lag one has for flying for countless hours.
97,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This restaurant saved my life. It was a cold and wet night, most of the restaurants were closed. I happened to jump into this restaurant. Although they were almost closed, the waitress gave me warm welcome. The food was also amazing. I ‚Ä¶"

99,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really excellent and fast service and tasty food served there.
100,Pompa Tapas Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,We turned up for breakfast on Sunday and were greeted with a scowl. The food that followed didn't improve on that first impression. Fortunately for them I am the only person on the planet who doesn't mind an overcooked ham cheese omelette - this is how they earned the one star from me.
101,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Came here because their Sangria was recommended on the internet and wasn't disappointed. So if you are looking for a tapas place with a great sangria, try this place out."
102,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A quaint little place near the Rijksmuseum. Great food, great service, but busy, busy, busy. We had to wait for 20min to be seated as we just walked in during lunch."

110,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great spot located near the Rijksmuseum. Good selection of items with decent prices. Best eggs benedict my wife and I have ever had. Do yourself a favor, and avoid the food vendors directly outside the museum. The 6 min walk to Pompa is well worth it."
111,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is cute and delicious.  I ordered the Penne Funghi.  It was very flavorful and a decent portion size. The waiter was very friendly and the place had good vibes overall.
112,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I didn't intend to eat there. I just was waiting for something. But after I found the food there was awesome. I really like it a lot. I would recommend this place.
113,Pompa Tapas Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I ordered a Creamy Penne with chicken and it was decent. It was however extremely overpriced as I have eaten pasta at different locations and also a Michelin Star pasta restaurant in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶
114,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The fish and chips and calamari were very well breaded! Came with Tangy sauce and ketchup. The chocolate souffle is lava cake. It was classically delicious! üç∞ üíï

126,Pompa Tapas Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was served quickly, but sadly the poached egg was over-done and vinegary. Otherwise a perfectly good little place to grab a drink and a bite to eat."
127,Pompa Tapas Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Superfast and pleasant service! Relative cheap meals, but very taste. We live closeby and when we don't feel like cooking, we go to pompa. Don't know why ratings are low...it deserves better."

129,Pompa Tapas Bar, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I ordered kebabs for starters and i got 3 tiny meatballs, then as a main dish pasta with grilled chicken, cream sauce and dried tomato, they brought me tasteless chickeb cube barely cooked with an orange wierd sauce... disapointing for the price"
