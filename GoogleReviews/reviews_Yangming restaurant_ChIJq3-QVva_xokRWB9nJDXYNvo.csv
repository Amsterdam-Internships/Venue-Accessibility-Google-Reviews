1,Yangming restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We come here about once a month, and each time the food is delicious.  Typically we eat at the bar and the service from the bartender is very good.  The wine by the glass selection is pretty good too.  Parking is plentiful.  A great place when you'd rather not cook!"

9,Yangming restaurant, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Used to drive past this place coming home from work and thought it might be nice to take my girlfriend. We went and the food was very basic. Wasn't anything really special about the food. Sure there is some dishes that blow you away but …
10,Yangming restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Crab meat purses are the best thing ever in the entire world. The staff is nice and the food is immaculate. If you love won ton soup you HAVE to try theirs. Best around I promise you that. Yes it's a little pricey but completely worth it.
11,Yangming restaurant, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had a great time at a private event. Decent food and drinks. Great party room and dance floor. Decor is nice. My sister recommends coming for regular menu but she says it can be hit or miss.

16,Yangming restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good, portion size was reasonable as was the cost. There were a surprising number of non-Asian dishes on the menu. The decor was still lovely and the service was very good. I will certainly go back."
17,Yangming restaurant, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"My wife and I had takeout from here the other day. The Schezuan style chicken was very nutty, but tasty and full of mushrooms. The four flavor beef was even more delicious. The portions were well sized, but the prices here are a little steep. That said, it's much better than the usual Chinese food."
18,Yangming restaurant, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very disappointed in my most recent dinner at Yangming. Appetizer of bar-b-que spare ribs consisted of 4 ribs approximately 3.5"" long for $10.95. Absolutely absurd! You can get a half rack with a salad and two sides at most restaurants for approximately $15. The entire meal the portions were skimpy and the food was just mediocre."
19,Yangming restaurant, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We organized a family birthday party for 11 adults, 1 babysitter and 4 grandkids last Saturday night. They gave us a large room on the first floor at the back of the restaurant.  The staff could not have been more helpful and accommodating. …"

21,Yangming restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always love Yang Ming! But tonight my companion dropped an envelope containing cash, a large sum of cash. Before we could get into our car and leave the manager chased us down and returned the envelope. Honor is a gift one gives to oneself. Seeing such honor displayed has inspired me. Thank you so much!"
22,Yangming restaurant, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Somehow this is rated as ""The Best Chinese Food in the US"" - I'm not sure how.  It is good food, but not knock your socks off.  They have a nice dining area and it is suitable for large groups - just make a reservation."
23,Yangming restaurant, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"After re-opening initially  food was delicious but just last week take-out was so awful I threw it out. Won-ton soup was can of beef broth straight from can, strong & salty. The brown gravy with chicken & vegetables tasted rancid.  Will be going elsewhere."

We went to celebrate several family birthdays and it made an excellent birthday gift to all 5 of us."
27,Yangming restaurant, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place is amazing, was here 6 years ago when we lived in the area. And still has the same amazing food and amazing service. I knew we were good to go when we walked through the door to see the same familiar face of the host. The drinks …"

29,Yangming restaurant, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Went with a group, and some didn't show. Had a choice of 4 dishes, mostly ok. But when the bill came, we got charged for the people who couldn't make it. Back to Hunan in Ardmore. Better food, more choice. Smaller resturant, but seem like …"
30,Yangming restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Rumor has it that Yangming will be closing it's doors for good. I will miss it, superb food, at lunch and at dinner, good service and a landmark on Haverford Rd and the Ardmore/Bryn Mawr neighborhoods for many years. Good memories."
31,Yangming restaurant, 1 star ,6 years ago,"I was served an entree that had a live giant roach moving on top of the food!!! I summoned the waiter & he shrugged his shoulders & told me I would not be charged!!! I asked for the manager, but no one came!! Other diners near my table SAW …"

37,Yangming restaurant, 1 star ,10 years ago,"We hated this place. The ambience seemed nice at first. But it was a little dark with small spotlights that point to odd places around the table instead of, say, where the menu and food go. Then we noticed the flatware was dirty. The wonton …"

41,Yangming restaurant, 1 star ,6 years ago,"I have only tried Yangming's chicken, beef, and seafood dishes. I was not impressed at all, as none of it tasted truly fresh. It had obviously been frozen ages ago and then reheated. Yuck! And cockroaches are hardly Yanming's only problem: …"
