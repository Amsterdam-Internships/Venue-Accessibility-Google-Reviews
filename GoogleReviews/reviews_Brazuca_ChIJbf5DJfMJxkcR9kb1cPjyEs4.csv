0,Brazuca, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great coffee and friendly service. Love the cappuccino and the chai latte. The a√ßa√≠ breakfast bowl is also very good.
1,Brazuca, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Barzilian treats and nice coffee - a bit on the pricey side and not the fastest service. Great location for people watching as well.
2,Brazuca, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice Brazilian cafe. Good coffee, some local dishes made from acai."
3,Brazuca, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Stopped by for some chai latte. Delicious. Husband enjoyed the hot chocolate. Friendly staff. They offered free heated pastries due to closing time in an hour or so. They also offer loyalty stamp cards. Will come again! :)
4,Brazuca, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great coffee üëçüèº but the place small and busy
5,Brazuca, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Enjoyed the coffee and the atmosphere, but I wasn't really impressed by both. The perfectly circular finger ring of the cups gives you little grip to prevent them to rotate towards your hand and get scolded by the hot coffee. The cheesecake was quite good."
6,Brazuca, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favorite coffee bar around the corner. Not too big, so not too much noise. Suitable to both study/work and have lunch/coffee with friends. Luv their music selection which is mainly jazz, playing softly in the background. On the menu: coffee, thee, juices, acai bowls, sweets and bites; all sorts of loveliness from Brasil."
7,Brazuca, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent coffee, a bit pricey considering the rather modest interior. Waiting time is a bit long, they also brought me a small coffee even though I paid for a large one. The staff seems to be a bit confused when it's busy and tends to mix up the orders sometimes."
8,Brazuca, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pricey, but worth it
If you can bare to part with ‚Ç¨4 for a really good cup of coffee, do it here. The tiny terrace is always packed when the sun's out, but it's perfect for people watching in de Pijp."
9,Brazuca, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Staff was super friendly. So much indeed that i would like to give a better rating. I am not a coffee connoiseur so i cannot rate on that. The gin tonic I had instead tasted very watered down, sorry."
10,Brazuca, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Orderes a Latte to go, and had to wait 15 mins. Because the guy decided he needed to finish a large order for customers that were eating in. Pretty certain 'to go' stands for 'make it fast dear, don't have time to sit around'"
11,Brazuca, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place to enjoy Brazilian coffee!
12,Brazuca, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great coffee and friendly staff!
13,Brazuca, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious! And nice to sit outside at the lovely tables.
14,Brazuca, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We ordered and have been sitting for more than half and hour and they didn't notice that our order hadn't been made. We waited patiently. Didn't want to be rude. But you can't forget a client and an order, and serve everybody except us."
15,Brazuca, 1 star ,4 years ago,The most weird experience. We weren't allowed to order coffee to go because they were supposedly busy. And it wasn't even busy at all. Good ol' Amsterdam arrogance. Bubye!
16,Brazuca, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had a perfect flat white on the terrasse in the sun ‚òÄÔ∏è. Will go back to try the juices and a√ßa√≠ bowls as they look delicious!
17,Brazuca, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice people, good coffee, nice simple Brazilian treats, would prefer the juices to be made out of fresh fruits/berries."
18,Brazuca, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite place to enjoy a breakfast on a sunny terrace. I always go for a chai latte and a delicious aca√Ø bowl.
19,Brazuca, 1 star ,4 years ago,Ordering took us 5 min waiting for.the guy to.finish his speech with collegues.Waiting at the table for a cappuccino for at least 10min with the same guy wasting time talking with colleagues and laughing at us..brownie was concrete hard.just stop talking and learn some klantvriendelijkheid as you call it
