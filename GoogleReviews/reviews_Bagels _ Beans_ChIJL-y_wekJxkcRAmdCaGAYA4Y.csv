11,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Good food and drinks, friendly staff, nice vegan options"
12,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Probably one of our favorite chains ever. It felt like a local baegelry in every shop we visited between The Hague and Amsterdam. The prices are very good (especially on a budget) and the quality is fresh and delicious. Definitely get the Tapas if you feel like sharing.
13,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Second visit for bagels & beans. You would love this place! There's lots of options, but for me i really like the one with seaweed. And you can get freshly made tea here too. Good for breakfast or lunch"
14,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing! The hazelnut latte was the best I've ever had ( so I had two) and the tuna melt bagel was soooooo good! If I lived in Amsterdam I'd go here all the time! The staff were really friendly and upbeat too.

18,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We sat outside by the canal which was great. Good people watching if your into that. The food is mainly bagels and are all very tasty. No alcohol but the coffee is spot on. Our waiter was top shelf.

23,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best bagels ever. The waitress was really friendly and polite. The view is extraordinary. Sweet animals walking around and on the tables. I think the most delicious bagels are the mushroom burger with tomato bagel and the avocado with sesame bagel + pesto & sundried tomatoes. Fits perfect with still or sprankling water.
24,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty great bagels, awesome location! Only reason I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars was because I didn‚Äôt really have anything to compare it to..."

35,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food and drink was lovely, staff were not. The girl who served us did not ask if we were ready to order rather she just stood next to us silently until we told her we weren't ready just yet. After getting our drinks we ordered a brownie too ‚Ä¶"
36,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Not worth it the bad service, too crowded employees don't know who order what, takes really long time to clean the tables, desorganized"
37,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Love eating bagels here. The bagels are fresh they look good and taste fantastic. I suggest you also take the big coffee to really spoil yourself. Don‚Äôt go here during lunch if you wish to sit quietly but definitely worth going between 10-13 and 1430-1700
38,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredible breakfast, definitely get the mixed juice!!"
39,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I come here weekly, as it is very close to where I work. Can't praise quality if food and service enough.

41,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Food was ok, not great. Too pricey for what was offered. The place was dirty inside, the kitchen as well."
42,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice staff, fine bagels and warm atmosphere. A good place for a little break"
43,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly personnel but I would have appreciated if they cleaned the table a bit to get rid of the crumbs. It was crowded but it took very long to get the drinks and the nice bagels afterwards. The bagels were very tasty though.
44,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was delicious! Loved the chocolate melt and the tapas for two. The service was fine but nothing out of the ordinary. The only issue I had was that the washrooms were so gross! Puddles of water, no tissue paper, I didn't dare sit on the ‚Ä¶"

Love the gluten free options (I'm a celiac)"
46,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very yummy options but coming from the US I always feel like I'm paying a lot for a bagel. They always taste very good however and offer a comfy atmosphere to have breakfast/brunch. Also one of the few places to get a bagel in Amsterdam
47,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So fresh! Bread is very nice.
48,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Everything was super delicious! The pecan pie was fudgy vegan goodness, the large coffee was HUGE, and both of the bagels we tried were so satisfying. Our server was also really welcoming and kind. Perfect quick breakfast spot and great for dorky tourists like me."
49,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My husband is a Celiac and was able to eat pretty much everything. The gluten free Bagels were really tasty, you wouldn't have known it was gluten free. Would definitely go again and I would definitely recommend. Great selection for those who have dietary requirements and a great selection for those that can eat everything."
50,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food but apparently tap water is a one time thing.
51,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love Bagels & Beans so much! My go to in Amsterdam for delicious and tasty breakfast/lunch. They have gluten free bagels that taste so good! And you can also buy gluten free bagels that are frozen, to bring back home with you. Taste just as good when you make them at home!"
52,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent bagels, crunchy on the outside but still fluffy on the inside. The mango and orange juice were both fresh and delicious, and the matcha latte and hot chocolate were also both very good.

Waitress was a little bit rude and unfriendly"

61,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I like bagels, just not this location. Slow service, rude employees, and meddling people around. It is literally a place to stay out of. Everything is frozen and then reheated. And then imagine getting threatened for giving bad review. Haha sure sue me. Also mind that the owners will pop out of nowhere and give you an awkward time."
62,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice bagels, good coffee and pleasant atmosphere. I had the breakfast that included a bagle, jam, cream cheese, ham, cheese, a croissant thing, coffee and juice, for 11 euro. Most importantly, it was really nice."

70,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This cafe is super small so you might have to wait for a table (our wait was approximately 10 minutes). But it‚Äôs worth it! The bagels were yummy, and the drinks were interesting and well priced."
71,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,You can choose 6 different kind of dough and the bagels were tasty. A bit pricy honestly..more then 6 EUR for a filled bagel! I'd suggest to try tho.
72,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Bagels and Beans appears to be a chain of bagel cafes around Amsterdam. On a 3 day weekend in Amsterdam, various Bagels and Beans cafes became our regular brunch go to. They offer delicious, good value filled bagels which set you up well ‚Ä¶"

76,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I love Bagels & Beans, however, this venue was very disappointing. Compared to any other B&B in Amsterdam, even if it‚Äôs the same menu, the amount was amazingly different. Especially, the tiny 2 pieces of salmon made me shocked."

85,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The shop is messy. Ruble laying around, little bowls with sugar cubes standing on the tables probably all day, so not very hygienic. And worse, staff doesn't pay attention to their guests here. I even walked up to their counter to ‚Ä¶"

95,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I didn't eat anything but I got a bottle of coconut water and a chai latte all that probably would have preferred an actual Masala chai. but the most amazing thing was their iced coffee with cream , it really blew my mind.
