0,The Big Apple, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Would never choose somewhere like this, but luckily I read some reviews first and they were right - the staff are incredibly friendly and the steak was tender and perfectly cooked. Sides were also very welcome. They also own the Italian restaurant next door so we were able to have tiramisu for dessert, which was epic"

15,The Big Apple, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Friendly Staff, but the food is very poor quality. I had their signature burger and my girl had the rump steak. Burger was really dry and tasteless, the rump steak was really raw and chewy. We both experienced stomach cramps after. Unfortunately not the greatest experience at The Big Apple."
16,The Big Apple, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Read the reviews of the others and decided to give it a shot anyway. Service is so so, waitress seemed to be absent minded and her colleague really tried but has no clue how to properly serve. The rack of lamb was thoroughly undercooked, ‚Ä¶"

23,The Big Apple, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food, which makes everything else so disappointing. One table server could not be nice enough, the next ""less than efficient"" apparently you can't have some tap water for the table, you have to buy bottled water, is that ‚Ä¶"

27,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Must try!!! No really, the chef is amazing!!! Food was the best I had in Amsterdam. Very tasty and seasoned to perfection. Thank you for taking pride in your service. Lorenzo was fantastic, very professional. I would definitely recommend eating here.."
28,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had an amazing selection of meats here. Steaks, chicken fillets and ribs. It was all delicious and cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend visiting this establishment!"

30,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just enjoyed the all you can eat spareribs, the staff is amazing and really social. The restaurant has a really nice and modern look. And the price is really low! An amazing place to go eat. Keep it up!"
31,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was in the restaurante with my father and wife/kid and my father always complains about all the places. This time he didnt and to be honest I have to say that the Burger was really good. They served a burger like it should be, good meat and nice fries!"
32,The Big Apple, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"At first impression the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a cozy feel. The staff are pleasant but not overly friendly. However after 10 minutes and 10 YouTube ads for season 2 or Cobra Kai on YouTube red, the YouTube remix playlist ‚Ä¶"
33,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very friendly staff and the food (Burger and Steak) was fantastic.
34,The Big Apple, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Quite a descent meal, but nothing really special.
As reported in another comment; they do -not- serve water, even if it's next to a glass of wine. ‚Ä¶"
35,The Big Apple, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Mediocre: expensive for the quality of food. Careful when the waiter asks you if you want sauce with your fries as it's not free. The fries are 3 euros and again not included with the burger... The chipotle is a very far from what you ‚Ä¶
36,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Waited long to be given the menus, then another wait to have the order taken. The starters took about 30 minutes to arrive (it was about one third occupied). When they arrived, I received both my starter and main together, or I should say, ‚Ä¶"
37,The Big Apple, 1 star ,a year ago,"weird restaurant, i called ahead to make arrangements and use a groupon deal to eat there and make a reservation, the manager said its not a problem and you dont need to buy the groupon, you can eat here for the same deal as the groupon. ‚Ä¶"
38,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very good. Nice service. Would come again :)
39,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,I don't like writing bad reviews and I tend not to write but we ate there and the food wasn't very good (not horrible) definitely not worth the money. We ended up paying 5.5‚Ç¨ for what I'm sure was tap water and not a closed bottle of water ‚Ä¶
40,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We found this restaurant by accident but what a good find. We were here early evening 5.30 so it wasn't busy but we passed by on other nights and it was full. Waiter was really pleasant and we ordered vegan burgers with chips which were superb. It is only a small restaurant so would advise to book to avoid disappointment.
41,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The star is for the light taste of the truffle mayo in the hamburger. Nothing special for 16 euros. If you can walk a bit more, choose something more friendly and nicer. Very ‚Äúmeh‚Äù service and you have to pay for tab water (even if you have buy a bottle before)."
42,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,"After we waited for nearly an hour for our dishes we asked for our order. The waiter told us we could see it was nearly finished. We waited for another fifteen minutes until we left the restaurant without having had any food.
There were no apologies or explanations of the waiter!"
43,The Big Apple, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Place is very nice. Quality of meat is good but some choices are really weird. I took a New York steak and dish was full of koriander, that is strong and people might not like it, in particular because it heavily covers the taste of meat. ‚Ä¶"
44,The Big Apple, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I think the Burger is one of the best I ever had in Amsterdam. I tried the Black Angus that in my opinion is extremely cheap for the taste. I am giving 4 stars because of the service and the freaking expensive beer
45,The Big Apple, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We are waiting food for over an hour. I understand that it's Money20/20 event and a huge amount of people, but come on! If you don't have enough man power, then don't serve food on these events or cut the menu to burgers only or anything ‚Ä¶"
46,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Poor value, poor ingredients but even worse, zero pride in service or quality. Our party of four received contaminated toast, burned eggs and omelette, steak that tasted of liver and were charged for mayo. Would not recommend nor return. Disappointing."
47,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Excellent service and food. Highly recommend
48,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The burgers are even more basic than the most basic burger you could eat in your life, extremely low quality and high price for a basic burger, do not go here and save your money. Even the coffee we ordered was bad."
49,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very disappointing. The ¬´¬†French onion soup¬†¬ª is basically a small bowl of bouillon with some shredded cheese at the bottom of the bowl. No bread no cheese on top. Served on a bare old wooden plank... that‚Äôs what you get for ‚Ç¨7.50.  No value for you money. To be avoided.
50,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,High prices for small portions! If you order a soup it‚Äôs basically a mug of instant soup for ‚Ç¨7.50. Waiter was a cheeky wee guy with jokes that bordered on rude. I would never never visit this place again.
51,The Big Apple, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"If you just look for food to survive, it can do the job. If you want to eat a good burger, go somewhere else. Mayo is charge 0.75 ‚Ç¨...
I never post anything but this time, i had to do it. 4 stars in average is really overrated"
52,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"5 stars is a bit much perhaps but this is so much better than other places that I‚Äôve rated with 4 stars. Staff is great, atmosphere is great and the food is really good. From the main course to desert all very well done."
53,The Big Apple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice burgers and fries.
54,The Big Apple, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is nice and plentiful, although bit took more than an hour (on a Saturday night, but still) from walking in to being served. Good selection of drinks. Cozy atmosphere."
55,The Big Apple, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was okay-ish. However half of our group did not get what they ordered. Price was okay as well, however, paying was a hassle since they somehow did not manage to split it properly and tried to charge stuff twice."
56,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Extremely bad service, it took 1 hour and 30 minutes for three dishes to arrive. The manager was extremely rude when confronted about the waiting time. The food was underwhelming, the burgers were cold and the eggs were cold."

67,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Overcharged, meal was incomplete, charged for things they said was free, service was poor and arrogant. Disgrace. Massive price to boot."
68,The Big Apple, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Poor service (refused to serve tap water, didn't provide spoon for the soup, didn't bother to ask how we'd like our steaks done) but the food was all right."

70,The Big Apple, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If I have to value the meat of this place I'm very disappointed, we ordered two pieces and we have complained about the two. The service is good"
