0,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My first experience of GOOD IndonesiaNn food. If you visit, you have to go with the rice tables. Amazing sharing plates in generous sizes. I tried the vegetarian rice table (was amazing and a mix of starters (all three were great). The …"
1,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Simply fantastic. This small restaurant (holding approx. 50 or less) it's a great find in the food culture of Amsterdam. Definitely recommend to make reservations in advance. A must-try are their Rijsttafels or ""Rice Tables"" - comes with a …"
2,Tempo Doeloe, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant was quite full, so I was sat at the back with a bar to myself. Since I was completely removed from the fairly lively atmosphere in the main restaurant, you would hope that the food would be able to compensate. Unfortunately, …"
3,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,a year ago,Enak! Very tasty and authentic Indonesian Food! Definitely can recommend to visit this restaurant. The cook/waiter is also very nice and kind.
4,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food is not bad and it gives you a taste of different Indonesian-styles sauces. But the food ingredient itself is not so impressive. A con for not accepting card payment here.
5,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best Indonesian place in Amsterdam, a small place so book in advance or else door won’t open in front of you. Rice table ISTEMEWA 32 was one of the best from dinner menu"
6,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We came here on a recommendation from a couple friends of ours, and it definitely lived up to the hype. We ordered the full 18 course rice table for two, which I would highly recommend doing! Great dining experience in Amsterdam!"
7,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very much hit or miss, could be a lot less than 4 stars depending on food choices. …"
8,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely delicious Indonesian food. Huge menu with simple yet fantastic dishes. Lots of people try the samplers, but their other prepared menus are great as well. Definitely worth a trip when in Amsterdam"
9,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Wasn't spicy as expected! Very sluggish service. We had to ask more than twice for what we ordered.
10,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food! Very helpful staff (spoke multiple languages), offered recommendations and explained the dishes. It came highly recommended to us and we were not disappointed!"
11,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was pretty good but service was bad...really lacking. People used to love it more as they were much better overall.
12,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was pretty good but restaurant wasn't welcoming. Staff were very concerned with seating us at the smallest possible table, pressuring us to order drinks, hurrying us through our meal, and then oddly not bringing us our bill. Also …"
13,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The service was perfectly fine in my case, but I found the food fairly tasteless. Indonesian fare can be a hit or miss even in Indonesia (IMO), but while the portions and the variety were both generous, and the food was very fresh, I was disappointed and underwhelmed by the flavors."
14,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, true Dutch-Indonesian experience. The restaurant is very tiny so don't expect to be able to sprawl and have your elbows on the table (which moms should say it's impolite anyway, so). It is a bit on the expensive side but it is …"
15,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had to have rijsttafel during our quick visit to Amsterdam and this is there we were directed for among the best.  We loved it!  We had the 24 dish plate and our taste buds were tantalized  by the most delicious and savory meat and …
16,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"You will not regret eating here. Make a reservation as the restaurant is small and they don't rush you eating. The food looks like small portions but it's a lot. Careful with the spicy dishes, they mean SPICY. Everything was delicious! Thanks to Bourdain for recommending the best Indonesian food Amsterdam has to offer."
17,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Average food, a bit pricey
Maybe it’s me but I find Indonesian food in Amsterdam a bit bland. Especially compared to Thai and Malaysian. …"
18,Tempo Doeloe, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service 2
Food 3
Overall 2.5 …"
19,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A well-known Indonesian restaurant in Amsterdam. Very busy. Reservation is a must. Probably because of that, we had quite a high expectation. Food has a range of taste from sweet, mild to spicy. But we are not that impressed. Service is …"
20,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,a year ago,"Food is overpriced and tasteless, we ordered vegetarian dishes that costed as much as the meat options and we were very disappointed. It was bland and boring. The waitress was quite surprised when we asked for salt, so clearly they don’t use it. Overall, not a pleasant experience"
21,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Best Indonesian restaurant in Amsterdam. It might be too spicy if you are not used to it. Their taste is rich and variety. Delicate interior and table setting is also nice. I invited several times my clients for business dinner.
22,Tempo Doeloe, 2 stars ,5 years ago,A great little restaurant. It came highly reccomended. The lady that runs it is half Dutch and half Indonesian and was very kind to accommodate us even though our hotel screwed up the reservation. She even offered us a drink at the bar on …
23,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Indonesian food, we had the veggie rice table and everything was good. I could have gone for a bit more spice but the food was overall quite tasty and worth the short walk. …"
24,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Had booked a table for two for our final night in Amsterdam after hearing  from a tour guide about this place. We'll we sat down, and that's the last time we got any sort of service. We caught the attention of one waitress, who rudely told …"
25,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I recently returned to visit Amsterdam for work and could not leave without eating some Indonesian food. I had my usual beef rendang and they were wise to give me half and half - half mild and half spicy- the mild for me is very mild and …
26,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"What excellent food! We had the 24 dish tasking menu and it was unreal. It's easy to see why they only made bib gourmand with Michelin, as their service is quite surly. Also they do not 'serve tap water' and instead charge 7 euro for …"
27,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I’ve lived in Amsterdam for 6 months, and this is by far the worst restaurant I’ve been too. To start the door has a doorbell, which is a bit odd and unwelcoming. The staff said they do not serve tap water. …"
28,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Stay away! Bad food for way too much money! The rice table, that costs 40 euro per person, is totally not worth it. Half of it is just simple lettuce salad (warm, how gross) and there is even a dish including liver meat (which they didn't …"
29,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good Indonesian. We got the tasting menu which was incredible and really well priced (around 35 euros). The green bean dish was my personal fav. If you love spicy, go for the 3 star spice menu"
30,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Fun presentation but it was allright indo food... great to entertain and have some fun at the table with all the moving parts to the dishes, but coming from real indo and loving delish food, again allright."
31,Tempo Doeloe, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"There was a time that Tempo Doeloe represented a class on its own regarding Indonesian food and quality. I am afraid that time is long gone. Recently, I visited this place and ordered a ricetable. The food was mediocre,  service was …"
32,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,a year ago,"Okay the food itself is pretty flavourful but the value of the rijstafel (ricetable) is so just bad compared to other Indonesian restaurants in Amsterdam which are just as good or better. Many reviews here say the food is enough, but for us …"
33,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty and abundant meal! Friendly and discreet staff.
Menus for 2 are more than enough...for 2!
Few choices for wines and other beverages...but is this really the point of an authentic Indonesian restaurant?"
34,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Make sure to check the spicy scale on the menu. Food was pretty good. I enjoyed it for the most part. Waiting staff was nice and pleasant. It's just pretty expensive.
35,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful restaurant; fantastic wait staff and flavorful food that took me straight back to Bali. We thoroughly enjoyed the 18-dish rijsttafel “rice dish” that ranged from mild to knock your socks off spicy at the end. Wonderful combination.
36,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I did not have Indonesian before so can't say about originality. The rice table last option was more than enough. At 39€ pp not so vfm. The wine was not that good. The last dish was very spicy but nice.
37,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,2 years ago,Extremely over priced for what it is. Felt sick paying 240 EUR for 4 adults and 2 kids - totally not worth it. Service ok but the venue is old and tired. Food too spicy for average eater.  Don’t waste your money.
38,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great Indonesian rijsttafels. Absolutely deliciously flavoured dishes, which are served in order of spiciness. From mild to very spicy. With a rijsttafel you know you'll leave the building with a food baby in your belly. So did we, but the …"
39,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"If I live in Amsterdam, I'd come here every other week. It was my first time trying Indonesian food. Loved its set of richly spiced small dishes. Staff were nice!"
40,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Make sure you make a reservation or come when the restaurant when it opens.  The restaurant had to turn people away the whole time.  Try one of the rice menu combos and try some dishes.  The food is authentic and the spice level is real.  We really enjoyed our dinner.
41,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Went there this evening and was happy to be welcomed in and found a table for four, my wife and I and two of our children. But after sitting there for 25 minutes with servers attending to all the tables around us, We had not been given a …"
42,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing authentic Indonesian. You must book - we had reservations at 8:30 and the restaurant was so booked that we didn’t get seated until 9:30. Worth it for the food though - especially the 18 dish tasting menu.
43,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We have been at your restaurant last Sutarday for dinner. After waiting over 1 hour and twenty minutes not being served, we've been asked if we want to pay by cash or credit card. So we decided to leave the restaurant. Never been in such unprofessional place before. We expected the best but experienced the worst. Shame."
44,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I'd give it six but some might not like the awful delays getting in( Door closed. Rang bell four times. No answer. Let self in by grabbing a handle at base of door. Not welcomed when we eventually got in),a seat(even when you've booked), …"
45,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very slow, not impressive and mediocre food.. and bad service. Better go when fed and hydrated! By all means, there are way better and tasty places that can offer value for money. This was a rip off based on historical popularity. By the …"
46,Tempo Doeloe, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Service is really slow, expect to wait at least an hour for your food. Food is so-so, could get better Indonesian for a better price. Waiters are unfriendly, look harassed, they don’t smile. Tables cramped inside it’s hard to move without your elbows hitting another person. Will not go back and will not recommend this to anyone."
47,Tempo Doeloe, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"My friend and I visited this restaurant due to its famous remarks by Anthony Bourdain. We were excited to try authentic Indonesian cuisine, but we at first were shocked by the prices for their famous ""ricetables"". We asked the waiter …"
48,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"My experience here wasn’t so positive. After being seated at my reserved table, I waited 20 minutes before I asked for water and a menu. When the rijsttafel finally arrived, it was dropped off without explanation. It tasted tired, maybe reheated. Service was very scarce, spread too thin. Tourist trap?"
49,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Honestly this is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The food is incredible and words won’t do it justice to describe ever bite you take.... I will be definitely coming for more ever time I’m in town.
50,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a small cramped family-owned Indonesian  place. The decor needs a revamp. Service is notoriously slow but friendly. Four stars because, while mainly catering to tourists, the food is still excellent."
51,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful Indonesian restaurant. The food is in very high quality and very authentic, they even explain how Indonesian food should be eaten to those who never tried it. It is a little pricey but definitely worth the money."
52,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Last time I ate at Tempo Doeloe was more then 20 years ago. As an so called Indo with Indo European parents I think that I know how a rijsttafel should taste. I give the food a 8, but the service was far below what u could expect for this …"
53,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This Vegan meal was simply amazing. We had a rice sampler with many dishes.  Service was great.  Food was great. Will definitely be back.
54,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Make sure you make ressos! My boyfriend and I tried to come here on our first night without reservations at around 9 pm on a Saturday, and they said they were completely booked for the rest of the night. So we made it for another night and …"
55,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Service was very slow. I think our waiter actually got fired mid service after getting into fight with boss lady. The manager/owner lady took over and was grumpy. Food was decent not great. Maybe we went on a bad night.  Expensive and probably not worth a revisit
56,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"One of my favorite restaurants anywhere in the world!  Tempo Doeloe was recommended to me by a colleague with local ties to Amsterdam - so I knew this would be special, something not found in any ""Let's Go."" …"
57,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Huge disappointment, this place is FAR too proud of itself, pretentious, and pretending to be something it is not.  First off, don't make the mistake I did by watching Anthony Bourdain's tv show 'The Layover' and thinking this is the same …"
58,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,14 years ago,"I've been coming to Tempo Doeloe from Chicago for the past 10 years and it remains one of my favorite places in Amsterdam. From the moment you walk in the door, you are warmly greeted by the staff (and often by the owner, himself). Although …"
59,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Really good food and pleasant staff. The staff were very busy, though, so we had to wait longer than we thought was reasonable on a couple of occations. Would definitely go back anyway; great overall experience!"
60,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,3 years ago,i have never in my life witnessed a hostess take more pleasure and enjoyment from turning customers away than i did here at Tempo Doeloe. We arrived at 9:40pm for dinner last Saturday night and were told the kitchen was closed. I asked what …
61,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent food, spicy or mild, at your feeling. Staff very pleasant, always willing to help. Reservation highly recommended. But as the  room is full, it's a bit too noisy."
62,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great restaurant if you like extremely spicy food. Definitely try the rice table. Make a reservation before you go. It's a small and busy place.
63,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best I've eaten in a decade! Flavorful, with each dish very different from the other. And you can choose you level of spice (for some dishes)."
64,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Took the most 'complete rijsttafel' and it was amazing. Good build-up in spiciness and deliciously surprising flavours in every dish - and of course a real Bintang.
Highly recommended."
65,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent food, friendly service, though a bit too formal - ordering took quite long because one member of the company was late. Reservation is absolutely necessary, also during the week."
66,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Meh, I don’t get the hype. Food is only ok, so not worth the hike or price to me. Had to try it to know I guess. The chicken screwer in peanut sauce was the tastiest item I had."
67,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice restaurant quality food  portions could be bigger. need a reservation. Place is small and when fully booked can feel a little cramped
68,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great service! We had a really nice time at Tempo Doeloe. The staff is kind and helpful and the food was delicious. We will definitely eat here again.
69,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent food and great seevice. Definitely a must visit for Indonesian food in Amsterdam. Make sure you make a reservation.
70,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderfully prepared Indonesian food..the rice tables are recommended to get a real taste of the culinary spectrum on offer.
71,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,a year ago,Every now and then I love coming here for authentic Indonesian food. Staff is also friendly.
72,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good restaurant. Very busy with fast and friendly service. Definitely recommend reservations. Lots of tasty dishes.
73,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Extremely slow service, simple food and normal taste. What did we pay 65euro each for?
It feels like this city is filled with scam like this."
74,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty decent Indonesian food. The menu were satay, rendang and some others I didnt remember. Taste okay."
75,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food quality above average but not spectacular. Staff were friendly enough. The space is cramped and noisy.
76,Tempo Doeloe, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been coming here for thirty years. The portions are halved, service is unfriendly and the food is not too bad. Real shame."
77,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was ok, very busy place, but veryyyy pricey! Bottle of water for 7.50 euro?!? It’s an experience for sure but very expensive."
78,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Incredible food, friendly service. For first timers I would recommend getting a rice plate to share as it gives you a great variety of things to try!"
79,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing service, friendly people, unbelievable food, trust them when they say the spicy dishes are spicy! Delicious."
80,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Best ""rijsttafel"" in Amsterdam. Watch out for the rendang, it can be very, very spicy but still delicious."
81,Tempo Doeloe, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was pretty good. Small restaurant. Found it a little pricey but overall decent value.
82,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food and really friendly service. Considering the group of 12 we came in as service was very satisfactory. Would definitley reccomend
83,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love this food. First time revisiting after moving abroad many years ago and its just as good.
84,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent rijsttafel really really good. Make a reservation well in advance as is very popular and relatively small.
85,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"There are many different Indonesian dining choices in the city, but I think this one is the best."
86,Tempo Doeloe, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is ok and food is good, but very expensive for what it is, and they refuse to serve tap water, which is unacceptable in my point of view."
87,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely nice service and food. We really enjoyed the evening.
88,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Decent Indonesian food
89,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food and service.  There were three of us and we had a great time.

92,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food building up spice. Friendly waiters. Must come back!!

94,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great authentic food, good quantities and nice staff"
95,Tempo Doeloe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great dining experience.
96,Tempo Doeloe, 1 star ,5 years ago,Wouldn't give me a glass of tap water with my meal.  I could only get one if I bought a drink off the menu first.
97,Tempo Doeloe, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Don't know what to say apart from it was the best meal I've ever had.
