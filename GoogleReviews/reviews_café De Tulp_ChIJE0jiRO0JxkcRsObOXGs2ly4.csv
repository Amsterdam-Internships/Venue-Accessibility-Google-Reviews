0,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I really liked this place, the atmosphere is very youthful, you can appreciate the sunset is you sit in the outside tables, enjoy the music, but if you prefer the inside it‚Äôs cool too, with nice lights and decoration. ‚Ä¶"
1,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"There was a lane and it was pretty busy, but you can also have the option to sit inside and then the lane isn‚Äôt that long anymore. The place looks exotic and gives some nice vibes. While paying everything there was a mistake but that was ‚Ä¶"
2,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Fun atmosphere for an evening with friends; plenty of drinks to choose from; especially liked the Moscow Mule pitcher. They have quite a spacious terrace with heaters for the colder months.
3,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great spot to eat and then dance. Food and drinks were both very good. Service was decent as well. It turns into a club type vibe later in the evening with a DJ playing.
4,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"They have an espresso martini tree?!. I think the 5 stars, thus, are self explanatory. I actually did not order it because I lacked the financial means but best believe that one day I will! Also the waiters can carry so many glasses at once ‚Ä¶"
5,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Colourful and original decor. üå∑üåµüçπ
It's a good place to go out with friends and have a drink."
6,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,5 months ago,"The place looks great but the food and service were sadly bad. The fries smelled quite strange and the banana bread was very dry. Our food was mostly served cold, a sandwich had a long hair stuck in it, a glass still had lipstick stains on ‚Ä¶"
7,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Funky bar/restuarant with a lively ambiance. The indoor is a bit like a plastic forest with lights and decorations. Outdoor seating is fun and a great place to people watch. Amazing selection of beer and drinks. Food is good. Staff are friendly.
8,caf√© De Tulp, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"The restaurant itself is nice but the food is really poor. The taste and flavor of  the food are poor, some of them was serve cold. Not worth the money. The waiters and staff was nice and friendly but definitely better to eat some else. ‚Ä¶"
9,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Worse service ever. Super slowly. We had to wait 30 Minutes, until we could order drinks, they forgot the fork and knife for my food. I had to ask 3 times until i got it. They didnt clean the table. We also had to ask 2 times for it until they did it. The location is beautiful but all in all i would never go there again."
10,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,It gets crowded during the week and in the weekdays. Booking is only for inside so you can‚Äôt book the terrace. It‚Äôs a nice bar with nice bar food. The nachos are incredible
11,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Food is overpriced and most 'shared main dishes' that we ordered where way to small to actually share.
Food tasted good but our service was very slow and lacking. Took at least 10 min ‚Ä¶"
12,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Telling your own clients they can't use the restroom inside because of the lack of Covid QR code is NOT gonna cut it, sorry. 0 stars. ‚Ä¶"
13,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The service is always good. Drink on the table immediately, food is good and the area is beautiful. Always packed with nice people and in general a very good place to have a sit qith your friends and enjoy."
14,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"10 out of 10 for food and atmosphere. Best dish was the truffle croquettes, and the squid. The only thing that sucked was that we could smell the toilet. Most disappointing dish was the scallops."
15,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great place to hang out for some after office drinks. Great service and variety of drinks and snacks. Loved the vibe and atmosphere of the place.
16,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy restaurant with very friendly and relaxed people working there. The interior is very cool and hip while the outside seats are great to chill in the sun!
The menu is very diverse and you get snacks, cakes and small dishes at average prices :) Would recommend when you're around!"
17,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Gezellig! Nice atmosphere both inside and outside. Drinks are nice and small bites too (we suggest you the pulpo and the bacalao croquettes). Average price
18,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very nice place. Not touristic. Young vibes. We sat outside. We asked for tap water for numerous times before getting some.
19,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"There are a few reasons why I need to give it a three. I love the place and the vibe, with the trees inside and the leaves (it feels like you are having drinks in the jungle). The fries are excellent as well as the shrimp croquettes. But ‚Ä¶"
20,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Definitely one of the coziest bars in Amterdam, sit inside and the vibe is amazing. However, near the end of the week I would reserve."
21,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great bar to start the evening. We just had drinks. The cocktails were tasty, the staff was super friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was unique."
22,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice bar and people! Good prices and well done on the terrace. Recommended
23,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We come here every visit to Amsterdam! Always a good meal, service and great vibe. Food was fast and flavorful :)"
24,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I had an amazing time it was my last day in Amsterdam and it was just perfect salsa Bachata and amazing people!!
Get paid to travel that‚Äôs the life!
Dance your way to the top ;)"
25,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice bar and staff so friendly, inside got good music and big enough, restrooms clean, price ok"
26,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"As an argentian person, it's very nice to find this little place, mostly packed with locals, but with latino music. The night I visit the place, salsa, bachata and merengue music was being played. They even have a little dance floor. Prices were just fine for their expert staff attention."
27,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Super cool place in which we ended up by a complete coincidence (no other cafe or restaurant nearby had a toilet inside). Definitely worth it, mainly because of the exotic decor inside and out, simple ordering system and reasonable prices‚ò∫Ô∏è"
28,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"A lovely large terrace, colourful, private and safe with acrylic panels to shield customers. Friendly and proactive staff. Nice selection of beers"
29,caf√© De Tulp, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice cosy place in the Pijp, also the service was friendly. I just got annoyed when my 33cl glass of German white beer was 30% foam and then got charged 5 euro for it. I regret I didnt say anything, at the same time, no serious bartender can allow a beer to go out like that."
30,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely, artsy place for a bite or drinks. Amazing vibe and fabulous staff."
31,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"They do not do reservations for the terrace and you have to wait in a long line. Fortunately, the day I went (Wednesday) the line was moving relatively quickly."
32,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic bar restaurant. Went there for beers and nachos. Great service, fantastic music, best nachos ever had in Amsterdam.  Will go back."
33,caf√© De Tulp, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice vibe, but slow unhappy staff and the food was more like a fine dining snackbar."
34,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Visited De Tulp last week for the first time!
Really liked the fact that you are able to order and pay online, so you do not have to wait for the waiter to come and get your order or bring you a bill. ‚Ä¶"
35,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great place to have a drink within the Pijl. I don‚Äôt necessarily recommend it to eat here, unless it‚Äôs for a salad, they are quite good.  De Tulp is a place with a very lovely atmosphere. There are mainly locals, and just a few tourists ‚Ä¶"
36,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Love that (usually) the place turns into a nightclub at night.
37,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Fantastic local with a unique vibe both indoors and out. Don't go here looking for a world class experience, it's Amsterdam and it's true to its roots while keeping it casual with a wide range of drinks and a publike menu. The terrace is well positioned for a sunny day and a few too many with friends."
38,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not really one of my favourite places but always nice for a few drinks. The music is very unpredictable, one day you get alternative music, the other some Latin vibes, you never know. Bartenders are not exactly friendly and seem somewhat ‚Ä¶"
39,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We came here to eat with a group of 10 for a birthday party and stayed for some drinks afterwards. ‚Ä¶
40,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,a year ago,"This is a cute little place in the city center of Amsterdam. It looks so much smaller on the outside than it actually is. Drinks were nice, as well as the snacks we had. The atmosphere is chill. Unfortunately the service wasn't great, we ‚Ä¶"
41,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The ambience alone is enough to go there if you like indoors. If not there's always the nice terrace on Marie heinekenplein
42,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice bar, music meh, more like party kind of vibe. Spent like 15 minutes here. Also theres free entrance."
43,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food and atmosphere - 5 stars (delicious, hip cuisine)
Staff - 2 stars (slow and sometimes rude)"
44,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best bar/restaurant of Amsterdam!! Their ambiance is amazing, it really looks like you are in a jungle. Their food is so good and the staff is really polite. You must visit this place!"
45,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,5 months ago,Had to wait for more then 30 min for a order. Or it got cancelled. The tables where dirty.
46,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Very slow service, took longer than 1 hour to get my drink"
47,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Good ambiance, but slow staff and a bit pricy"
48,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun place to hang out for a couple drinks

I can't really say more than that on the review as that's all I remember. If we ‚Ä¶"
49,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great service and yummy food.
50,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a week ago,Great place to go after work on Friday for having some drinks and tasteful bites.
51,caf√© De Tulp, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Snackfood is good. Service terrible.

I am not sure if the always forget the alcohol in my cocktails or the cocktails ‚Ä¶"
52,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Roberto, best chef In Town. The truffle pasta was the best I ever had"
53,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place to spend your eve. Dinner is nice (tapas style, slightly above Dutch standards) and it comes at a reasonable price. The place then turns more into a bar/club from 11pm onwards and it gets packed fairly quickly on weekends."
54,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went on Latin Night (Tuesdays) and the atmosphere was everything one could ask for. Good DJ, reasonably priced drinks, and lots of great social dancers. Went on a hot night, though, and there wasn't much circulation so it felt a bit like dancing in a sauna."
55,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I've only been there a few times and never for food, but I find it the perfect place for drinks. The prices are rather normal and the Brick G&T and their Mojito really do the job. Pleasant atmosphere for an evening out with friends!"
56,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is one lovely place you can find De Pijp, excellent service and awesome selection of food and drinks!"
57,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice special oriental/jungle interior and terrace. Really like the style, but it gets really crowded inside in the nights. The strict door policy, rules about smoking area and leaving drinks inside after 10pm will be inevitable if you're located on this square but turns down the atmosphere."
58,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"De Tulp has a great outdoor terrace. Lots of space to have a drink with friends, no matter how large the group. When on the terrace they uphold a self service (order at the bar inside) rule. They will serve you good outside once ordered ‚Ä¶"
59,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I love it here, it's fun and relaxed. Food and drinks are good, terrace nice and vast. Service is friendly and prices reasonable."
60,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is cool and the drinks are good, however some of the staff (the host) was very rude with me and my friends. She took one of the stools we were sitting on but was empty at that very moment, because the place was full, even though ‚Ä¶"
61,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, tropical tikithemed - the beers are exceptionally small - a large beer is what you'd expect a normal sized beer to be sizewise. Also if opening a tab be very sure that the staff dont add any extra items to it.  In our case 3 beers were suddenly 9, which took a stern word to fix."
62,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Perfect service (thanks Nino) and very enjoyable food & drinks! We‚Äôll be back very soon! :)
63,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,a year ago,"Last week I ordered a glas of Cr√©mant (as I came to celebrate something with my daughters) How disappointing ! Glas was half full, no bubbles at all as I think the bottle was already open for a while ......  the taste was not worth the price!!!!! I won't come again"
64,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Love the interior which is very cosy like an indoor garden. However!! Bar staff didn't really know much about gin. Looks like a cocktail bar but it isn't because there is no passion in the way alcoholic beverages are served.
65,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super trendy place with a really good bar and al la carte menu. Good bunch of good looking cats all there for a good time. Gets shoulder to shoulder busy after a while so you really get to know your neighbours
66,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place to eat or drink. Great jungle/nature atmosphere on the inside and good variety of drinks, not to mention the great service. Definitely will visit again"
67,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly stuff, quick service, warm atmosphere."
68,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We have been there in the night to party. Place itself is designed nice but that‚Äôs about it:
- waiters are unfriendly and unorganized ‚Ä¶"
69,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the cool place if you want to have a drink in De Pijp. You can enjoy a jungle kind of atmosphere. During the week end, music goes live and everybody is up for a dance which make it perfect if you want to without going out on a nightclub. Right in-between solution."
70,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great vibrant spot to have some fun and drinks, just loving the interior and colourful terrace! Food is also delicious!"
71,caf√© De Tulp, 2 stars ,2 years ago,It's a really cool place by plants and atmosphere! But it's unbelievable the way the doorman treats guests. Never experienced such thing. Would not recommend it because of that
72,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great place for both drinks & dinner. Good vibes always, def helped by the nice staff!"
73,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The blonde haired waitress with the Blue eyes is looking awesomeüëå(seen at the B√§r)
74,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,4 years ago,Terrible service. Waited a half hour before I could get someone‚Äôs attention. Ordered a beer. Waited another hour. Nothing came. Left. Not to mention the manager gave me a talking to for being too expressive in my conversation and when she realized we were Dutch speakers she tried to back pedal.
75,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The place to go for a üçª with your friends or a snack, gin & tonic, nice lemonades during bright summer evening. Lots of locals and young people."
76,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very lovely bar. Loved the decoration. Nice to get drinks with friends.
Very crowded on a Thursday night though."
77,caf√© De Tulp, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The quality of the service is bad. One time the waitress didn‚Äôt even look at us, let us sit 20 minutes before sighingly taking the order and at the end handed over the wrong bill. 2 points just for the great interior."
78,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Warm and intimate setting. Food is delicious. They also have english menus. Ask for recommendations. The staff here is excellent. I would eat here again in a heartbeat.
79,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Service was awful, it‚Äôs impossible to split the bill while we were with over 10 people. Servers were very rude. Bringing a glass of wine and some beer took forever. Second time here and I got very disappointed for the second time."
80,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,10 months ago,"Go here if you want to support a business that doesn‚Äôt pay its staff correctly.
Read about it in a magazine in the near future"
81,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere. Very busy. Bar service a bit slow, and they kept running out of jugs! So you had to go back more often."
82,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible, we were with the three of us and were denied entry because there weren't any ladies present with us at that time. afterwards 6 guys were allowed in (they were alone, as in without any ladies present ) because they apparently knew the bouncer. Extremely terrible service (racism? We are three African guys)."
83,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere and decoration, cosy place!"
84,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food is ok. Service is very rude . We had our lunch and 2 of us decided to have water with our lunch . At the end the waitress came and ask if ""we wanted something to drink apart from water"". No need for that . Never again . Hope they fix it ..."
85,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Extremely busy, cramped and loud! Not a place you would go to for chilled dtinks. It's very beautiful inside with the greenery."
86,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great music, friendly and happy atmosphere. No entrance fee. Great drinks. Great for dancing after 10pm and good for dinner and snacks"
87,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice environment. Very good beer and drinks. Gets quite busy on weekends

90,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is a great place to just hang with your mates and drink a few beers. On Tuesdays they have salsa nights and it's deffinitely allot of fun.
91,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great services and the QR code to get u drinks it's just fantastic especially now because of corona
92,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice to sit outside with sunny weather. In the evening it can take a lot of time to order beer because everyone here seems to order cocktails
93,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, cool interior. Latin music,  cocktails; beer and wine. We didn't have food but the nachos looked good :)"
94,caf√© De Tulp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I was there for the salsa night on tues, nice atmosphere and crowd but the ceiling lights are kind of low, I kept hitting them while dancing."
95,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Feels like being in the jungle! What a cool vibe üêÜ french fries had a nice twist and were SUPER delish! I will definitely come back for more.
96,caf√© De Tulp, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Grear bar but their 'plankjes' are a disgrace. 23 bucks for 3 tiny bowls of appertizers, won't fill a grown man. Improve the food, i beg you."
97,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place feels like an indoor garden. Very nice place to have a drink with a friend. The service was fast. Worth a visit!
98,caf√© De Tulp, 1 star ,3 years ago,"""I don't care what will you put on Google"" - that is what manager of this place told me after my complain that they for 3 times poured  me water from their not fixed water sink at the bar counter. So, great attitude, good luck for the future...."
99,caf√© De Tulp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,AMAZING FOOD! For a touristy area it is the best we hqve had. Staff are friendly and would highly recommend
