0,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"I ordered Butcher with Cheese with extra jalape√±o. Burger was juicy and meat was good. Burger bun was fresh and perfect. Fries were also really great, but I really want to try their sweet potato fries the next timeüòã"
1,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited the restaurant after a long day. The shop is not far away from the city centre, around 10 with 15 minutes. It's located in a quiet peaceful street with many shop that hosts every morning a flee market. ‚Ä¶"
2,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Best burger of the city! Very delicious meat, well cooked and well served. You even eat with your eyes first. The staff is really friendly and the music in the background puts you in a happy mood."
3,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Nice burger from nice beef meat but a bit expensive.
4,The Butcher, 5 stars ,7 months ago,It seemed like a fast food burger place but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the burger.
5,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place was recommended by a friend of mine and we where glad we ate here. This place hands down has the best burger in Amsterdam. Will definitely recommend this to all and will be coming back.
6,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Well we came because of recommendations. It is  a good burger. But! It's not that amazing. As a burger lover I like my burgers more juicy and meaty but dont get me wrong! It's good and will be a great lunch but not a burger you will remember in any amazing way (hope you can understand what I am trying to say)
7,The Butcher, 4 stars ,11 months ago,Loved the smell of the flame-grilled burger. The sweet fries on the other hand were a bit burnt and didn't taste good.
8,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing burgers and a great selection. The beef is fresh and tastes great, the toppings are also amazing. This is not a place for a quick eat, it takes time to get the burgers because the make them properly with patience and love."
9,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good size burger,but the meat should have been more juicy.and the bread was kinda dry.
Its good but ‚Ç¨15 for a burger with fries is a bit too much for a burger thats not that special!"
10,The Butcher, 1 star ,5 days ago,"Ok burgers, terrible service, as in no service at all. Unfortunately didnt deliver everything was ordered and paid, and does not reply to emails."
11,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Not bad
12,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Okay burgers. Not amazing, but not bad."
13,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good meat tasty! Hamburger size larger than other places it makes difference. Soft and enough cooked with blood inside. Different of other places in Europe where hamburger is very dry.
Fries with mayo was good as well."
14,The Butcher, 1 star ,4 months ago,I ordered take away and the delivery man said they forgot an item from the order and that he had to go back. The order was finally delivered an hour later and everything is cold. And it‚Äôs pretty close distance (15 minutes walking). Such a huge disappointment!!!
15,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The daddy was delicious. It can be busy,  but you can order while waiting (Only problem is that sometimes the burgers are ready sooner then any seating becoming available). But still worth it üòÑ"
16,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Ate here for the second time already. What can I say. There are better burgers in Pijp, for my taste at least. And their fries are American style, now Dutch style, which I couldn't help but notice. If you like your burgers bloody, that maybe a place for you though."
17,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favorites. Sit inside and you will smell like a burger but who cares when they are so delicious. I order the Daddy with 250gr beef.... like always
18,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"here the hamburger is the best in town but tonight was especially tasty, two friendly characters work, great team üçîthank you guy's"
19,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Quite impressive interior space and tasty burger !!!!! Not quite fall in love with bread but also pairs well. Love the bgm there üíÉ
20,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The burger was awesome, I believe that he is the best I. Amsterdam"
21,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice burger, good fries, but very hot and smelly place due to the open kitchen. Also, they might let you know before you pay for sauce that ketchup and mayo are free..."
22,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,When I went to the butcher I was expecting a high-end burger but was sadly a bit surprised that this is more of a fastfood style restaurant. For these price you easily find better burgers in Amsterdam! ‚Ä¶
23,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I must say, I have had a lot of burgers in my time, but this has jumped straight in at No. 1 in my best burger list. Superb, tasty, most and beautifully cooked.
Thank you. üòãüòã"
24,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"we've visited in late evening, so street market was gone, there's a little place with 10-15 seats of all 4 tables. we've got burger sets on menu.. in my opinion a bit pricey compare to others with less juicy beef.. in case you like much fries, i recommend this shop.."
25,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Silence of the lambs was great choice and also sweet potato fries is different taste to try. Theres also private party inside.
26,The Butcher, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food. Not a good night bar. Such a shame, the set up is really cool. Music was not great nor service..."
27,The Butcher, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The space is quite small. The burgers are tasty, they also have vegetarian and chicken burger."
28,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best burgers of the city , small place just 4 tables, friendly staff."
29,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best burger of the city in my opinion. Good service. Ask for the butcher with cheese and sweet potato fries. You won't regret it.
30,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good and tasty Burgers!
31,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Burgers, yes, excellent burgers. If you are hungry and close by don't think it twice. It's not a place where you'll spend an entire afternoon but you won't regret. Look for the butcher ""secret parties"" as well ;). Approved by quiquinn."
32,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice burger grilled to order (medium or medium well). Fries were a bit disappointing and the seating is a little tight, but the meat was flavorful and reasonably priced."
33,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great burgers and fries. Good quality ingredients and big portions. Only 3 small tables available. Accept cards
34,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best beef meat that I've ever eaten. I strongly recommend this place! It's a must to order from the sweet potatoes..
35,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing burgers! The place is somehow, special. The quality of the burger is spectacular, and the taste goes with it. Friendly staff."
36,The Butcher, 5 stars ,11 months ago,The Butchers are the best burger restaurant in the whole Amsterdam! They serve tasty and juicy burgers made from the best ingredients. ‚Ä¶
37,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I love their sweet potato fries with truffle mayo!! They have a great variety of burgers including portobello burgers!! Last but not least they also serve milkshakes!!
38,The Butcher, 2 stars ,a year ago,Over 30 Euros for burned sweet potatoes fries and a cheeseburger with invisible cheese. Both me and my partner tried our best to find the cheese but it was nowhere to be found. Second time of disappointment at this place.
39,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The burgers are great but it‚Äôs a tiny space and the service is hit and miss - but I still go back for a burger if there is room
40,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic burgers, well worth visit- especially if you like burgers. Excellent service, not much seating available, take away availability."
41,The Butcher, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"We booked the ""Secret"" kitchen, for 2.
The evening starting well, with good (but expensive : 12-15‚Ç¨) cocktails ! ‚Ä¶"
42,The Butcher, 5 stars ,a year ago,"one of the best burgers you can have in Amsterdam! the staff are very friendly. there aren't many tables, but it is worth the wait, or you can have it for take away. great prices and great quality. will definitely visit again."
43,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious meat in these burgers, real butcher quality üëå"
44,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, fast and delicious manu , awesome quality burger for the price , if you like burger's it's a must in Amsterdam."
45,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tasty burgers, a bit overpriced.  Small seating area, but fun butcher theme."
46,The Butcher, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Ordered the cheese burger with fries and BBQ sauce. Took around 15 minutes to make but at least you could see it being made and could therefore taste the freshness. Burger was well cooked and fries were very tasty with the BBQ dip. Not badly prices either, a good little find. Will return when i'm next in Dam."
47,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Tasty burger and a must try sweet potato fries
48,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty flame grilled juicy burger with great flavour
49,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great hamburger, really good sweet potato fries. The place is really fun to sit at, too."
50,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing burgers, helpful staff,  good prices"
51,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great food! & It‚Äôs cooked fresh right in front of you
52,The Butcher, 4 stars ,a year ago,"My favourite place for burgers in Amsterdam. Go for the Daddy and you won't regret it. Juicy and very tasty, you can fell the taste of high quality ingredients."
53,The Butcher, 1 star ,a year ago,"WARNING! The 'secret' kitchen of The Butcher is a scam! Overpriced, manipulative and without ambiance. The menu is mediocre to begin with, but you aren't even served all of the items that are mentioned with the dishes nor are they prepared ‚Ä¶"
54,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool concept. The bar is great, and having burgers and fries at 2:45 is incredible"
55,The Butcher, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Worst burger I've ever tasted. I gave it a 2 because the sweet potato fries(chips) were amazing!
56,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is a hidden gem, there aren't many seats so be prepared to wait or order the food for take away... They have so many burgers to choose from on the menu and a good deal of sides. I went with a fizzy drink over beer however there ‚Ä¶"
57,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down, one of the best burgers! Sweet potato fries were amazing!"
58,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best location for burger in Amsterdam! You have to try it...
59,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great juicy beef patty brown on the outside and pink on the inside. Too bad the buns are cold when they were served
60,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The burger and fries were fresh and delicious!!
61,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Perfect!! Highly recommend.
62,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Delicious burger, genuine place."
63,The Butcher, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This place has everything to have an amazing burger. The meat is definitely the best part, the flame grilled burger is very tasty. Find it so disappointing that both times I went the bun was served cold. French fries aren't fresh, how can ‚Ä¶"
64,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice burger. Cooked fresh over a grill when you order which is nice, and very nice fries. ‚Ä¶"
65,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great burger, awesome place!"
66,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great burger s and fries.
67,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing burger!  Cooked to my specificationss ! Fresh Angus beef,  one piece of edam cheese on bottom of Patty one piece of american on top,  a fried egg,  lettuce,  tomato,  grilled onions just a few,  butcher sauce.  One of my best ‚Ä¶"
68,The Butcher, 3 stars ,a year ago,Overrated and overpriced burgers. Don't understand all the hype about this chain. People who say thay these burgers are good have never tried good burgers and probably have no taste. The best burgers are made by Black Star Burger in Russia.
69,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of the best burgers I have ever tried
70,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Hell yeah for the sweet potato fries!!!! with truffle mayonese ofcours. Also best vegetarian burger I ever had
71,The Butcher, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Awesome burgers, first tried in the Foodhallen but enjoyed a late night post bar eat here, watching the high heeled crew entering the bar in the back whilst shoving a burger in my face out front. 5 star based on burgers in Amsterdam."
72,The Butcher, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Yes, best burger of the city. But tonight they forgot 1 sweet potato fries and 1 add-on, so 7‚Ç¨ on the order. We didn't checked the order because we trust the place, but it shouldn't happen"
73,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best burgers we‚Äôve ever tasted.
74,The Butcher, 3 stars ,11 months ago,"Great burger place, but didn‚Äôt pay attention to our delivery at all-added the ingredients that we asked to leave out and delivered the wrong sauce!"
75,The Butcher, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Decent burger, but nothing spectacular. I had the Butcher burger and regular fries. The patty was juicy and well cooked, but the bun wasn‚Äôt great and the burger felt too small. Especially compared to the copious amount of fries they gave me. For 14eu it was okay, but I wouldn‚Äôt go out of my way to come back."
76,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was ok. Not the best burger that we had and not the worse. I ordered extra cheese on my burger and sadly there was no cheese and my patty was really small, the one of my hubby was the doubble. The fries where a 4 out of 10. The service ‚Ä¶"
77,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good but not great. Lots of good burger combos to choose from and one of the few places in town with all you can eat catchup and mayo at no additional charge. My primary beef (pun intended) with the Butcher is that there is too much bread on their bun. The beef to bun ratio is off.
78,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I went there for a burger which was great. I was happy to see they had milkshakes on the menu. However, they were too busy to make them which was OK, the cook and cashier said he could make one later. When later came around he could not locate a take away cup or even the means with which to make the milkshake"
79,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wow. Simple place, counter service - extraordinary cooked to order burger. Very high quality meat, mine was cooked medium rare to perfection. Fresh quality 'fixings'. I am a bit of a connoisseur of burgers, have sampled them all over the world, extensively in the USA, this would rate as among the best of the best."
80,The Butcher, 1 star ,2 years ago,Not good. Toilet had a broken tap and no soap. It'd clearly been that way for some time. The staff said we could wash our hands in the food prep area. No thanks guys. I'd rather eat somewhere that fixes their plumbing. Shame as I was really exited to try the burgers. I'll try another one of their locations
81,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best burgers that I have had in my life. And I know a thing or two about beef! ;). Seating is a bit limited but hey, the burgers just make up for it. Friendly service!"
82,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,For me this is one of the best burger joints in town. Burger are well prepared in charcoal to perfection. Juicy and tender. It is a very small place so it tends to be crowded very easy. But you are not there for that right. Other ‚Ä¶
83,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great tasting burgers, completely worth it! Was recommended this place by 2 locals (separately) so wanted to give it a try. Quite a pretentious bar however at the back (that‚Äôs quite small) but it had some good cocktails."
84,The Butcher, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"This place is a quick sit down for burgers. I've been here a couple of times. In the past it was one of the best burgers in town. However they are changing staff very often, ending up with not stable quality. The burgers are good, but cooking expertise varies."
85,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing burgers, great fries, and I plan on visiting again to try the popcorn chicken and sweet fries.  It's right next to a street market, so you can shop and get some great food when you're done with that.  It was empty when we visited at lunch but it was probably because the weather was so nice out."
86,The Butcher, 1 star ,5 years ago,"23 minutes to get a take away burger! that was over cooked and overpriced.

They might serve a decent burger sometimes but my last few visits have made me ‚Ä¶"
87,The Butcher, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The first time I ate here was great, we were the only guests and the Brazilian guy making the burgers was very nice and was an artist with his cooking, the burgers looked and tasted great! ‚Ä¶"
88,The Butcher, 1 star ,4 years ago,"My partner and I had lunch here today. We had to wait a long time to be served, and a party of 4 who ordered after us were served before us.  When I started eating my hamburger, I noticed that it was rather pink. As I continued to eat, ‚Ä¶"
89,The Butcher, 1 star ,2 years ago,"One of tourist hyped places, where you can neither find good taste nor good service. It is ironic that it is called as the best burger place in Amsterdam by people visiting Amsterdam for a few days/weeks. If you want to eat a mediocre ‚Ä¶"
90,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The Butcher has premium burgers for a reasonable price. They have a great variety of styles to choose from, all flame grilled in eyesight. No comfortable seats and quite chilly, so it's not a place to stay for too long."
91,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The finest burgers i have ever come across. Juicy to the core. Fast food joint serving gourmet burgers. The price is almost as any other fastfood joint, quality and taste is unbelievable!"
92,The Butcher, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Ordered a fish burger and only got a piece of fish without Sauce. We had to ask for the Sauce . The burgers were too small for the price.and the bun was so dry i needed to Drink something. If you want a good burger id recommend burger bar.
93,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Vegan option! It was delicious and I will definitely come back when I visit Amsterdam again in the future
94,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Hamburguers delicious!! If you get a better service increase this preference
95,The Butcher, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"A strange, bizarre night, the trip to the Butcher began with an email to the man himself. After signing a secret agreement and sending back the form, we headed to the location. Passing through the normal fast food style front (which has ‚Ä¶"
96,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good food for an okayish price!
97,The Butcher, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Shop interior smelled ""funny"". So my expectations were low. The burger took a while to be prepared but then the first bite into a beef pattie grilled to perfection sent me into a momentary trance. The pattie practically exploded in my mouth releasing an amazing taste. I've never had such a delicious beef burger. Awesome!"
98,The Butcher, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Exclusive .. not talking about the burgers but if u know about the extra bit in the back just know that it‚Äôs extremely hard to get in. They have to know you or someone they know has to have put you on the list. And it‚Äôs extremely packed... overly packed.. I think door74 has a much better atmosphere but it‚Äôs nice to check out, if u can."
99,The Butcher, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"A burger bar with some pretty decent burgers, although definitely not the best in town.
The interesting part of this venue: The hidden bar behind the kitchen, ‚Ä¶"
100,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,not too bad but nothing special. Average burger. Our patties were dry even we asked for not to be cooked well done.
101,The Butcher, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Decent burgers for a fair price.. just hard to find a place to sit. Plus if you watch the cooks they don't change gloves  after handling ‚Ç¨ or non food objects. Then handle food. They also use the same tongs and spatula on every food item.. raw chicken / seafood / beef.
102,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Zo Lekker! The Butcher is one of the best burger places in town! We are always looking for a juicy, well seasoned, well topped burger and this place surpasses our expectations. We've tried several of their burgers and thoroughly enjoyed ‚Ä¶"
103,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good burgers wiht tasty beef
104,The Butcher, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Not entirely sure what the fuss is all about? There are better burger joints in my opinion with much larger portals of better quality. Difficult to get a table at times as well. ‚Ä¶
105,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,If you came to Amsterdam looking for a good American burger. This is the only place to go. Great burgers!  It's amazing to finally get a burger cooked nice and pink inside.
106,The Butcher, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I order via Deliveroo, and as I‚Äôm pregnant and asked for my burger to be ‚Äòwell done‚Äô. My request was completely ignored and totally raw on the inside. Had to bake it myself for another 10 min, till the lukewarm fries were completely cold. ‚Ä¶"
107,The Butcher, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best burgers in town. If you are in a rush dont be disappointed - good food needs time to be prepared.
108,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious grilled burgers. Nice fries. The place is a little bit small. There is a hidden cocktail bar on the back, too. Need the password to have them open the door for you"
109,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Place looks noice, burger is foine. Service is below averege."
110,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is soooooo good. I believe there are a few of these restaurants in/around Amsterdam. Simple menu packed full of flavour, delivered by friendly staff with a bit of banter. Highly recommended and I'll be going back when I'm next in the Netherlands."
111,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Omg yum! Best burger ever!
112,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"All that hype around the secret club.... and it was not that much of an experience. I think for those not spoiled by the exclusive environments and locations of London, NY Moscow etc. it still will be a nice experience. But for the rest - ‚Ä¶"
113,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Located in the heart of the Albert Cuypmarkt, the butcher offers a variety of meat based dishes. Their burgers are prepared at the order, in front of the customer. The meat is delicious. A good place to stop if you feel like having a burger."
114,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good meat, a great hamburger.
The guy that had received our order, was a bit antipathetic.
If you like hamburgers, this is a place you must try.
It is located inside the Albert Cuyp Market"
115,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Not the best The Butcher but still very very good. Only thing I would change is the insanely loud EDM blasting inside. We all don‚Äôt love EDM - kinda made me feel anxious and rushed to eat fast and get out. Although the food is great and reasonably priced. Girl with the dark hair and glasses that works there is really sweet.
116,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good burgers for 10EU. Nice staff
117,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Loved The Butcher with Cheese Burger! Juicy and full of flavour. Got The Daddy Burger after to be adventurous and was dissapointed so I recommend to keep it simple.
118,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Went looking for a late night food spot while visiting Amsterdam and was NOT disappointed! Great big juicy burger with enough topping to keep you surprised! Will definitely be coming back next time I am in town.
119,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Well executed burger and very good. Fries are not homemade :(
The welcome is so cold, not a warming environment. Unfriendly."
120,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Speakeasy. Made us order a set 3 corse menu for 55 ‚Ç¨ + cocktails. Great service. Made us come way too early on Saturday night. Nothing starts before 10:30 pm
Good DJ... Wish we didn't get bored and left after 2 hrs being only guests in ‚Ä¶"
121,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very tasty burger with no messing around
122,The Butcher, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"People rave about this place but honestly its nothing to write home about.

It certainly isn't as good as a burger you would get pretty much anywhere in ‚Ä¶"
123,The Butcher, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Ordered and paid for extra cheese only to discover at home that there was none, instead so much sauce that I couldn't taste anything else. Had I not been starving, the burger would have ended up in the bin. I never complain, but this was an (overpriced) excuse of a burger."
124,The Butcher, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Decent burgers. Staff fine. Nothing to blow your mind but pretty solid. Bit pokey for sitting down. ‚Ä¶
125,The Butcher, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We got dinner in the Butchers secret kitchen. Warning: reservations for this secret kitchen and hidden speak easy bar are only to be made via website.
We tried to get in earlier with no reservation but no luck ended up having ‚Ä¶"
126,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a good burger. But nothing to get too excited about - I went here because of previous reviews, and had a bit too high expectations."
127,The Butcher, 1 star ,3 years ago,"10 points for the idea, 0 points for execution.  Dining here was a mi-steak. The 2 girls at the table did their absolute best, but the food was bad. All courses were extreme salty and the main course portions are tiny. Two orders were wrong ‚Ä¶"
128,The Butcher, 1 star ,4 years ago,"They did an amazing PR strategy to be the 'top' burgers in Amsterdam because they are waaaay far to be even top 20... The only thing I take from this restaurant are the fries and nothing else... The burgers are very very bad, no taste, bad bun, bad meat and BAD but very BAAAD SERVICE! Will never recommend them to anyone..."
129,The Butcher, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"If you're looking for a good burger, this is the place. Nothing too fancy (although there is some secret place in the back behind 'members only'). The Daddy burger was very tasty. Not a restaurant for a night out."
130,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great burgers and shakes.
131,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My go-to place when I need a soul satisfying body destroying meal. The best combo to go with if you are high - The butcher with cheese, sweet fries and the milkshake. ‚Ä¶"
132,The Butcher, 4 stars ,a year ago,The burger is really tasty and fresh. The location is a lil but small and not that cozy.
133,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It wasn't the best burger I've had, but it was feckin good. 10er for a double cheese burger is a bit steep, but quality nonetheless."
134,The Butcher, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Their burgers are kind of great for Amsterdam, and less expensive than their greatest competitor, the Burgermeester. However, this place has gotten so slow. They promise ten minutes, but it's always half an hour. Orders are sometimes slightly off, and the ooomphfff is just out of the place."
135,The Butcher, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice buns, but the patties themselves are dry and tasteless. They try to cover that with the sauce and other ingredients, but it doesn't work. Fries like standard oven chips."
136,The Butcher, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The staff seems to be treating guests as if it was down town (annoyed by the tourists). The toilets are well hidden and unmarked. When I was looking for the toilets I was stopped as if I was a thief. No hand soap in the toilets. The food is just not that great. You are probably better off at the burger bar, just around the corner."
137,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good burger, but we waited an hour for it. I would recommend ordering online since they give priority to such orders over the ones made in person."
138,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Amazing burgers! The high quality meat is perfectly cooked every time. Prices are average for a burger place. Strongly suggested!
139,The Butcher, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Hipster type burger joint hidden behind the open air market. Quick service. A straight laced burger to fulfill those lunchtime cravings. Not extraordinary, but a decent feed."
140,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really great burgers!
141,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Not the best burger in Amsterdam. I find it average. Burgermeester is much more delicious! You can try both though. It really depends on your taste.
142,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great burger, full of flavour."
143,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was good! Cooked right. I will say that there was only 2 staff on, so the food took longer than expected, but they seemed quite overworked and it was unfortunate to see them stressed. Another employee would have helped."
144,The Butcher, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This place is OVERRATED! The only cool part was walking through the secret door to the bar. The bar was just a normal bar, no character and nothing spectacular or special at all about this place. I will never go here again. I had a small ‚Ä¶"
145,The Butcher, 3 stars ,8 years ago,They have a secret room in the back you can book for fancy events. Otherwise this place is overrated. The burgers were nothing to write home about and pricey (around $10 USD each). Meat almost always overcooked and staff not very efficient.
146,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good burger witb tasty meat for 12 euros
147,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good burgers in front. Better food, great drinks & atmosphere in secret kitchen. Dark, quiet bar, w incredibly friendly barkeeps. Make reservations, get passwords & go immediately."
148,The Butcher, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"I visited a handfull of times now to try different burgers but im less inclined to visit again. Staff seems almost bothered to help customers as if better things to do like having fun. The burger is okay but not wow, so a bit overpriced for the experience."
149,The Butcher, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Ordered my burger at 1:10pm, it's now 1:40 and I still have no burger.  I've talked to the staff and they say ""it's coming, minimum of 15 minutes.""  So it should've been done twice now?"
150,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Butcher makes my favorite burgers in Amsterdam, however this one is a little small with almost no places to sit. If you can i would recommend going to the Butcher Nine street as it offers more places to sit."
151,The Butcher, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I have eaten in this place last week..... and damn it was bad...... the guy at the couter was stressed out, they lost our order asked us like 4 times what we wanted to eat again. then they still made me a wrong burger. mij friend and I got ‚Ä¶"
152,The Butcher, 1 star ,9 months ago,A load of rubbish. Half the order was missing when it arrived. Overcooked meat. Undercooked fries. Should have gone to Golden Arches.
153,The Butcher, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Solid burger place. Friendly staff and good music. A nice place to go if you're at the Albert Cuyp market and want to duck in for a filling burger, but do expect prices higher than you might  anticipate."
154,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I like it, there's veggie burger option, but I would prefer that they wouldn't handle meat at all... Still cool place about their secret club"
155,The Butcher, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"1. BEST BURGER OF MY LIFE!
2. the secret bar in the back is a very cool concept. you only get in by invite with a password. but, its very very small. we were not in the mood. otherwise would have been super fun."
156,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic place for a quick bite while you roam around the market. A must go. Very near the Heineken museum. Try the hamburger with the butcher sauce, it's freaking delicious."
157,The Butcher, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Recently the quality has really gone down.  In addition to burned burger patties, the last time I ate here I found 3 metal staples in my hamburger meat.  With so many burger options in Amsterdam, I will choose another place to eat."
158,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best burgers I've had. A must visit if you like a tasty burger
159,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great burger I‚Äôve been here second time now , I don‚Äôt like bloody burger but here I order it medium üòé"
160,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"They forgot to ask me how much to cook the burger and made it well done. Also the cook was pushing on the meat while grilling, which kind of dried out the otherwise great Aberdeen beef"
161,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great burger, one of the best in town. Deserves a 5 but place is to small and gets  really crowded sometimes."
162,The Butcher, 1 star ,a year ago,"Horrible waiting time to receive food which is supposed to be ""fast food"". Very unprofessional restaurant. Not recommended, spend your hard earned money somewhere else."
163,The Butcher, 4 stars ,6 years ago,The burgers are good but on a busy day you can end up waiting for a while. The interior is set up for quick bites rather than social eating.
164,The Butcher, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great service, great food! Seating is a bit cramped."
165,The Butcher, 1 star ,4 years ago,Arrived 8pm on a Saturday and it was busy but not crazy. They asked if we could wait 10-15 minutes to order since the grill was full which makes sense. The guy working the register said we would be first in the queue when they were ready. ‚Ä¶
166,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious! Come here for a great burger and sweet potato fries. Our fave burgers in Amsterdam. Right in the heart of the Albert Cuyp Market.
167,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Exquisite burgers in Amsterdam. It is a small place, a bit hidden by a market but when you'll have a bit in the burgers you'll be happy to come here. The fries are good as well."
168,The Butcher, 1 star ,5 years ago,If only there was a '0' star option. All style over substance and the style is so brutalisitc that you couldn't really say there is any sense of hospitality. ‚Ä¶
169,The Butcher, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The burger is pretty standard, almost below average. There was nothing extraordinary or memorable. On top of that, they screwed up the orders"
170,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A little patience is required here but the burgers are mouth-wateringly delicious and worth the wait. The service was friendly and the atmosphere is cool but it‚Äôs a tight space when it‚Äôs crowded.
171,The Butcher, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Small, noisy, full of loud Italians who kept on screaming out loud. The burgers were not bad, not great; just ok.
I could pay in cash, but the cashier couldn't return me ANY money, no matter how much I have him. I haven't seen that before."
172,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Best burgers in the city. The place is quite small and it might be difficult to find a spot at certain hours, but it is really worth it if you like good meat."
173,The Butcher, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Had a burger & fries delivered and mentioned the burger should be very well done; the request was not taken into consideration, so I had to throw it away and have the fries only."
174,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best burger of the World.
175,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately, the burger was somehow cold. As fresh as the ingredients seemed this prevented us from enjoying the burger as much as we were hoping for."
176,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great burger and shake. They were very kind to accommodate our restrictions in removing some ingredients and paying cash.
177,The Butcher, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Disappointing this time, ugly burger had tomato on it?
Took this one because it's without tomato, avocado was missing, they forgot to give me fries and the staff was talking all the time about how busy it was and they didn't have enough people working there, and that it was badly organised etc."
178,The Butcher, 2 stars ,5 years ago,The place is hot and stuffy. The burgers were very average and items that we ordered were missing. All of that while we were the only people in the restaurant. Not recommended.
179,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best burger in Amsterdam hands down
180,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good burgers. Great fries. Nice place with a big selection of burgers. A little expansive
181,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Hard to top this one, I always go for the butcher burger. Extremely juicy patties cooked with passion and attention! They use only brioche buns."
182,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is small, but not difficult to find. The burger is just great, the meat was incredible! I strongly recommend."
183,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"True to their name, the meat was of the best quality. Really enjoyed my burger here. Quite possibly the best burger place in Amsterdam."
184,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ok, this is just about the best burger you can have anywhere in the world. Simply amazing. No alcohol served so that is a bummer."
185,The Butcher, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was good. But the cash machine wasn't working so I had to go to an ATM to withdraw money. The personnel was kind but quite confusing. Also, during the summer it is really hot inside."
186,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"small place with good service and great food,
have some interesting dishes, but we stuck to the burger - excellent
fries - are wonderful"
187,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very delicious burgers but a bit small. The guy that welcomed us deserves 5 star, the rest not"
188,The Butcher, 1 star ,3 years ago,"3 tables only, on top a crowd coming from a backside room (maybe an escort service or something like that) guys in ties and hookers, make their way in and out. You are on a corridor of this pretentious exclusive horror squeezed around. The high points on Google given to this place are something I can't get my head around."
189,The Butcher, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"It was a bit hard to find in the open air market, but well worth the hunt.  The fries were awesome, the truffle burger even better.  I'll be back."
190,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I don't norm ally eat burgers but this place is a must if you love burgers, they do fantastic sweet potatoe fries too."
191,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good burgers but barely any space to eat them at the place. Better to go for the ""secret party"" than to eat at the place."
192,The Butcher, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Burger was okay, well cooked and had good texture but was lacking seasoning. Venue was a bit grubby and unclean looking."
193,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great burger fries and sauces. Would love to come back again if in the area. Worth the relatively long wait
194,The Butcher, 1 star ,2 years ago,Ordered food. Only delivered half of my order. Called twice and no one could find my order even though they just sent it so wouldn‚Äôt send the remainder of my order. ‚Ä¶
195,The Butcher, 1 star ,2 years ago,Today poisioned with less bun burger!! Second time visit and first time this happens to me here. Too much pain and throwing out. I don't recommend
196,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good but a little pricey. It's a bit of a chain here. The burger was very good though, ignoring price."
197,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good authentic burgers, good quick service, not much seating space but does the job"
198,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you‚Äôre from the US and love five guys, this burger is almost an exact replica!!!!!! The workers here were so friendly we wish we could come back!!"
199,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"MUST TRY! (that's ALL I have to say, the rest leave it to you guys whenever you are there)"
200,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great hamburgers and sweet potatos! Great
service as well. the shakes aren't amazing but it didn't bother to the experience."
201,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great burgers and service! Very, very good! But there are much more clients than this place can handle."
202,The Butcher, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible employees looking desperate to have to serve you. If you don't want to work don't work. We are just here to eat not our fault if you don't like your job. Side note food is good.
203,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really cool atmosphere, they make the burger right in front of you. Very good and unique options"
204,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The Burgers are crazy good not much for the veggies but if your a meet lover your in the right place.  And if you know the password then you know what I'm talking about ;)
205,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Small place and very basic, but the food is great. Simple choice of burgers and fries mainly but the quality is superb and the best I'vehad in a long time"
206,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The yummiest Hamburgers you can find in town!
207,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great hidden secret restaurant!

When you least expect to find anything different than a nice fast food type of ‚Ä¶"
208,The Butcher, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wow!!!!! I just had the daddy burger, one of the best burger I have ever eaten, wow üëè"
209,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious burger. Fair price. The meat was juicy i really enjoyed it
210,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Insanely good burgers, cooked to perfection by an incredibly international crew. Their fries and burgers are an amazing combo."
211,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The Butcher hamburger was excellent! You SHOULD try the sweet potato fries as well. So delicious!
212,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great and original burgers
213,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved the burger and those were one of the best fries i've ever tried!

215,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious burgers with great service! Will definitely go back to try other burgers!
216,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice staff and food. I ordered the Daddy and it was superlicious with sweet potato fries and their special sauce ‚Ä¶
217,The Butcher, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Great burgers but the ‚Äòsecret restaurant‚Äô in the back is 200% not worth the money.
218,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great burgers, cool atmosphere. More of a takeaway than eat in place though, there are only a few tables."
219,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Never mind the burger bar - sneak through the back door late at night to find a hidden cocktail speakeasy. A very cool bar with every cocktail you could ever imagine.
220,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Maybe the crowded place to eat is not for everyone but the burgers are great! Great means nothing comparable anywhere nearby.
221,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty burgers restaurant quality, but more like a fast food place, not a real restaurant"
222,The Butcher, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Small place, not really a good burger, I went to better place in Amsterdam.
Little bit expensive for what it is. I'm kind of disappointed."
223,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty and cool staff. Meat is very fresh and tasty grilled plus the fries are nice, fresh and crunchy!"
224,The Butcher, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Great burger, but staff was not friendly. Go to burgermeester, much more friendly staff with great burgers and much cleaner restaurant."
225,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super delicious burgers. Friendly staff and great mood.
226,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice burgers. We went there 2 days in the row it was so tasty.
227,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A little space for a big and great burger
228,The Butcher, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Too long to wait, boring atmosphere, boring staff, poor burgers - pates are too thick and overlooked, poor balance of fat to meat in overly bready brioche."
229,The Butcher, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Burger was good, fries were good and plenty. A little pricy, and the music was way too loud."
230,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing burgers, and if you manage to go to the club.. the best cocktails in town!"
231,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Didn't try the Butcher itself, but the secret cocktail bar at the back is awesome. You need a password to get in. In the same spirit as New York's PDT."
232,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Burger place. Small, not cheap, but worth it. Who can find the toilet without asking?"
233,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome place with a little tiny secret at the back! Best burgers in town!
234,The Butcher, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, the guys working there are very hospitable and funny. Good burgers."
235,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Average burger - not as good as it seems when you read the reviews. So don‚Äôt expect too much then it will be fine.
236,The Butcher, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice place for a quick bite or take away. Barely any places to seat but the generosity of the burgers makes up for that.
237,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Probably the best burgers ever! Go for the truffle burger, a must. The place is awesome"
238,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Awesome place. Best burger i have ever tasted. Freshest vegetables i have ever seen.
239,The Butcher, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The burger tastes as if it was frozen, and not fresh. Other than that it was a good burger."
240,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice burgers! The butcher's wife's favorite is mine as well. Please don't tell him.
241,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very decent burger overall. Nice bun.

243,The Butcher, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great burgers in a casual place. You will leave smelling of charred burgers!
244,The Butcher, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Fantastic quality meat, with an impressive burger-to-bun ratio. However, the chips could be improved."
245,The Butcher, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Worth the walk from central Amsterdam, amazing burger full of taste and flavor. Definitely recommend trying it!!"
246,The Butcher, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice burgers. If mine was 'well-done', 'rare' probably moos."

249,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Small place but the burgers are really good. Would always come back.
250,The Butcher, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have eaten a lot of burgers, but this is probably the best burger i have eaten!"
251,The Butcher, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Make sure you specify how you want your burger done. But the sweet potato fries üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
252,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great burguers and with a vegetarian option. There are also fish burguers. The space is quite small but it's worth a visita.

272,The Butcher, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The hamburguer is good but really far from being the best. The place is too small and crowded.
273,The Butcher, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great authentic burgers, walking distance to the Heineken Experience and the Van Gogh museum!"
274,The Butcher, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The burgers were good but the chicken was dry and too salty. The chips was also oversalted
