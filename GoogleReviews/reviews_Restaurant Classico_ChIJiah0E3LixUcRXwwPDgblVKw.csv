7,Restaurant Classico, 1 star ,2 years ago,Cute restaurant but whomever has rated this before has clearly never had Italian food. Had to wait over an hour for food - there were only 6 people in the entire restaurant. Food lacked flavour and seasoning. Pasta sauce out of a jar had better flavour.

39,Restaurant Classico, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"To me this restaurant lacked authenticity, it was kind of 'Italian style' but not an Italian restaurant. It was not a bad experience either, rather correct especially with a 50% discount from theFork but I would not come here again and would be really disappointed to pay the full price for eating at Classico."
40,Restaurant Classico, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place with great service. In true Italian fashion, they take care of you and try to get you the best experience possible. In summer sitting on the street makes everything even more special.
Go there!!!"
41,Restaurant Classico, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Not the real Itailian  experience. We could not order any beefdish  because they run out after a group of 6 ordered the last beef they had in stock. Why serve Heineken from a can and not real Italian beer.

44,Restaurant Classico, 3 stars ,3 months ago,Very cold inside and overpriced food
45,Restaurant Classico, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Carpaccio is not as you are used to - it's basically just fancy baloney and not raw meat. We asked to take a different dish instead and they refused. Rest of the food was average at best other than the caprese which was very good.
46,Restaurant Classico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When good meets great. Try the fettuccine with funghi. It is finished at your table in the cheese.
