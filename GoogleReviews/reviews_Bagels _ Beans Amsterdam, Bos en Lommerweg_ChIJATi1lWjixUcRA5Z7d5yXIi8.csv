4,"Bagels & Beans Amsterdam, Bos en Lommerweg", 1 star ,4 months ago,"It’d be much healthier if people working there wears gloves. They work with bare hands and touch their face then the pin machine and then to the lid of the coffee cup or to the bagels. Seen it today, not going there again."

Great way to start a day."

8,"Bagels & Beans Amsterdam, Bos en Lommerweg", 1 star ,5 months ago,"Pretty slow, not clean, in the sense, I will never forget one woman at the bar, preparing a smoothie ( not mine ) and sneezing in the air at the same time, without mask, during a pandemic. You can't judge by one episode. But still."

34,"Bagels & Beans Amsterdam, Bos en Lommerweg", 1 star ,5 years ago,"I like the Bagels & Beans franchise, however this one in Bos en Lommer is by far the most dirty one I have been to. Sticky and not so clean tables and dirty floor. Staff seems not trained well, slow service. Staff smokes in front of the main entrance. However the staff is nice. Suggestion, try another Bagel & Beans restaurant."
