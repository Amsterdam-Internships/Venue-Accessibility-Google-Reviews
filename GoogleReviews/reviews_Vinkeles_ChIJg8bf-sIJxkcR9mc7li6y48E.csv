0,Vinkeles, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Impeccable service. Romantic venue in a top Amsterdam location. The food was excellent, but ""wow"" effect only a couple of dishes. It's more towards a 2stars price, with 1star only, but justified by the location. Only 4/5 because I really didn't enjoy the celeriac dish - yuzu miso, coffee and truffle is just too much an hazard imo."

8,Vinkeles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I enjoyed my evening here with my family. The service is wonderful, the food is of good quality, though to me some seem to be mediocre, but that can be overlooked if you consider the atmosphere of the restaurant. To me, this is the THING ‚Ä¶"
9,Vinkeles, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Very overpriced: one star dining at two star prices. Quality was not exceptional enough to justify the price nor the exaggeratedly small portions. Pigeon dish was unique, venue was pleasant but overall an underwhelming experience."
