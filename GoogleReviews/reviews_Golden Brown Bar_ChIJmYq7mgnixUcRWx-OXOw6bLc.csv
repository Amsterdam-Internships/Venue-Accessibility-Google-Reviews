0,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really nice vib. I arrived late during the new Covid lock down so wasn't sure if I could be accommodated.  Sat upstairs and was well looked after by a really nice staff mamber even though my colleagues couldn't make it in time. Will definitely visit again.
1,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"We came here all the way from Chicago, IL, USA!! They threw down on the vegan pad Thai and the massaman was üòòüëå authentic and comforting on a cool chilly night. Very nice staff and service üòå Well worth the trip!"

16,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious food (I always get Pad Thai) and lovely hosts with original Thai cooks. An super extra plus is the coffee, it's hard to find a good coffee in a restaurant these days."
17,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Would not expect this place to serve delicious Thai food based on its exterior, but my word is it good.  Great selection of dishes with a nice cocktail menu as well.  Some of the dishes pack a nice punch, too - always a rarity in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"

23,Golden Brown Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for a late afternoon wheat beer outside in the sun. Excellent Thai food but as it got colder later on in the evening we wanted to move inside but they weren't keen on letting us, even though there were empty tables upstairs. Spoiled the end a little."
24,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this place for both lunch and dinner. Good thai for a very reasonable price. Unpretentious and friendly service and staff, even when it is very busy. I live in the neighborhood and come here for just a drink or a dinner often. Keep up the good work. Hard to find such a place in Amsterdam :)!"
25,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great place, very friendly people and hands down awesome food, big portions!"
26,Golden Brown Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Great food but we were refused tap water with our meals. Bizarre considering we spent a lot on food, but we didn‚Äôt order any drinks. Have never experienced this at a restaurant before, very strange."
27,Golden Brown Bar, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered chicken satay and it came fried, not grilled. Not authentic at all. And the peanut sauce was too salty. The waitress was initially friendly but when we declined to order drinks with our food, she immediately turned cold and frosty. ‚Ä¶"
28,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great atmosphere with friendly and efficient staff. We saw the Thai food on offer on our first visit and decided to return to eat and we were not disappointed. No hesitation in recommending this bar.

30,Golden Brown Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is tasteful Thai+. The same you can score at a take away, but presented om a nice platter in a nice atmosphere. Just be prepared to wait for a loooooong time i.e. approximately 1.5 hours. Happened to me three times already.  But staff is nice and friendly and food nice."

35,Golden Brown Bar, 2 stars ,6 years ago,A lot has changed since I last came here. The service has gotten worse. With only 4 people in the place they still managed to forget the food I ordered. It was until I saw those after get their full dish (I got a snack) I had to walk to the ‚Ä¶

37,Golden Brown Bar, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"This is a cozy, lovely  restaurant with  nice atmosphere inside.

It was reasonably priced.
All with all: great value for money!"
38,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this place! Amsterdam is a warm, friendly city and this neighbourhood Thai restaurant fits the bill. Food was extremely fresh, staff was very helpful and we didn't have to wait long to find a table."
39,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love this place! Nice staff, lekker tha√Ø food, delicious cocktails, reasonable prices. We always come back!"
40,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"No complaints about the service. Food was DELICIOUS. The chicken satay was extremely well flavoured with a nice crunch, and the curry with rice had great flavours. Coffee also came with a stroopwaffle. Solid restaurant."
41,Golden Brown Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Do not order mixed drinks. A total rip off. My mojito had do much ice, I took 3 sips and it was done. The bartender proceeded to argue with us that that's how mojitos are done and that we were wrong. I had my share of mixed drinks ‚Ä¶"
42,Golden Brown Bar, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"I have been going here for about a year and never had any complaints , the food is good and the people are nice , but I went there the other night with my sister who was visiting me from the UK and towards the end of the meal she found a ‚Ä¶"
43,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Everything was incredibly tasty from the food to the cocktails. Have the Lap Kai and papaya salad. Get the Bobby's Blend, with a splash of ginger ale. I'm not usually one for Thai, as it's hard to manage my peanut allergy, but these people are absolute pros!"
44,Golden Brown Bar, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Foods lovely, but charging 12-15 Euro (depending on protein choice) + rice on top ~2.5 Euro is pretty stiff."
45,Golden Brown Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,The food was good. Service was terrible! The waitress completely ignored my wife and was rude to us the entire time. She stared at me to the point of making me feel uncomfortable and blocking the space between my partner and I. The staff could use lots of improvement.
46,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best Thai food I have tried in Amsterdam. And I have tried a lot. Fresh ingredients. Each dish has their dedicated taste. Great service.
47,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"After a hectic weekend in Amsterdam, we stumbled upon this bar late on Sunday evening.
Not only were the Barmen cheerful and welcoming The Thai food that is served here is the most authentic We have tasted outside of Thailand!"
48,Golden Brown Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Thai food was decent but -1 star for the food not being entirely authentic (ordered massaman and there were no potatoes in it) and -1 star for horribly long waiting times (we waited for an hour for our food to arrive).
49,Golden Brown Bar, 3 stars ,a year ago,Food is good but service is too long. We waited 1h30 hour before being served even having made a prior reservation online
50,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great thai food place in a bar like setup. Fun ambience. Nice place to hangout with friends and enjoy some food. They've outdoor seating too.
51,Golden Brown Bar, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice area. Didn't stay that long or try the food, but enjoyed sitting on the benches in the street sipping a beer. Good service, the friendly barwoman gave me some information about getting the tram."
52,Golden Brown Bar, 1 star ,8 years ago,"The food was fine but the service was terrible. The waiter who served us brought us our dishes without making eye contact, he was openly unfriendly and behaved in an arrogant way when we tried to express politely that we were not feeling comfortable. He made us feel like we shouldn't be there... A very unpleasant experience!"
53,Golden Brown Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Sandwiches didn‚Äôt look great but tasted very good - red curry and pad Thai were probably the winners I would probably advise to stick to Thai menu
54,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My soy latte was delicious and I like fact that the tealight was kept lit. A bit loud in the evening. Very nice interior.
55,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very cool place with good vibes. Amazing Thai food and not expensive at all. The staff were very friendly. It's a place to come back..!

59,Golden Brown Bar, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Visit the Golden Brown if you're looking for a nice, relaxed atmosphere where you can have a drink and talk to your friends. It's. It never too crowded and if you get in early, grab a bite to eat! At the same time, it's nothing special, just s place you can eat and drink."
60,Golden Brown Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Unfortunately had a poor experience. Walked in on New Year's Eve and the bar lady was rude and unwelcoming, short with us when taking our order. It was a disappointing experience after having received recommendations from friends."
61,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,6 years ago,One of the most authentic thai food that I can find in Europe. The thai green curry is a must try if you miss the savoury taste.
62,Golden Brown Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty Thai food in a nice setting. You wouldn't think they serve Thai food given the exterior/interior, but a quality joint all around"

64,Golden Brown Bar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"They have a good collection of cocktails and the decor is quite good. Food-wise it is a decent thai place, but not the best in town."
