Great and attentive! …"
1,Vergulde Gaper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was very good and we were in a rush and so the service was quick and server was very nice. My burger was fantastic, and I would definitely get it again. A few of the ravioli were slightly undercooked and tough but I think that was our fault for rushing it due to our time constraint. Everything was delicious."
2,Vergulde Gaper, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place has good ambiance. They played good music  (American eighties pop) and the service was friendly. However,  the food was just fair. I ordered a club sandwich. The bread was overly dry and crusty. I also had onion rings which were …"

13,Vergulde Gaper, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Really liked the vibe of the place. You can hear yourself think. No “kid” menu but well-behaved  kiddos (ours was kept busy with coloring books) having a plain burger will do just fine. I had the special pork tenderloin plate and it was …
