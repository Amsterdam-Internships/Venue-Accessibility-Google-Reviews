0,Kiosk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff here has much more attention for each other than for the customer. The coffee is pretty expensive as well, although tasty. Overall far from a stellar experience probably fuelled by lack of competition."
1,Kiosk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"after a long day of work, what else than a nice cappuccino with your gf to warm you up before going home?
NOPE. â€¦"
2,Kiosk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"No surprise there are bad reviews about the blond girl serving at night. But clearly Kiosk doesn't care, reason why I am not going to give them my money anymore. Arrogant, rude and contentious. I asked 2 coffees, got one. But even if I â€¦"
3,Kiosk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Two chatty women gave looks of disgust when I approached with a water and banana. One sharply stated ""no cash"" followed by a gum slap in her mouth. ""Pay over there with a card"". She didn't motion, point, or indicate where. I'm fairly certain they accept cash. More certain she shouldn't have a job here."
4,Kiosk, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horrible staff. Super rude already 8am!! Imagine if you order a coffe at 17h...maybe they beat you? I like the cakes and capuccino but the staff made me switch to broodzaak.

9,Kiosk, 1 star ,5 months ago,(Translated by Google) Disinterested and curt. Small adult woman with straight hair and tail in. Very unfriendly. â€¦
10,Kiosk, 1 star ,a year ago,(Translated by Google) Create an issue window or open your right cash register if you are alone and use the 2nd one as the issue window. You also don't have to go out and in all the time when you get your coffee. â€¦
11,Kiosk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) I have never seen such an impersonal, curt human as the curly lady at this kiosk. Despite the fact that it is busy, it is okay to have a good afternoon or whatever. Only MENEER, with a tone of fire, could just get rid â€¦"
12,Kiosk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Grabbed a cheese croissant from the row of cheese croissants, took a bite and was surprised by ham. Now I am poorer, hungry and I have nothing to rinse that bad taste out of my mouth. Well great... â€¦"
