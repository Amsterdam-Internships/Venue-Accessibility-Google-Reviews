0,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Very nice and cozy atmosphere. A bit crowded even towards the end of the night- loved the vibe tho. Very very nice and talented staff. Pizza is thin and crispy, the toppings are high quality. Prices are more than average (Berlin Standard) ‚Ä¶"
1,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Went to their take away location which is the blue building nearby. The salad I ordered,  Formaggio di capra, was one of the best I've had--the  goat cheese was so creamy and flavorful. The pizza is thin crust and hits the spot."
2,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I was expecting the pizza to be good, but not this good."
3,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious pizza! We went in the eve and sat outside with the heaters on. Such a cute quite little spot. Great food and friendly staff.
4,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Great little restaurant for grabbing a quick meal. Tables are a bit too tightly packed, you can hear the conversation of everyone around you. Gets busy also! Great to sit outside in Summer."
5,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Unfortunately, during my customer experience tonight, one of the servants (blond young guy, who barely speaks english) spilled wine over my coat, which caused a stain and made it smell. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the pizza was decent."
6,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious thin crust pizza. Worth the walk and would definitely go again if I were to come back to Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶
7,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really cool place, pizzas are great. The doe is thin, for me it's the secret of a tasty pizza! Dessert is amazing, by far th best tiramis√∫ in town! Pizzabakkers became my favourite pizza spot in √Åmsterdam."
8,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 1 star ,5 months ago,Why do you always make delivery drivers wait outside? I ate at a couple of your restaurants and every time you guys ask delivery drivers to stay outside even though there is enough space inside and it's raining/cold. Just... Why? ‚Ä¶
9,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"So far, it‚Äôs the best pizza place I‚Äôve been to in Amsterdam. Their tomato sauce is just amazing, you can feel that it‚Äôs home made. Highly recommend (especially for a quick lunch)!"
10,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice pizza, good toppings and dough. Great service.
My current favorite spot for friday pizza. üçï"
11,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Pizza was great and came out in the blink of an eye. Easily consumable by one person because of how thin it is (the margarita at least, perhaps the others have more protein?) so if you have a hearty appetite I'd recommend also ordering a ‚Ä¶"
12,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Overall we really enjoyed our experience! The food was good and reasonably priced, same with the drinks. They squeezed us in before dinner rush which we really appreciated! Only complaint is that our table had no shade outside on a hot day ‚Ä¶"
13,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Probably one of the best pizzas in this area. Also convenient if you are on a boat and want some food.
14,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent Pizzas, We had a Dinner here during our visit in Amsterdam and we would come back again definitely.
Pizza is around 13‚Ç¨ in a Big size. Dinks are mostly organic. Unfortunately no coke offered and no Cash ist accepted. You have to reserve a table because the space is limited."
15,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had a lovely meal here today! Great service - we had food within 15 minutes of arriving. The pizza was delicious!!! We had the Caprese and De Noi which were both fantastic. 10/10 will visit again.
16,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizza was amazing and the atmosphere is peaceful, but since it‚Äôs in Amsterdam it is expensive. You cannot even pay by cash, so it was struggle for us and we are a group. We card owners needed to buy and split the check into many pieces. The restaurant is good, but cash is cash."
17,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic pizza joint in a nice neighbourhood. Busy two level restaurant with wonderful service. Good menu and lovely food. Loved the pizzas and the desserts.

21,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 1 star ,10 months ago,"I loved this place , but last time was absolutely not good. I ordered pizza prosciutto, so they didn‚Äôt have mozzarella and added just eggs ... really !?! The whole pizza didn‚Äôt look nice and not tasty at all. And they didn‚Äôt cut it."
22,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Probably one of the best pizzas I had !

26,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Super good crust!!!!! Topping could be better BUT we are very thankful this is a dog friendly establishment. Also, Peroni!!!!!1!"
27,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Better pizza, than I would expect from a restaurant chain. Especially nice the simple ones. Also a really good tiramisu. If you order pizza, go inside the corner door, not in the back with all the delivery services."
28,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We love this place. Great pizzas, great cocktails and friendly staff"
29,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Someone, possibly the waiter, told me with a kind voice that there was a fourthy-minute wait for taking out-with his back faced towards me. I was puzzled and left with a sad feeling about this place. I understand that the guy must have been ‚Ä¶"

32,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place to eat an excellent pizza, with fresh products!! The price and the quality is great, and the neighborhood seems to be calm, just next to the zoo. The menu is great, a small but nice possibilities of choices for antipasti, ‚Ä¶"
33,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious and amazing thin crust pizzas with good quality toppings.
Not 5 starts because we're usually still a little hungry after a pizza. Prices are a little higher then usual but that's ok because the pizzas really are ‚Ä¶"
34,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 1 star ,a year ago,"The service was really poor. We were seating outside on the terrace, rain came and they didn‚Äôt bring umbrella on time so we got drenched. Then they took long time to serve the pizzas which was good. Though due to service won‚Äôt prefer to go again."
35,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Big portion and a good value for money. It also has a nice interior setting.

37,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,a month ago,Good pizza for a good price.
38,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I think this is probably the best pizza in the Netherlands!
39,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Accomodating w/ service, great pizza‚Äôs, but got disappointed with the veggie choice starter; if One gets a pizza, you do not want the same ingredients (lots of cheese and some grilled veggie, w/ a lost olive for starters - salad similar). Like the one on Haarlemmerstraat better for taste and experience."
40,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Pizzas are delicious. There are tables outside. You can ask for a Doggy bag !
41,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Decent pizza, good vibes, friendly service. Also good wine selection"
42,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice thin crust pizza with light toppings. They‚Äôve extended the terrace to the water which is very nice. Very good service, friendly staff!"
43,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty food, convenient, good service.  They serve wine and beer, although for the latter they only server Peroni, but one of our favorites. My goat cheese salad was excellent, and my spouse's mixed green salad was very good.  We each had a ‚Ä¶"
44,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was pretty slow but the waitress was really nice and polite. The quiet, relaxed atmosphere was really nice after a long day touring around he city. Once the food came it was actually really nice. Would go back again but only if it was quiet."
45,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There is not a single thing I would like to be changed in this place - the pizzas are very Italian (in a good way), tasty, with fresh ingredients, quickly served and the staff is very nice and helpful! In addition - prices are almost surprisingly low for such a quality. Highly recommendable restaurant!"
46,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really nice pizza, friendly staff. Does not accept cash"
47,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I enjoyed my pizza until the last crunch. I didn't expect it to be this good honestly, EVERYTHING was so right, the texture, the taste, the amount of ingredients. Apart from that I haven't tried any other dish yet as salad or dessert but will be back for it. I would honestly give a shot to all their pizza."
48,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Snooty service by teens. 3 of us walked right back out. Sorry, your pizza matters less when you have children working with attitudes. Way better service at the nines location. Fast and Courteous Adults there.   Avoid this location. Here on a Friday afternoon. Barely anyone around, yet everyone was too ‚Äúbusy‚Äù for us."
49,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great pizzas. But come on, either sell normal soft drinks or let people bring their own. Went there and I had a friend who had nothing to drink on the menu and they refused he will buy coke and brink it."
50,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, close to the university. Very good pizza,s. Friendly service minded staff. You might need to reserv a table in advance if you are planning to eat in the evening. Highly recommended."
51,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is one of the best Italian places in Amsterdam especially the one in Plantage Kerklaan with its outdoor seating. ‚Ä¶
52,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Wood fired pizza.  Good selection.  For Americans you will need to get used to cozy seating as tables are very close together.  Met Locals and tourists there. Credit cards only.
53,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The Hyatt had De Pizzabakkers as one of three recommended restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.  We were not disappointed.  We enjoyed our stroll over two canals to find a table outside this pizza place.  We ordered a margarita pizza and totally enjoyed it.  Of course, the Proseco might have helped a little."
54,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We ate here with a bigger group very early in the afternoon and even then service was very slow, and they had 5 people running around, they forgot to being things a few times. Also the pizza are ok but for the price they are at I had expected there to be more toppings and my pizza was almost bare, and thus very dry."
55,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is nice as it has quite some seats. We went there on a Wednesday night and, despite being a bit full and without reservation, we manage to get a table straight away. Staff was very helpful and friendly and we got our order very ‚Ä¶"

57,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent pizza! The crust was thin and crunchy and the toppings were well thought out. Service was good. The place doesn't accept cash. Highly recommend this place if you feel like having a good pizza.
58,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"People rating this pizzeria with less than 4 stars should be stoned to death.
I got one of the best pizzas I ever had in my life and I really love pizza.
The pizza is even better than at Haarlemmerdijk. ‚Ä¶"
59,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best pizza and friendly staff. I went here to just have a snack and didn't expect much, but turned out pizza here is amazing!"
60,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I havent actually eaten in this place, but I can tell that the people are really nice. Basically me and my friends just got out from an exam and wanted to open a bottle of wine, but we didn't have an opener. We tried with keys but it didn't ‚Ä¶"

70,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,6 years ago,This was a nice discover in our first night in amesterdam. It was quite busy but the staff found a table in 5 minutes. The pizza was good and abundant. The lemoncello cheese cake and espresso were also super.

74,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff were very accommodating, didn't have a reservation but they were able to squeeze us in before the dinner rush. Great pizza at a reasonable price"
75,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Awful place.. Stay away from it. Can you imagine a Pizza Napolitana with barely a hint of anchovies and a tunna pizza with no tomato sauce and totally tasteless? No drinking options are offered. A cheap place for a low-taste meal
76,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"One of the beter pizza places in the area. Excellent service, good prices and great wine. Can be a bit busy on peak hours. They don't deliver but definitely worth stopping by for take out."

78,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was delicious but the service was terrible. 40 minute wait for the pizza and by the time they returned to our table the kitchen was closed so no dessert. Very slow service, seemed a bit lazy. Ruined our experience :("

81,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing pizza and friendly staff. They seem to speak English just as well as Dutch. The restaurant floor was a little crowded, but they're popularity is more than justified."
82,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely restaurant with very friendly staff. Food was yummy! Great for both lunch and dinner with very reasonably priced prosecco. It was so nice that we went twice in 4 days while in amsterdam on holiday.
83,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Best pizza chain in NL
84,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Cool pizza place. The pizzas are just ok though and staff not that friendly. We were waiting for a seat but no line or names were taken which resulted in some people coming after us and seating before us...
85,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizza's are good here, as in all Pizzabakkers, but the presentation got a little sloppy. The should up their game a little. Nice staff and switft service."
86,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious thin crust Italian style pizzas. Warm and welcoming service and fair pricing. Definitely worth a visit.
87,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Do not ignore this place. Gorgeous luxurious foccacia to start with and a glass of fruity prossecco (add salt to the foccacia and olive oil- and you will enjoy more). ‚Ä¶

Thats why, when they are looking for a place for you, their eyes are telling ‚Ä¶"
91,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Our diner was really good. The pizzas were professionally prepared and were delicious. Desert (Chocolate taart and Limoncello Cheesecake) was even better. Thanks for that.

Definitely will be going back to this restaurant when I‚Äôm back in Amsterdam."
94,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you can, snag a table outside, some wine and watch the world go by. Oh, and the pizza is pretty awesome. The crust is thin and chewy with crispy ends."
95,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very tasty pizza with top quality ingredients.. A bit cramped space to sit. Definetely call to ask if you have a baby and a stroller

98,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 1 star ,2 years ago,Didn't even get to try the food. Waited for a while by the door while several waiters and waitresses just passed by as if we didn't exist. Finally someone noticed us and said they have no tables. These guys clearly aren't interested in serving customers.
99,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is great! They use paper straws for juices witch is good , but they put plastic lemon squeezer to every single glass of water"

101,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely delicious pizza, great drinks and friendly staff."
102,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best pizza in a long while.
Take-out sometimes isn't as high quality as eating in, so best to check your pizza before leaving with it."
103,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Didn't eat there, just went to visit a friend who works here. Have eaten there before. Good pizza, tbh."
104,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Really nice food, service and atmosphere. Very small beer selection though. They were nice enough to squeeze us in for dinner even though we didn't have a reservation -- thanks!"

111,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really good but as an Italian I prefer the pizza heavier on ingredients and pasta and lighter on the Mascarpone
112,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I wasn't super impressed. Kind of tasted like a bad take on New York style pizza. Then again maybe I don't appreciate this style of pizza.
113,De Pizzabakkers Plantage, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Best pizza's in het neighborhood, especially the crust. Nice place, friendly service, good atmosphere."
