0,Gary's Deli, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Location is great; where you can get a good view on people passing by. There is ample of (comfortable) sitting options available in and outside. The decorum lacks character though, it's all very bland/generic. The music selection was great ‚Ä¶"
1,Gary's Deli, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Just reopened after a major renovation....rebuilt to the studs! I didn't realize Gary's Deli was here for so many years until I looked at reviews from other sites. I'm so glad they are open again so I can get some ""american style"" bagels on ‚Ä¶"
2,Gary's Deli, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Big new space, no reservation need. Food was mediocre. Bagel wasn‚Äôt toasted."
3,Gary's Deli, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Absolutely fantastic food and service! Even though we don‚Äôt live near here, we will definitely be taking the tram here regularly to eat. For any expats out there looking for proper ‚Äúspicy‚Äù food. This place has it!"
4,Gary's Deli, 1 star ,5 months ago,There was a bug in my food...so they gave me 50% off ...maybe as I had eaten exactly half when I discovered it... ü¶ßü§¢ #worstcustomerserviceever #awful #maybebecauseiwasniceaboutit

7,Gary's Deli, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"By far my favourite place to get bagles in Amsterdam. But now I'm in love with their grilled chicken salad. Fresh and super tasty. Friendly and helpful staff, great coffee, a place to take your friends out"
8,Gary's Deli, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really good latte and smoked salmon/cream cheese bagel - reminds me of Montreal style bagels back home - which I love! A busy place, but would come back again!"

13,Gary's Deli, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great coffee and good service, the food smells good but I just ate so ill stick with coffee"
14,Gary's Deli, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I'm not sure what happened with Gary's Deli, but in my opinion the quality of both the food and the coffee (and, yes, the service) went down quite a bit from, say, two or three years ago. The place wasn't busy but the staff took its time before even acknowledging customers. The coffee tasted bad and the bagel was stale. What happened?"
15,Gary's Deli, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Place is a good location, but average with all respects. Pancakes only on a Sunday so was disappointed but they probably are good. Coffee was not great tasting but bagels were great !"
