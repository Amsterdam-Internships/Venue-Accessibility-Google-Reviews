1,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of the best places in Amsterdam to sit and enjoy a coffee. Close to the packed centre but normally not too crowded and usually full of locals. Good selection of beans to take home. I need to enrol in one of their classes soon.
2,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Not far from the overloaded center, you could find a place to recharge with a cup of coffee. There are also workplaces 6€/ hour if you want. Love its design too. It saves me from a rainy and moody day in Amsterdam."
3,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Fantastic place to grab a coffee and chill out. The atmosphere is very relaxed, and the environment very original to this place. The coffee itself is also amazing – can highly recommend the cortado! Also, the prices are not to crazy. Anyone should go here instead of the big commercial places like Starbucks etc."
4,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Beautiful coffee place with a variety of options. The lattes were delicious and the cakes very tasteful. The staff was also very friendly.
5,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Still on a hunt for relaxed and nice coffee places in Amsterdam. I don't like writing not so good reviews, but I'd like to think this one is constructive feedback.This place has potential to be cozy if they change their furnitures and the …"
6,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"One of my favorite coffee places in the city. Always delicious coffee and snacks, lovely and outstanding service. Would recommend trying filter coffee with any of their beans variety. …"
7,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Favourite place to buy coffee beans (they also grind it for you) for use at home. We tried a couple of other coffees from elsewhere and went back to Bocca cos it just tastes better. Also lovely place for sitting in and drinking coffee/ chatting in larger groups/ working (but make sure you respect their working policy :))) )
8,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I have tried the ''Long Black'' coffee at this place. It legitimately tasted like heaven. I tried so many different coffees in Amsterdam and this was easily one of the best. The tased was so rich and in tense, exactly what I was looking for. Try the coffee with the cocoa hint, you won't regret it!"
9,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,Wow! Probably the best coffee in Amsterdam! My oat milk latte was fantastic: strong enough to wake me up and incredibly delicious! Perfect milk & coffee combination! And their vegan banana bread is to die for... the best I’ve ever tried. …
10,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Bocca has good coffee and it's a nice place. It recently has felt a lot less welcoming however. They close off half of the space for coworking it seems, where you need to pay an hourly fee to sit at a table. People just having a regular …"
11,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Was looking forward to visit this place but it didn't turn out to be so nice.
Don't recommend the chai or hot chocolate. Both had too much cinnamon on top and full of powdery bits. …"
12,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely loved this space... Very spacious and very welcoming.... The lady making the coffee was very warm and helpful. The coffee that i tried was a blend and it was really yummy with just that very light bitter after taste.... Loved it. …
13,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,"A total disappointment.  First of all the staff not welcoming at all or smiling. Then, flies on the cakes, and finally ridiculous quantities for an expensive price.  The place is nice but the rest is not worth it."
14,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nicely designed coffee roastery.
I went there after my friends’ recommendation and I really liked it.
Very polite and fast service. …"
15,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favourite place to get a pour over. It's spacious, manages to keep a calm atmosphere even when busy. The open bar gives you a nice view of the coffee being prepared and you can see the staff care about the end result as much as the …"
16,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very helpful and nice staff, keen to discuss coffee. Lots of space although it does not mean it's easy to find a seat - the place is becoming more and more popular.  Good location, close to popular walking routes. Also selection of sweet things was increased. Note that Bocca does not accept cash any more."
17,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This super trendy cafe is located in pretty central area along with lots of pubs and clubs. The spacious interior creates a surprise for customers come in from a walk between typical Amsterdam town houses. …
18,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Great coffee and decor! But rude staff. I ordered 2 cappuccino and got told that only 1 particular corner was open for service, so we have to sit there. One of the ladies then called out  '2 Cappuchino' and thinking it was our order, I got …"
19,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Bocca is getting a horrible place after being my favorite spot in the town for 2 years….staff made me feel uncomfortable and treat us like we are some tourists. they dont serve food after 5pm and they started to charge 6 euro for using your own laptop .  Thankfully coffee was still good…and here you go 2 stars.
20,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Spacious cafe with decent coffee. The atmosphere is nice. Coffee menu is limited but coffee is good. Contrary to having so much space, the number of seating and tables they have available is limited (they said due to the type of permit they have) so you might have to wait or go elsewhere."
21,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Bocca was founded by a Dutchman who began his search for the perfect coffee bean in Ethiopia. Natural light fills the warehouse-like interior, which has high ceilings, white walls and a mix of bar seating and cosy sofa areas. A long table …"
22,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place, great coffee and delicious deserts! It is quite big place and I would definitely come back if I am in Amsterdam, they also say that laptops ARE allowed during the weekend, and this would definitely make a good work/chill-out …"

25,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Awesome coffee and very friendly and professional staff. We had a refreshingly citric kenyan Cold drip, an amazing tanzania filter coffee and a very nice cocoa lemonade. Everything tasted really good. And 10,20€ in total is really …"
26,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had an espresso to go. It was very strong and great flavor. They do have also some croissants and snack choices. Stuff was friendly and fast. Would reccomend to all coffee lovers to taste their unique flavor coffee bean. Atmosphere was also cozy.
27,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,2 months ago,This place has been my favorite coffee place in Amsterdam for the past five years. Unfortunately I got a cup of latte at room temperature today. The milk was most likely not steamed. Quite a disappointment on a cold winter day.
28,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Very beautiful venue in a cosy street, outside of all the hustle and bustle of the city. The beans that they sell are the best quality. They can also give you advice on your options. …"
29,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Really good coffee, the vibe is not always great

Edit to reply: what makes the vibe not great is that I never really feel like …"
30,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 1 star ,5 months ago,"They charge 6 euros per hour for using your laptop in the cafe, even if you buy drinks and food. So you can read a book, you can sit and have a chat with  a friend, but without even opening the laptop, otherwise you have to pay. Ridiculous. …"
31,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great vibe and coffee. It’s a place you can easily come with a friend to catch up, to relax and read a book with a coffee as well as work for part of the day. There’s a table around the back which is handy if you come to do some work."
32,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Super Good coffee, really friendly staff. Great for relaxing"
33,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"This place used to be my go-to coffee spot in Amsterdam. I still think their beans and coffee are really good, but their new staff lately........is so rude. Makes me not want to go there anymore, which is a shame."
34,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"I really like it here, but the coffee taste every day so different .. like a lottery.
My friends feel the same like me And why they almost every week change barista?? So curious..and weird."
35,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing coffee house and beautiful coffee school, the thing is the the coffee was awful. So sour I almost could not drink it. I wish the seller would let me know about the options or that the coffee is unique or theat there was a sign or …"
36,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Unfortunately, they had no filter coffee makers that day, but I suggested that they should make an americano then. The americano was very good. Used some berry-fruity beans. The atmosphere is very cozy and warm. There are not that many places to sit though since it's quite busy. We had a good time!"
37,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Coffee was good and portion was fine.

However, the size of the food portion is ridiculous. As you can see it was one …"

41,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Home to one of Amsterdam’s best specialty coffee brands. Nice and spacious location to chill out in the weekends. Decent spot to open up your laptop as well. Can get busy, mainly cause the coffee is just awesome. 😋"
42,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,"While the best coffee is the one you have with a good friend, Bocca Coffee is a cool place to go if you are looking for a quality time alone. For expert coffee lovers as well as for novice people, at Bocca Coffee you can have great …"

46,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love this place! Open and chill atmosphere. Calming wooden interior and green plants. Superkind and serviceminded baristas. Nice coffee. Definetly worth a visit.
47,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Average coffee and sweets , but not recommend to order other food. French toast are really bad and far away from French (I visited Paris a year ago). Not cheap, but good service. I think this huge place without special atmosphere and style."
48,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,10 months ago,I always buy beans from Bocca (also in Marqt). My kinto tumbler from there is also a piece of art. Raspberry brownies - to die for. When everything was opened i preferred to take aeropress or other black alternatives (now making aeropress …

50,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The Cappuccino was really really good, had a nice aroma and wasn‘t bitter at all. Could have been a bit more (the seize) but quality counts. Also the Café is really nice and modern inside."
51,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious coffee, nice place, great breakfast!
I just wish staff pay more attention to seated customers :) and not keep them waiting too long for taking order (or just ask after some time if they want anything else..)"

54,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"It was cool, but as all new, after some time, is already lost the quality. Super slow service, instead of our order, the waitress girl brought s.o.'s, moreover, replaced coffee was not with the beans which we have ordered. Very tired staff, …"

56,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best coffee place I found in Amsterdam, and I tried out more than a few. They offer good variety of coffee origins and roasts, as well as a variety of brewing methods.  If you're looking to get a pour-over, this is the place, but their espresso was top notch as well.  I ended up going here multiple times during my stay."
57,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Had the soy hot chocolate and the chocolate raspberry cake.  The hot chocolate had a weird and bitter flavour to it, I wouldn’t recommend it. …"
58,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 1 star ,3 months ago,"A friend of mine lost his face mask before he come to the cafe and they forced him to leave it is from the decency maybe to offer him one of the stuff face mask it come only 2 cents!!???

61,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Cute shop but bad coffee. I got an extremely sour espresso. Too bad it was a double. brew time or grind size needs to be adjusted.
62,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee in a large light filled space and friendly customer service, only giving four stars as they only have one size for takeaway coffee which is quite small (and I love a large coffee) but otherwise everything is perfect here."
63,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent coffee and hot chocolate! It is a spacious coffee shop with good vibes and friendly well mannered staff.
64,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent coffee and friendly service. Bocca is a local favourite, but it’s located in a very touristy area. There’s plenty of seating and the vibe is welcoming and cosy. No laptops allowed after 11am in the main seating area, but the single origin filter coffee is worth the sacrifice."
65,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is one of my favorite places to get coffee in Amsterdam. Just around the corner from the busy Leidseplein you’ll find a truly beautiful, cozy place to enjoy some of the best coffee in town. My favorite is the oat cappuccino. I also …"

I love going there for my coffee break.
Highly recommended !"
67,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We come here at least twice a week. Always love the coffee,  friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. We come here for business meetings as well. Today I was surprised by the nice artwork on my coffee. This dragon on my coffee deserves 5 stars... eventhough I asked for a penguin. :p"
68,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place for a break, right next to one of the busiest area of Amsterdam. The café is spacious and not full of tables, which allows you to breath and enjoy the awesome coffees, teas or lemonades. You can as well buy bags of coffee if you'd like to + the accessories to do it yourself!"
69,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"So happy I found this place. Stayed at the hostel down the road and that does not make for a good sleep. Luckily Bocca had three solution.
Wonderful coffee. Love the cupping card for extra information.
Highly recommend coming here if you are in Amsterdam"
70,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Coffee is amazing! As it’s stated earlier, probably the best one in Ams. However, I wish it was cheaper or in larger sizes 😕"
71,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Slow & intermittent service, borderline cold latte, limited laptop area policy after 11 am might be a problem if you are planning to do some work. my wife finished her coffee and I am still waiting for mine ten minutes and counting ;) Finally arrived after 20 min."
72,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent set up they've got going here, a lovely calm neutral coffee shop. With simplicity and cosy vibes in a modern environment. The shop is spacious and light filled providing an intimate environment perfect for working while drinking …"
73,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 2 stars ,2 months ago,"Really expensive for what you get. I mean it's Amsterdam and not Berlin, but the food portions were super small. We had 3 options of the menu, but were still hungry afterwards. The juice is not pressed freshly. It's out of a plastic bottle. …"
74,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Do not miss — this place exceeds on all marks. Coziness - 11/10 , coffee 12/10 and my personal favorite was the cupping notes and regional info that came along with my Latte. Perfect for all of you coffee nerds out there!"
75,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In my opinion they have the best coffee in Amsterdam! Every cup of coffee is made with care, precision and love by a super friendly barista. I’d also recommend trying their coffee tonic, it’s a combination you’d never think would work but somehow it does!"
76,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Wonderful atmosphere, great service, really great coffee, and a pretty damn good cheesecake."
77,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Great place, good vibe and great coffee."
78,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic and surprisingly spacious coffee place which takes its coffee very serious, and rightly so. Received a little card with my cortado which showed the provenance of the beans. Loved it."
79,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent coffee and breakfast for a very fair price. They take care about serving fair trade products. Can definitely recommend them!
80,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Superior coffee quality, nice service, friendly interior. Great place to enjoy and taste freshly brewed dark coffee (V60) from different regions. Please, don’t come if you want to drink cappuccino or laté in huge cups. That’s not this kind of place )"
81,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely coffee house that welcomes you to relax and enjoy while sippin your double espresso. Currently my favorite coffee house in Amsterdam.
82,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very modern space with lots of room. Their flat white was good. It's a nice place to hang around. They allow laptops over the weekend so if you have anything to work on, this would be perfect space for you."
83,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,They serve creamy latte in a very cozy comfortable atmosphere. Staffs are friendly and cute :) They have a small area for computer users.
84,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Perfect coffee (I hear they even have their own super expensive water filtration system in the basement, because Amsterdam drinking water -which is often rated the cleanest city tap water on the planet- isn’t quite clean enough for Bocca’s beans 🤩)"
85,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not a great variety of meals for breakfast and lunch but has all the basics : granola, toasts and pastries. …"
86,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Such a beautiful space! We had a very tasteful hazelnut lemon cake along with an avocado toast loaded with delicious toppings. The coffee was also very good. This place was a definite hit with me: no laptops on weekends!

88,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 1 star ,5 months ago,"This cafe used to be the best
Now it seems they let amateurs make the coffee, something terribly has changed
The bakery is still top notch"
89,Bocca Coffee Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great espresso coffee. Regular white = latte, small white = macchiato. Spacious coffee shop with relaxed seating. Only carrot cake, a bit of chocolate and lemon slices for food, so mainly good for coffee here. And tea."
