12,Caf√© Fonteyn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Decidedly local pub with a nice relaxing vibe while still being in the fray of central Amsterdam's tourism epidemic. Staff are friendly and it's a great place for groups or couples to enjoy a beverage. The summer months make for fantastic terrace cafe culture with sunny afternoon weather to be had if you are there on the right day.
13,Caf√© Fonteyn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Stumbled upon this place while looking for a place to grab a bite to eat and have a drink or two with my family.  Cozy place.  Good food. Great friendly staff. We stayed longer as it was a nice relaxing place to get off our feet. It also wasn't overly crowded.  Not loud either.

27,Caf√© Fonteyn, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Real Amsterdam cafe with a nice selection of beers and traditional Dutch snacks (bitterballen and kaasstengels), but also Flammkuchen. The staff has a keen eye to serve you a fresh beer should you almost run out. Lovely location on the Nieuwmarkt."

34,Caf√© Fonteyn, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Just in the middle of everything, this bar is mostly attended by locals. The service is surprisingly good for a dutch busy bar. With a wonderful view over the Niewemarkt, or a cozy interior for a rainy day."
35,Caf√© Fonteyn, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Small, cozy, with a good rotation of seasonal beers. Sometimes gets to noisy/packed with tourists, but still, from what Nieuwmarkt has to offer, I tend to always choose Fonteyn."
36,Caf√© Fonteyn, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The Fonteyn is okay for having a snack or drink - nothing really special you have never seen before. As it is located directly at the new market, it is a really busy and crowded area where you can perfectly spent some time by watching people passing by."

44,Caf√© Fonteyn, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best local pubs. Or as we Dutch call them: the ‚ÄòBruine Kroeg‚Äô. Perfect for starting a night out. In the summer time for staking the night out on the terrace.
