4,Coffeeshop Carmona, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very friendly staff, nice relaxed atmosphere inside. Didn't feel unwelcoming or exclusive like a lot of Dutch coffeeshops try to be. Open to a wide array of customers and not in Amsterdam's tourism central which is nice."

19,Coffeeshop Carmona, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Small, too small. Creepy dodgy trance music inadequate for the space, a funny cat walking around, beautiful girl selling the joints.
