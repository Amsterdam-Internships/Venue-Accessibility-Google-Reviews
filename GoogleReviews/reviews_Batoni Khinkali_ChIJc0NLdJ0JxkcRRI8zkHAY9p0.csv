0,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,3 months ago,It's truly a hidden gem in a beautiful part of Amsterdam. We happened to be in the area on a Saturday afternoon and were lucky to get a table without a reservation. We were immediately welcomed by friendly personnel. ‚Ä¶
1,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We had some great tasting Georgian food and wine. Every dish was so unique. The kachapuri (baked bread with cheese and egg) was very delicious. The vegan dish had Khinkali (mushroom dumpling), bean stew, and aubergine wrapped walnut paste ‚Ä¶"
2,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Generally this is obviously the best place with Georgian cuisine that I‚Äôve seen in Western Europe: starting from the interior design which is not following any of the clich√© and in and obviously in the food. All the ‚Äúmust-haves‚Äù were there ‚Ä¶
3,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Amazing service!! The staff was super kind, even though we were a large group (10 people) everyone was taken care of. My favorite was the grilled aubergine with walnut paste. They also have a wide selection of Georgian wine made with ‚Ä¶"
4,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"We were intrigued since we had never tried Georgian food and Georgian restaurants are not so common. The menu is limited and here it guarantees the quality of the food, all home made. We tasted multiple different dishes and all loved the flavor: simple food but well executed. Service was nice as well, we will return."
5,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Excellent service, very kind people. All drinks are from Georgia, including soft drinks and tea's, which I would both happily recommend for everyone to try. Definitely going for the Georgian wines and cocktails next time. Glad to have bumped into this welcoming and out-of -the-ordinary place!"
6,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Cozy place with a good service! Meat khinkali are my favourites, I‚Äôd love to have some sauces along but didn‚Äôt see them in the menu card. Khachapuri is super cheesy and softüòã"

10,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice place with great food and pleasant ambience! Grilled aubergines as a starter are amazing. Both khinkali and khachapuri are delicious. Would definitely recommend to accompany the meal with a glass of Georgian wine! Very friendly stuff.

16,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I've fallen in love with Georgian food since 2012, when I first tried it in Moscow! This restaurant in Amsterdam is simply amazing and I've been here twice already. Their bread dough is excellently prepared for you - fresh and hot when it ‚Ä¶"
17,Batoni Khinkali, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"This is the only Georgian restaurant in town. The starters were great - I would go back just for the dumplings! But the main courses left something to be desired, especially at the prices they are charging. Ask about the art on the walls - it has a cool story."
18,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"If you like Georgian food then you are in for a treat.
We had the khinkali mix which was filled with meat, mushrooms and cheese, the mini khachapuri and the chicken with spicy walnut sauce. All dishes were ‚Ä¶"
19,Batoni Khinkali, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the few places to eat Georgian food. It was quite busy when we arrived. They don‚Äôt have enough personnel to cover all the guests. They forgot to give us the menu, whether we already ordered or even to give us a glass for the drink I ordered."
20,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"An absolute go-to! What an exquisite little place on the border of Amsterdam South and Centre. Extending their restaurant with a gorgeous terrace, suitable to fit approximately 6-7 tables, this seemingly small place can cater for a lot of ‚Ä¶"

22,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,You must do reservation as the place is always fully booked. Loved the experience and food. It was super busy and packed.

23,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, we loved it! We ordered the starter, and the 2 most ordered dishes! Absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend, prices are good and the sweet wine is the best. Beautiful location also, cosy and small restaurant. Don't miss it!"
24,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"The dishes were very delicious, diverse and for a fair price. Also the wine menu is great and offers a nice Georgian wine selection. The place itself is very cosy with stylish furniture. Only minus was the service; unfortunately the waitress didn‚Äòt know much about the dishes and the wines. However, I‚Äòll be back for sure!"
25,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"With the corona measures in town you have to be creative to keep it going.

27,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This Georgian restaurant is nice to visit if you miss Georgian food or have never tried it, but the dishes are quite overpriced (it is okay considering Amsterdam prices though) and it is quite noisy in there as there is not a lot of space. ‚Ä¶"
28,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food! It was my first time eating Georgian food and I absolutely loved it. The owner is kind and friendly and the food was absolutely delicious. It's still quite new so the waiting times are quite long if the restaurant is full but to ‚Ä¶

30,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place if you don't like long menus with 50 dishes and 26 variants. Simple menu, you can easily go through it all in one seating as long you have company, which will be useful to combat the cheese pie."
31,Batoni Khinkali, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"2 Stars just for the food, it was very delicious. We were waiting 2 hours for Mstvadi which never come. No stars for the Service, the Service was horrible nur the chef sympathic, he cooked just in time. Prices too expensive. We are from georgia too, food was great!"

42,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I love Georgian cuisine. I was happy to find out this place in Amsterdam. I was so excited about khinkali. Except for the traditional ones with meat, they have plenty of them with different fillings. Anyway, my favourite is with meat, they ‚Ä¶"

46,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic (and delicious) tastes of Georgia right here in Amsterdam. From the khinkali (Georgian dumplings) to the badrijani nigvzit (aubergine with walnut stuffing), each morsel is lovingly made by hands with a passion for what they do. ‚Ä¶"
47,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great authentic Georgian restaurant in great Amsterdam location. Worth taking a look - delicious food and fair prices
48,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Yes, good Georgian food in Amsterdam! Very kind service and great food (similar to what you get in Georgia). Georgian wines and hospitable owner. But it feels like he needs some help in terms of staff. Keep it up and we will be back!"
49,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, really lovely Georgian wine! Our waiter was so nice and was clearly passionate about sharing the food. Very highly recommended."
50,Batoni Khinkali, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We have previously visited another Georgian restaurant so we came to this one with pretty high expectations, but unfortunately we were disappointed, mainly because the khachapuri cheese was a mix of Mozrella and Goat cheese instead of using the original Georgian cheese!"
51,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,First time I had Georgian food and it was absolutely delicious. Red wine was also very good.
52,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Super authentic food. The restaurant setting is quite fancy which doesn't suit the 'streetfood' style starters. However, the main dishes are fancier and smaller portions, which suit the ambience in the restaurant. As my husband is veggie ‚Ä¶"

58,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Only Georgian restaurant in Amsterdam. Limited selection of food, all the Georgian classics. Had khachapuri and some khinkali, both excellent. Lovely Georgian wine, too. If you like Georgian food or have yet to try it you won't be disappointed here."

60,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A great experience! If you want to try something different and/or are curious about Georgian cuisine, this is the place! Delicious food, quiet and elegant place, friendly service. The wine was overpriced. I highly recommend this restaurant."
61,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went to this place for lunch on Sunday, lovely environment, delicious food and good service. It took a bit of time to wait for food,but it was not a problem for us at all, in the end the meal was very tasty."

63,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We tried hachapuri, and Khinkali with meet and cheese and champinions l. Honestly, hachapuri is better. Much more taste and super fresh and tasty. Khinkalu with champinions were a bit dry and they did not have a souse for them. I will be back for Hachapuri."
64,Batoni Khinkali, 1 star ,a year ago,"We had to wait in the queue for 1,5 hour to get the food to go, we specifically asked dishes to go, but the waiter brought them on the plate. We asked them to pack it, after what we saw her giving our food to the other people (unbelievable ‚Ä¶"

66,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,6 months ago,delicious hearty food but a bit pricey for what is usually considered a street food such as khachapuri and khinkali. definitely worth a stop when in Amsterdam.

83,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,a year ago,Kachapuri is good and has very big portions with very reasonable price. One big one is enough for 2 people. They have some good wine and boy it hits from the very first glass. Wine is expensive part here. It starts from 34 euro for a bottle but the best one is with clay about 43 euros for a bottle.

Make sure you reserve table, as it was very packed!"
99,Batoni Khinkali, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food wasn‚Äôt amazing and the service was quite slow. Food came at different times as well. We were 7 people. Prices are high. A simple salad costs you 6 euros, for instance. Giving it 3 stars because the staff was decent enough. One of them was quite nice actually. I won‚Äôt be coming back. Sorry."
100,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Cosy place with decent food, not much choice, but the classics of Georgian cuisine are in place. Not much space, so it's better to reserve a table. Nice neighborhood close to Vondelpark, perfect spot for Sunday lunch and a walk after."

104,Batoni Khinkali, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Georgian cuisine, my clients told me it has nothing to do with the real georgian cuisine. The price you pay for whatyou get is defenitly not worth it and the portions are very small. Nice to try it out, but thats actually it. ‚Ä¶"
105,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious khinkali and phkali that taste just like the ones we had in Tbilisi. Added bonus: It's not on the menu, but you can also ask for your khinkali to be fried. Georgian wine is also really good. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming and unpretentious."

This has nothing in common with it, you only give bad impression of the country's traditional food. Sirtskhvilia!"

139,Batoni Khinkali, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Haven't been a couple of months.. I still enjoy the food, but what I don't get is why service is still bad! Really upgrade the service, stop playing Eric Clapton on repeat, and it will be a great place to experience a little bit of Georgia!"
140,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Georgian place in Amsterdam, with a small but very delicious menu. Not expensive at all. Advice: do not order khachapuri and khinkali on the same go - it's too much, even though those two are delicious!"
141,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good Georgian restaurant. Food is proper.
142,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The only Georgian cuisine place in Amsterdam - so if you are missing khinkali and khachapuri it‚Äôs a place to go! Good service, simple menu with all the delicious things I‚Äôve been craving and good location in Oud Zuid."
143,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food! Delicious! Especially Khinkali and Khachapuri was just great. Super friendly stuff. Definitely will go back again and again!
144,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It was an OK option for a dinner out. Certainly wine was a highlight of the night. Food not really in my tastes but I'm sure the restaurant is good quality and it's a matter of cuisine.
145,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,a year ago,Though I have never been here but I will recommend Georgian food to everyone! Specially KHINKALI and Khachapuri (Acharian!) are my favourites! I will come for sure to taste them
146,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Georgian food and wines. Reasonably priced.
147,Batoni Khinkali, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Georgian cuisine is famous because of size. Food is very delicious but too small and too expensive... please guys, you are georgians and you know better how look like georgian food..."

149,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really good ‚Ä¶ as in‚Ä¶ wildly good wine!
150,Batoni Khinkali, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Georgian cafe, a rare find in Amsterdam but unfortunately not quite up there in terms of authenticity or good value for money. Portions are small, food just ok. A bit on the pretentious side, if you'll excuse my honesty (speaking as a partial Georgian here). Come to this place for GOOD SERVICE and EXPENSIVE SNACKS üëç"
151,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The staff is attentive and the service is quite fast. There are traditional Georgian dishes in the menu. Khinkali and khachapuri are must try.

157,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Can't endorse there being a Georgian restaurant in Amsterdam enough. It's not close to the best Khinkali I've had and their khachapuri is on the small side, but all authentic and tasty."
158,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The food and service are excellent, but it is a bit overpriced and the portions are really tiny."

160,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for Georgian food and wine. The most noteworthy dishes they have (khinkali, khachapuri and phkali). Hopefully some more variety will come soon."
161,Batoni Khinkali, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Needed to wait for one hour for two khinkali, which were nothing close to real khinkali if you have ever tasted them. Small dumplings with strange mixture of meat, as well as strange spices which you would never see in real dish. Pkhali was also weird. Never again."
162,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Try the kinkhali with meat and the kachapuri <3
163,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely the best Georgian restaurant in Amsterdam. Levan is a role model in both service and wine knowledge.

167,Batoni Khinkali, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As a Georgian food lover, I really enjoyed the khinkali and the khachapuri along with some Georgian wines. Small but tasty menu!"
168,Batoni Khinkali, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Was a bit disappointed by the scarcity of the menu. On the Georgian cuisine side it has just khachapuri and khinkali with 3 filling options. There's definitely a room for improvement!
169,Batoni Khinkali, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Batoni Khinkali is a small island of hipster Georgia. It used to be a pop-up restaurant, but now they settled on a small cozy square, serving short, but well balanced menu ‚Äî wine and khinkali."
170,Batoni Khinkali, 2 stars ,4 months ago,It is so far from the georgian cuisine...

182,Batoni Khinkali, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Sunday, 29-07, 6.30pm - we drove all the way from Laren to try their khinkali. The place was closed with no explanation whatsoever. The website/facebook page did not mention anything either. This is extremely disappointing. Will not come again."
