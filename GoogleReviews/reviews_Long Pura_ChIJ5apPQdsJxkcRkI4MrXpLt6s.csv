3,Long Pura, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The beef rendangis tender, the seasoning is not stingy with spices..the chicken soup is awesome, the shrimp soup is also recommended..the perfect choice to fulfill the longing for Indonesian cuisine"
4,Long Pura, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Honestly, the waiting was ridiculously long. The staff were really nice but not very great at their job. There was 1 dish that was really good the (lamb satay) and another dish (fish) that was decent but other than that, everything else was …"
5,Long Pura, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"For a first timer eating Indonesian food, I had no expectations but after the meal my husband and I were disappointed. We ordered the 3 course meal at 36 euros p.p. The appetizer (chicken soup) was amazing. It was what we needed after a …"

We wind or eight people for dinner. The place looks very nice clean and the staff extremely hospitable. …"
8,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is very close to having a traditional Indonesian Rijsttafel.  Food was really tasty, 4 courses including dessert.  Cost was about 50 euro per person."
9,Long Pura, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great Indonesian food with a variety of set menus.  Friendly staff who gave us good service.  Only disappointing thing was that the white wine was warm when poured out at room temperature.  They did give us an ice bucket to chill the rest of the bottle.

14,Long Pura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The very best off the best in Indonesian cooking and rijstafel. A yearly must do when we visit The Netherlands.servixe is tops. The price is well worth the trip.....of the senses
15,Long Pura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I have to visit Long Pura every time I come to Amsterdam. Ignore everything else on the menu and choose from their selections of Rijst Tafel. Absolutely delicious. Although the goat sate was the highlight of the meal.
16,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly staff. The guy at the entrance helped me through the menu and catered for my vegan food request. Definitely a hallmark of my visit to Amsterdam. Would come back again for sure.
17,Long Pura, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice Indonesian restaurant with a beautiful interior. Be advised to not get seated near the door during winter, because you will get cold. Better to get a seat in the back. …"
18,Long Pura, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The atmosphere is spot on in this Indonesian restaurant. The food was ok. We had the larger rijsttafel, we loved this fish, goat and shrimp dishes however the beef and lamb dishes were way over cooked. They were almost dusty. The veggie dishes were pretty bland. I expected more from the food."
19,Long Pura, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good services dor their guests. Food was delicious
20,Long Pura, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"All the food was delightful and the service was nice, just be prepared to spend €50 per person. It's worth it if you can afford it."

We made reservations online for the same evening and the place was moderately …"

25,Long Pura, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, great ambiance, great staff!!!! Best Indonesian food in Amsterdam"
26,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was absolutely excellent! First time eating Indonesian food and it was delicious. Went with locals who eat Indonesian quite regularly in Amsterdam and they said this may be their new favorite. We asked for most of it not spicy but honestly even the spicy beef wasnt too ""hot"" - it had GREAT flavor. Would definitely go back."
27,Long Pura, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The food is nice and tasty, but quite pricey for what you get.

The dishes that were supposed to be spicy weren’t spicy at all (if anything, a …"
28,Long Pura, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good services dor their guests. Food was delicious
29,Long Pura, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Wonderful Indonesian food so far from Asia. Really tasty starter satays deserve a special mention!
30,Long Pura, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We went here following other recommendations. Booked online easily enough and got a table for 7.30 on a Saturday.
It didn't meet any of our expectations or match any of the good reviews we had …"
31,Long Pura, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Looong wait and unorganised staff. The food was decent though:/
32,Long Pura, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I don't think I had been to an Indonesian place before this. Indonesian restaurants are all over Amsterdam, and this one was well recommended. It deserved all the kudos it had got. …"
33,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I loved my experience at Long Pura. The place looked very authentic and fancy. We ordered the Warung Ricetable for 2 people and it was perfect. Just under € 27 per person. It comes with a bunch of little plates with different flavors. Some …
34,Long Pura, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Overrated, super slow service, food options some are okay other are bad."
35,Long Pura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This restaurant was quite full when we entered, but the friendly staff was able to accommodate us. We ordered the ""rijsttafel met saté"". Lovely authentic Balinese food presented very well with an explanation given with every dish. Very nice atmosphere. Well worth a visit."
36,Long Pura, 1 star ,3 years ago,I went there as a single person. The entire place was empty but they wanted me to sit at a table basically in the doorway. They did not bring the chips every other table of 2+ got as a starter. Just a few came sprinkled on my plate. The …
37,Long Pura, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent Satay. Chicken Satay was delicious and so was the tofu Satay. The king prawns skewers were also great. …
38,Long Pura, 2 stars ,a year ago,"We ordered the rice table. We waited 1,5 hours for it to come and it was not even very good. It was edible and nobody died, so 2 stars and not 1."
39,Long Pura, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I had been at this place as a first timer to taste Indonesian food. I had tried vegetarian options and they were really good. The ambience was also satisfactory. …
40,Long Pura, 1 star ,2 years ago,"VERY mediocre and very overpriced.
We had 3 differrent type of meals, and we all agreed it was mediocre at best. The veggie meals are very basic and not all that interesting. Also the staff was nice enough, but a bit confusing, and unorganized."
41,Long Pura, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Long Pura … loooooong waiting to get served
42,Long Pura, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Westernized Indonesian food.  Spicy isn't actually spicy, although YMMV.  But - nothing negative to say.  Get one of the ""samplers"" - rather than order a specific dish from the menu if you are new to the cuisine.   A good mix of Dutch and tourists."
43,Long Pura, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not impressed, if Indonesian food is meant to be served luke warm with several dishes looking like brown mush and not a lot of flavour then I've incorrectly rated Long Pura and I should have given it 5 stars. The service was quite good but we won't be returning."
44,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super flavorful Indonesian cuisine. We had the ricetable, as recommended to try many dishes as prepared similar to how they served Dutch royals back historically. We also ordered the goat satay, one of their specialties, and was not …"
45,Long Pura, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here in summer 2015, and recently again in summer 2019. Food still good as I recalled it - Rijsttafel in Amsterdam is always an experience with the various vegetable and meat dishes combined with sauces. Also nice to have southeast Asian food once in a while to break from the European cuisine during visits here."
46,Long Pura, 1 star ,2 years ago,Really long wait times. We were a party of five and ordered the 3 cours ricetable. It took forever to come out. Not a lot of food in the end for 37 euros. Also at the time I felt they had missed some dishes out. When I got home and checked …
47,Long Pura, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great first experience with Amsterdam-Indonesian ""rice table"" dining.  Received multiple dishes (>10) as part of the family style dining, all fantastic. Would definitely return. …"
48,Long Pura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very good restaurant: quick service, the staff speaks really good English, the food is amazing, great flavor combinations. If you know nothing about Indonesian food like I did, go for a rice table, it has a variety and you can pick whatever you like"
49,Long Pura, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"If you want to be teleported to Indonesia, there is no better place in Amsterdam. Rice in banana leaf is amazing."
50,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First time I had Indonesian food . I believe it was the best restaurant to get introduced into the food. The restaurant was perfect , the waiters where very friendly , the manager was fantastic , the prices were reasonable . An AMAZING restaurant with GREAT food, I had a great time."
51,Long Pura, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Now, honestly. I rarely leave reviews unless I feel compelled by outstanding quality or the opposite. This place is the complete opposite and a complete rip-off. We've been having absolutely amazing meals all weekend for two for €50-€60 …"
52,Long Pura, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is very good. The rendang meat is very soft, the opor meat is also soft. They make the food adapted to European customers that are not able to eat spicy. The waiter is very friendly. But here is a bit pricey in my opinion."
53,Long Pura, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food. Good variety. Nice curries and rendang with out being too sweet or spicy. Spot on. Also this restaurant had the best service of anyplace I’ve stopped in Europe. Very attentive. 10/10 would recommend.
54,Long Pura, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I am an indonesian but i don’t recommend this restaurant. I have a bad experience my first time coming here, the female waitress was completely rude and talking back during her service. Her attitude and response was not professional. She really gave a bad impression to indonesia. The waitress was never apologetic with her bad service."
55,Long Pura, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Underwhelming. We ordered the rijstaffle & almost every dish served was a stewed type dish (flavour was a little muted, but OK) The only exception was the gado gado (a little too wilted, seemed like it had been left out too long) & the …"
56,Long Pura, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Our party of 4 had reserved prior to arrival.From the outside looked uninviting,,however the inside was a transformation. We enjoyed their rice table for 4 at 25 euros per head.The service was a pleasure, with smiling attentive staff.the …"
57,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty food. We had the ricetable and found there was plenty of choice, from mild vegetable dishes to quite spicy meat dishes. Friendly staff and reasonably priced for the amount of food you get."
58,Long Pura, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Really enjoyed our first experience of Indonesian cuisine. All the waiters were very helpful and the ambience was cultured!  Would recommend this sophisticated restaurant to all visitors of Amsterdam :)
59,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had a late ish evening and found this lovely joint by chance. The food was excellent. We had a fish sambal that was to die for and the duck dishes were awesome too. Definitely recommended.
60,Long Pura, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This meal was INSANELY good. Every dish was perfect. The sauces for the lamb and chicken satays were unlike anything I've had before. I'm super bummed we went here on our last night in Amsterdam because I want to go back!!
61,Long Pura, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Very good food. The rice was great and both the chicken a prawn dish were delectable. Spices were spot on with the heat at a perfect level as to not destroy the taste. Highly recommended.
62,Long Pura, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This place is terrible to my taste . Servers are nice, but poor service . Food was terrible . We didn’t even finish the food . We ordered rice plates . And had to order just fried rice since the rice plates were bad .  And talk About the …"

66,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Just what we needed after a flight. We ordered vegetarian coconut soup and some spring rolls and shared a main dish which was plenty. Very nice food and ambience.
67,Long Pura, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Long Pura is conveniently located in the Jordaan district and easily accessible by foot from most key spots in Amsterdam.  Decor is ethnic.  Servers greet customers nicely and are dressed in Indonesian garb.  Food is delicious, particularly …"
68,Long Pura, 5 stars ,6 years ago,The best Indonesian restaurant in Amsterdam. As a native Indonesian I find it very difficult to find restaurant that really understand the real Indonesian taste but Long pura defenitely nailed it. The foods tasted so good and remains me so …
69,Long Pura, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Simply excellent. Place was full. Service was prompt and helpful and the food was superb. The spicy eggplant dish ranks alongside anything I have tasted. Highly recommended.
70,Long Pura, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a good time, the Bali cocktail was to my tatste. Food is sometimes too spicy but de knew it in advance. A place to consider."
71,Long Pura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"After some debate online as to which is the best Indonesian restaurant in Amsterdam and visits to a couple (Blauw, Sama Sebo, Kantjil en de Tijger), we decided to try out Long Pura which has been refurbished fairly recently. The food …"
72,Long Pura, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This experience was amazing.  Go for the ""chef's rice table"" and split among friends.  Tons of amazing food and flavors.  Remember that they prefer to only accept a single card for payment!"
73,Long Pura, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food. Great service. Ordered the warung sate which is amazing, but make sure you order ""2x"" for 2 people... We got one serving even though there were 2 of us. …"

75,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This a fantastic local restaurant that serves the best Indonesia food! They even accommodate dietary restrictions such as no peanuts or dairy. Extremely delicious and a good place to eat with friends
76,Long Pura, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Nice interior and very friendly staff. The food served is good but I know a couple of other Indonesian restaurants that do better. The portions were rather small.
77,Long Pura, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Massively overpriced. 30% more than other, better places - go to Ron's gastropub first. Chairs and tables budget style - cocktails are mostly water and ice."
78,Long Pura, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Authentic Indonesian restaurant for dinner. Go for the tasting menu, even the smallest, vegetarian one is a generous meal. The only downside is that we had to wait an hour for our food."
79,Long Pura, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Well cooked Indonesian food. Friendly staff.
80,Long Pura, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food was nothing special, not worth the money. The waitress (the one who wears black not red) is very rude and unwelcoming, will not recommend this place to anyone! Spend your money elsewhere."
81,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good restaurant and fairly priced aswell. I highly recommend doing the chef tasting because otherwise it can be very difficult to figure out everything on the menu.
82,Long Pura, 1 star ,5 years ago,It seems everyone eating there tonight was an American...  It must be listed in guidebooks or something. …
83,Long Pura, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Only just worth the three stars I gave it. The food was tasty but the consistency of the various dishes was varied, and one or two plates were just not good at all. Pity it did not live up to it's scores on G+"
84,Long Pura, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Crazy Big menu - the chef's rice table is bigger than your bigger appetite and everything is good and tasty
Nice service as well
Don't forget to reserve by internet"

91,Long Pura, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Loved the food and the people!
92,Long Pura, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful room and helpful waitstaff. But be prepared to spend a lot for so-so food. We were surprised, given the very positive reviews."
93,Long Pura, 3 stars ,4 years ago,It took us a long time to wait for a table (even though we were the only ones waiting).  Tapas style Indo food.  Tasty but food also took a long time to rlve received.  Moderately expensive.

3 stars just for the food."
98,Long Pura, 1 star ,2 years ago,terrible food. not fresh. some vegetables were tinned and the stews were poorly made. no reaction when we pointed that out. expensive and poor cocktails.
99,Long Pura, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Mass market feel with mediocre quality and blunted flavors.  As if it peaked 10 years ago and now gets by on past reputation.  Friendly, fast, forgettable.  Keep looking."
