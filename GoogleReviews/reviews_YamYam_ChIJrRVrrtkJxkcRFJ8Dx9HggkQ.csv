0,YamYam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Truly a gem. Excellent starters and top notch wood fire pizzas. Service was professional and attentive. Recommend making reservations as seating is very limited in the evening. Call ahead.
1,YamYam, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nothing special and did not listen when I said no blue cheese.. I left got pizza home only to be able to eat one third of it as I hate with a real passion blue cheese... dough was ok not great all round! Would try once more In case I got unlucky but not sure I did
2,YamYam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best Pizza out of Italy.
Great experience friendly staff nice Spritz.
Will return for the Osso-bucco"
3,YamYam, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Vegetarian pizza was different than in other places, as it had more mushrooms. This changed the taste and I really liked it. I definitely recommend this place."
4,YamYam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I've been to a few cities in Europe now and I've gotta tell you: this is the most delicious food I've had in my life. The Yam Yam pizza is fantastic!
5,YamYam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Truly excellent pizza! I tried one with ham and truffle and it was delicious, and one of the best pizzas I have even eaten. I continued with a pasta special, which was penne with lamb, and it was also faultless. Deserts were top notch. ‚Ä¶"
6,YamYam, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Just renovated, and food is still the best. Highly recomends."
7,YamYam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,As Italian I got to say this place is amazing! They are not Italians originally but they learned very well how to make pizzas and warm dishes. They have an amazing wooden oven which makes the pizza taste great. Service is fast and the ‚Ä¶
8,YamYam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizza and pasta well worth the visit - however, we thought the pasta was better than the pizza, and all was priced reasonably. Staff were welcoming, patient and polite with us. Definitely recommend making a reservation, as it gets quite busy. The fettuccine was the highlight of our food explorations in Amsterdam."
9,YamYam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,For us the best place for a tasty pizza with high quality italian's topping. You have to wait to get your pizza but you are rewarded at the first bite. Our last time was more than one year and the taste is still so great. The staff is great too. Booking is advised as the place is always crowded.
10,YamYam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the only two good pizzerias in the whole Amsterdam. Pizza really sucks in this town. Pitty they don't open earlier cos pizza is a snack, something you wanna grab and go and not really for an evening meal with candles and vine. It should be on the table, served, in three minutes, not four or more."
11,YamYam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"YamYam could rightfully claim the householdname that it is and has been for me and my family for the last 15+ years: consistent menu, super pizzas (try YamYam & Vesuvio!) and the nicest people you can find. Yesterday the owner made a personal delivery for our pizzas because of our quarantaine. We Love It!"
12,YamYam, 5 stars ,a month ago,Perfect pizza every time.
13,YamYam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very good and delicious Pizza. Try the one with the mascarpone
14,YamYam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The YamYam-pizza was better, years ago.. Today, their pizza's are closer too average. The dough is ok, but being baked too dry. On an average Margherita Pizza, they serve plain Dutch cheese, no Mozzarella. The wine is between average and ‚Ä¶"
15,YamYam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great pizza, very welcoming staff. They made us vegan pizzas, very nice. I like the place."
16,YamYam, 1 star ,a year ago,Reasonable food but lousy service - we had to wait for over 1 h to get our food while tables around us who came in much later were quickly seviced - they even forgot my wife‚Äôs plate - no excuses - the manager did not even pay attention
17,YamYam, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Enjoyed our dinner.  Did not find staff unfriendly, in fact the server made the evening better ( suggested a great manly drink).  Our pasta meal was one of the best every had."
18,YamYam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great italian spot in Amsterdam ! It's quite far from the center but easy to do by walk. I ate an incredible osso bucco : the sauce was delicious and you can choose different types of accompagnements. My friends took some pizzas which were really big and delicious as well. Correct prices and very nice staff!
19,YamYam, 4 stars ,6 years ago,The yamyam pizza is one of the best pizzas I've ever tried. The mascarpone cheese gives such a nice taste. Only one thing to improve: usually takes too long - also for take away.
20,YamYam, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"The pizzas are good, but doesn't worth  the bad service, we wait more than hour an a half  (and after we claim it) for our pizzas, no apologise from the staff. ‚Ä¶"
