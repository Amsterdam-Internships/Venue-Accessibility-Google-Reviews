0,Starbucks, 5 stars ,3 months ago,There was 2 English speakers girls who were in a really good and nice mood. The service was also very quick and the coffee was delicious. Amazing job team!
1,Starbucks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This is a nice A funny Starbucks branch since they didn‚Äôt even have a cappuccino on the menu (but you can order it üòâ) the staff was nice on a late weekend night and even the coffee was okay. The option to have some of the cookies heated is a big plus and that made the experience so much better .
2,Starbucks, 2 stars ,a month ago,Actually weird  tht that place had no toilet  . If u ask them if u have toilet they send you to mc Donald‚Äôs next door. Pffff
3,Starbucks, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Not the nicest of Starbucks. Didn't seem to be ready for checking codes.  Person taking orders was also checking codes  so took longer to order. Would have bn easier to do as u came in
4,Starbucks, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Slowest service ever. There were 4 person to serve and I had to wait almost 30 minutes. Normally in Netherlands service are slow, so no big surprise, but here it's even slowest than usual."

8,Starbucks, 1 star ,3 years ago,Due to how busy this place is - it should have a person cleaning the dining area constantly.  Also they drip coffee (tasted burnt).  For high volume they should have better quality.
9,Starbucks, 1 star ,3 months ago,Worst Starbucks ever! Pandemic going on and no alcohol for the hands. Flies all over the place and the whole place not hygienic.

15,Starbucks, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"This is the filthiest Starbucks I've seen. All the tables are dirty, even the counter where they serve the drinks had dirty dishes all over it.

16,Starbucks, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Located in a great spot.
No bathroom on site."

20,Starbucks, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Sometimes you need a taste of home. Good Starbucks, friendly and fast. Never going to be spectacular but rarely bad. Would rather go to a local coffee shop here in Amsterdam but this is a good, reliable second choice."
21,Starbucks, 4 stars ,4 years ago,one of the best place for coffee and chill out.   1star reduced because limitations in seating arrangement.
22,Starbucks, 1 star ,a year ago,"The waiter was extremely rude. I order in Dutch so there was no possible excuse. He put whipped cream in my frapuccino which i didnt order. Once i mentioned, sorry i didnt order whipped cream.he took it, removed the whiped cream fast from ‚Ä¶"
23,Starbucks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service with friendly English speaking staff. Nice and cool inside with the air con on a hot summer's day.

34,Starbucks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly staff. I ordered a iced cappuccino and didn't like it much. A very charming waiter noticed and offered to change it to something else with a smile. Clean and professional and accommodating.
35,Starbucks, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The location is good, BUT this place has NO TOILETS! And a staff member was a bit rude when asking if I wanted to order more coffee (or leave the table!). Not a good place to go with friends for a chat with coffee, or work a bit."
36,Starbucks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Warm caffee during cold evenings:)
37,Starbucks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The coffee looked weird. It was brown and very hot (burned my mouth). So strange. Had 12 more. This happened 26 hours ago, I'm still awake. Is this normal?"
38,Starbucks, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Regular Starbucks with everything you could expect on the menu.

Although they offered a free drink to apologize, which was a nice gesture."
39,Starbucks, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Crepes were fine.  Coffee Cup filled to the brim had to wait 5 mind for content to cool down before I could drink some to make space for milk...
