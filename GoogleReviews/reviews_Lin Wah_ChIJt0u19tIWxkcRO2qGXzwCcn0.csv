0,Lin Wah, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Ive been coming here with my family since I was a lot younger. The staff is always super friendly and the food is good depending on what you order. The dim Sum takes a bit longer but is worth the wait. Their specialties are also very Good.
1,Lin Wah, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very nice food and hospitality! One of the best restaurants in Almere area. Food and ambiance is worth the price. Lot of options for vegetarians as well. Highly recommended.
2,Lin Wah, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good traditional Chinese interior design. Flavors of the food are decent, but very very salty. Also the price is way too high compared to most famous Chinese restaurants in Amsterdam. Services are okay."

4,Lin Wah, 1 star ,4 years ago,"In all fairness, I do not personally eat Chinese meals. But, thought I would compare their curry to Indian curries. Result. They just do not compare. They CANNOT prepare a half decent curry. And they charge a lot more for the privilege"
