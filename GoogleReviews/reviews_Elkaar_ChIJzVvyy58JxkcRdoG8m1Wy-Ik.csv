0,Elkaar, 3 stars ,a month ago,"I love the location and the atmosphere. The food is good, but sometimes a little 80's in it's haute cuisine style (ice cream of things that aren't usually ice cream, foams, crumbles etc). It seems to me that they're not quite innovative …"

4,Elkaar, 1 star ,4 months ago,I’ve been looking forward to visit BijElkaar for a long time. The food was amazing and worthy of the Bib. The experience however was horrible. We’ve been in the restaurant from 19:00 till 23:30 (waiting on 6 courses). The time between the …

6,Elkaar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent French cuisine. Excellent price. The staff and chef were so friendly. I highly recommend this spot, you will not be dissapointed. Taste and presentation second to none.  You may want to call ahead to reserve as it is intimate in …"
7,Elkaar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,A very nice restaurant that has been awarded a Bib-Gourmand. Exceptional pricing with very attentive staff. Really enjoyed the chef's menu. There is a large terrace out front with a pleasant view. Great place to escape the otherwise crowded city center.
8,Elkaar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent small restaurant with a great chef's selection. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was casual but for special occasions. Excellent value.

11,Elkaar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A small restaurant with an exceptionally high level of cuisine and quality.  Very friendly service and a very good price-quality ratio.  The chairs are uncomfortable for men who have grown normally.

20,Elkaar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was beautifully presented, DELICIOUS & the wait staff were lovely & knowledgeable but the pace of the courses almost ruined the night. 5 hours for 5 courses is insane. I have to say though, the price to quality ratio saved the day. …"
21,Elkaar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's a very good place. With nice food and hospitality.
22,Elkaar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"High end restaurant with long explanations accompanying each dish.  Small portions but lots of courses.  Everything is tasty, although a few dishes were a bit too subtle or small for me to appreciate in proportion to the explanation.  Still, I enjoyed it.  Good wine selection, exemplary service."
23,Elkaar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Recently we bought a 4 course meal to eat at home - both veggie and non-veggie. The starters and desserts were beautifully presented in separate containers - although cycling home didn't help the presentation. The bread and cheese courses …

27,Elkaar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Booked for two and mentioned it was for an anniversary meal. They reserved us the best seat in the house and made it that extra bit special for us. Food was beyond superb and so was the wine pairing. The staff was lovely, and we honestly …"

29,Elkaar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,On our first night in ams we arrived from our nearby hotel only 30 minutes before closing.

Wonderful!
30,Elkaar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This small but cosy restaurant is housed in a charming old building. It is one of the 15 restaurants in Amsterdam that has a very well deserved Bib gourmand. The service was good and the food (steak tartare/tuna, venison/wild boar, …"
31,Elkaar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed by the hostess. The friendly hostess got our coats and we sat down on a table for three people. We were asked if we wanted to start off with an apéritif, and of course, how …"

34,Elkaar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"As a local we enjoyed Elkaar. Food is usually perfect (risotto, duck, lamb ...) serving efficient, family style. Wine selection is good for the price range.
I can not forget the "" mango lasagne"" desert."

45,Elkaar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Just ok. If it's raining and everyone has to sit inside it becomes rather stuffy.  I can't really say it was worth the price.
