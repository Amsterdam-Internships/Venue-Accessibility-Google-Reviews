0,Tokoman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Yummy!!! Great empanadas!!! the food is fresh they put  your box in the microwave to warm up it!!!
Great customer service!!!"
1,Tokoman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The taste is amazing!!!!!
I ate a box with fried rice, beans and fish. I can defently recommend it. The price especially for this area is super! Definitely a must for good food in the red light zone"
2,Tokoman, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The experience wasn‚Äôt great. If you prefer veggie food - then you have to be ready to have frozen vegetables baked in microwave oven: they don‚Äôt even precook it before, that is why noodles will be overheated, vegetables will be cold. Finally the price isn‚Äôt low for this service. My First and the last time to eat here"
3,Tokoman, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food and a very large selection
4,Tokoman, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The ordered Tjau Min Moksi Meti (aka.  Stirred fried noodles with mixed meat) is not the authentic Surinamese Chinese  Tjau Min with BBQ pork (tjar sui), crispy fried chicken and  fa chong sausage. The food was tasty, somewhat to sweet to ‚Ä¶"
5,Tokoman, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful service, a waste of ‚Ç¨7.50 (for my menu options). I got the meat wok box with barbeque chicken, thick noodles and the mushroom/broccoli mix. The pick and mix is microwaved to heat it up, which is unappetizing. The meat and ‚Ä¶"
6,Tokoman, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Seems touristy, but it's actually tasty. The prices were also more than reasonable! The only minus for me was the attitude of the people working there. Not the friendliest, especially if you ask any question instead of just ordering right ‚Ä¶"
7,Tokoman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"You get what you pay for- quite a descent size of noodles/rice for a very good price.
A pity you can only add one type of veggie, when you order the non-vegetarian option, but still very good."
8,Tokoman, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I do not understand how people are upset about a microwave ?!

This shop offers 30 or 40 different dishes! How should they keep them warm ? ‚Ä¶"
9,Tokoman, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious and aromatic food. Good portions. We absolutely loved this place. We came here multiple times :)
10,Tokoman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best take away Amsterdam: super value for 7,50; delicious tasty; so much choices; and last but not least top customer service!
Weekly customer Hans."
11,Tokoman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food is great its like a fusion on Chinese/Carribbean. Hou have your traditional chinese dishes and you have. Some staple Carribean food like roti which is made similar to the way Guyanese people make it. I cant fault the food one bit it was some of the best food i had in dam. I went there twice
12,Tokoman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super nice place, Tilly food and veggy options too. Clean and tidy. Prices are very decent and you can sit if there's space (but there's only a bar) perfect place to stop and eat."
13,Tokoman, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Possibly the best fast food I've had.... EVER. I had their beef pastry and my friend has the beef black bean noodles. Awesome quality food and beautiful flavour. PLEASE OPEN IN LONDON.

23,Tokoman, 1 star ,a year ago,terrible roti. Not real Surinam stuff. It's just too dry and too salty.
