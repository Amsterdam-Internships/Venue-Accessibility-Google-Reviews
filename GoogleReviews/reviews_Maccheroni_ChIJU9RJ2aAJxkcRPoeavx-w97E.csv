0,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Regularly order pizza from here, never had a bad one, best pizza in Amsterdam, in my opinion. Not eaten many of their pasta dishes but vegetarians need to try their pumpkin ravioli with sage butter, amazing. Their desserts are good but the ‚Ä¶"
1,Maccheroni, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We asked for dinner at Maccheroni in Amsterdam at 20:20, the app showed around 30 min estimated delivery time, but just after that it showed 1 hour. 10 minutes after the end of the delivery time we needed to call to the restaurant because ‚Ä¶"
2,Maccheroni, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The carbonara pasta was enormousüò± It was delivered warm and was well packed.  The taste was not the best I tried but for sure I will give this restaurant another chance. The portion is big for this price.
3,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Eating in the restaurant was great! Great service like no where in Amsterdam really! Good food friendly service, fast, no whining because you ask for different / separated bills! Wonderful experience me and my friends totally recommend it! Will come here as often as we can! üòÅüëåüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,Maccheroni, 1 star ,a month ago,Worst food I have ever ordered
5,Maccheroni, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horror. This is might be a representation of the worst on Italian stereotypes. The gentlemen doing delivery with the scooters would definitely fit into the traffic in Naples. They definitely do not fit in Amsterdam.

20,Maccheroni, 1 star ,2 years ago,Late and untruthful.
21,Maccheroni, 1 star ,11 months ago,"(Translated by Google) Terrible Experience! Never helped so badly. Never delivery of the pizzas. The pizzeria claimed that the delivery person did not have a ""delivery bag"", then the pizzas would have been given to another delivery person. ‚Ä¶"
22,Maccheroni, 1 star ,11 months ago,"(Translated by Google) In the beginning, it was great! We just received a pizza that had not yet been put in the oven, so it has not yet been baked. I call and report this. I was asked to give this to the delivery person and would receive a ‚Ä¶"
23,Maccheroni, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"(Translated by Google) Eaten reasonably. Had the gnocchi in tomato cheese sauce. Tasty in itself, but way too salty. You gotta love such a salty taste due to the large amount of cheese (and extra salt?). I also found 14 euros for a dish ‚Ä¶"
24,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,a year ago,(Translated by Google) First time we had food from Maccheroni delivered. Really unbelievably good food. You can taste that the food has been made with love and attention. Everything is neatly packaged and the extras you get are more than ‚Ä¶
25,Maccheroni, 1 star ,11 months ago,"(Translated by Google) An extra hour than indicated delivery time waited for the delivery, then the delivery at 2100 is canceled and we are without food. Maccheroni has not sought a solution, pizzas have never been delivered. ‚Ä¶"
26,Maccheroni, 1 star ,a year ago,"(Translated by Google) Really the worst pasta I've ever eaten. We had pasta carbonara and a pasta bolognese, which are really not difficult dishes to make but this was very badly done. The sauces tasted like they came from a can. In ‚Ä¶"
27,Maccheroni, 2 stars ,a year ago,"(Translated by Google) Ordered chicken legs and pizza, including delivery 27 euros. Chicken legs were soft and did not taste much, a bit slimy. Pizza was average, not bad but certainly not worth 16 euros. Price performance is too far apart. ‚Ä¶"
28,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,a year ago,"(Translated by Google) Delicious food and fast (friendly) delivery. Pastas both well flavored and generous portions - I will definitely order the pasta with broccoli and chicken again. Thought I ran out of room for dessert, but this ‚Ä¶"
29,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,a year ago,"(Translated by Google) Delicious pizzas, practically consistent quality.
Unfortunately it went wrong once in terms of delivery, but the way they dealt with this is an example for other companies: you are listened to and a solution is ‚Ä¶"
30,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Italian specialties prepared and cooked with love.
For the 2nd time in a row we have sent Maccheroni a ""special request"" to provide delicious birthday snacks. Giovanni and Marleen went for ""The Extra Mile"" ‚Ä¶"
31,Maccheroni, 1 star ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Used to be good, but now the ghost is out of the bottle. Normally I have them delivered, but when I was around I went to pick it up. No tables, just a zipper of computers and iPads to handle the orders. In addition, ‚Ä¶"
32,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) 2 pizzas ordered, calzone and a pizza with salami. Unfortunately Calzone was not to your liking. But with a phone call, a suitable solution was offered. Another pizza and as a surprise we got 2 beers for the ‚Ä¶"
33,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,4 years ago,(Translated by Google) We regularly order from Maccheroni and are always very satisfied. Fine flavors and fresh ingredients! It tastes like it was made with a lot of love. They just delivered food to us in the Tosara garden and I really ‚Ä¶
34,Maccheroni, 1 star ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) For the 2x pizza ordered with seas of oil. With the 2x quickly returned and the payment recovered. Was there just in time, before 10 p.m. Got nasty comments from the outside workers hurled over my head. ‚Ä¶"
35,Maccheroni, 5 stars ,a year ago,(Translated by Google) yesterday picked up 2 pizzas DELICIOUS !!! friendly employees and well read the comments thank you Maccheroni I will see you again !!! ‚Ä¶
36,Maccheroni, 1 star ,4 years ago,(Translated by Google) This shop is really too skimpy for words. Food is at the very least prepared with apparently the intention to fool the customer. Very little tomato salsa and cheese. Toppings of non-artisan quality while artisan ‚Ä¶
37,Maccheroni, 1 star ,4 years ago,(Translated by Google) Worst pizzeria in Amsterdam. Ingredients are minimal and of noticeably low quality. Salami is bone-dry cervelat. Doesn't look like anything. And then quite high prices. ‚Ä¶
