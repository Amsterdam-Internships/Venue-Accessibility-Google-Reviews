7,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,One of the only bars in Amsterdam that you can smoke only canabis and you can also have an alcoholic cocktail. It would be nice if they had drink specials like happy hour or half off cocktails for the customers from the coffeshop across the street.

41,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It was a nice place except for the waitress (the one with glasses) that made fun of us because we had our suitcases and we were sitting on the same side of the table. She was laughing and talking shot about us (speaking loudly so that everyone could hear her). Awful service, very rude waiters. I will never go there again."
42,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hard working and friendly staff, the atmosphere there is lovely. Best coffee I have ever had and got some quality rolling papers from them too. No tobacco which is very nice, makes the air breathable. 100% will come back"

49,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The mood is good but the food is not. The fish n chips tough I don't recommend maybe some dishes are better. The staff gave us our food after making us wait like 30 min. Then they don't gave us either water, forks and knives, or tissues ."
50,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beef burger with blue-vein cheese was delicious, forever etched in my memory.

51,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Amazing products and friendly staff
52,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"For some reason the place was exceptionally warm.  Made it so we didnt want to stick around.  The food was nice, the service was slow and rather uncoordinated.  Price was a bit high for a 5oz burger and fries @ 12.50 ‚Ç¨. If you smoke this is the place for you.  If you dont.  Leave it be."

54,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Hadn‚Äôt been here for over a year, it‚Äôs gone so downhill- they rush you constantly, the food and drink is even more overpriced and to top it off the portions are now tiny! ‚Ä¶"

56,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is nice having a bar like this one where you can also eat quality food and smoke weed while drinking your beer. Also, the staff is very sympathetic and the environment is peaceful. Great bar, would recommend it üëå"
57,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was very good. I had the BLT, which even though in my opinion expensive (12,-), was delicious. Deducting a star because it took long for the food to come. Waiters were fast, ample food an drink options available."
58,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really great place! This is a 'coffeeshop' so everyone is allowed to smoke weed here freely. Lighters, papers and filters are available. ‚Ä¶"
59,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Friendly and trendy alternative to enjoying Amsterdam's coffeeshops, this bar is ""smoker"" friendly though tobacco is not tolerated. It has a wide range of beers and spirits and some amazing food... Their apple pie was so good we had to come ‚Ä¶"

63,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Very nice food, very friendly staff and cozy atmosphere üëå"
64,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite coffeeshops. Great food and atmosphere. Nice place to get out of the crowds and relax. Smoke all the cannabis you want but no tobacco. Which isn't a problem. Eat breaakfast and  have a smoke. Friendly staff. A+++
65,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely not the friendliest of staff, would not recommend for vegetarians the veggie burger for example is just your cheap average freezer veggie patty in a bun with salad and pretty dry. Coffee is okay but nothing special"
66,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Could not have asked for more.  These guys are perfect.

The garden burger was awesome but those fries!!! Amazing, so good we went back ‚Ä¶"
67,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Came to Barney's on two seperate occasions on one of our trips to Amsterdam, first we came to this place as a change from our usual Coffeeshop (as we wanted dinner too), and ended up having the best burger and chips ever - it's been a year ‚Ä¶"
68,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Well worth visiting if the main coffeeshop is busy, has a cosy vibe, friendly staff. You can drink alcohol and smoke cannabis here (no cigarettes). I didn't try the food, but the breakfast looked good."
69,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Waitress was so inattentive! We sat down, she gave us some menus and said ""what do you want to drink?"" and we asked her for a minute, then she never came back. She served the couple next to us their food, and by the time they had finished ‚Ä¶"
70,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Service needs improvement. The place was unstaffed.
71,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a really nice bar that serves food and let's you smoke as well! The food is great, friendly staff and has a very chilled out atmosphere. This place is a must visit if your looking for drinks, food and somwhere to smoke."

73,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We have visited more than 10 smokers friendly places in amsterdam last week and this place winning the 1st award, no doubts. friendly staff and good quality service, interesting menu, alcohol allowed as well as jonts. you can prurchase some extra equipment in the shop on the opposite side of the street. kind regards"
74,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It‚Äôs a bar that serves food and allows weed to be smoked on the premises. It‚Äôs fine as weed friendly bars go. Clean. Good music policy. Nice staff.
75,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such a great solution to the somewhat convoluted laws in Amsterdam. It's a smoking friendly bar so you can have a drink and smoke if you bring your own. And if you run out of smoke that's fine because Barney's coffeeshop is just on the other side of the street
76,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's my first stop as I get into town. Just a chill atmosphere where I can eat, drink and relax with friends or alone and they have a banging milkshake and burgers and everything!"
77,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Shocking experience . Staff did not even acknowledge we walked in. Waited at the bar staring at 3 waiters still not even a hello. I sarcastically said ""hello how's your day going ? Great? Can we geta table?"" They finally got one together. ‚Ä¶"
78,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing burgers and friendly staff! We accidentally sat at a reserved table for 12 (it was just the two of us and we have no idea where to sit) one waiter kindly instructed us to the table and that‚Äôs when we had one of the best burgers ever!
79,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wife left her newly purchased fabrics in a bag here.  Hours later we marched back and found the bartenders had put it in a safe place.  Happy reunion.
80,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,Incredibly friendly staff and service. They indeed give you very positive and friendly experience (not only food and drinks)
81,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Barneys farm is one of my fav place to go , not the shop where you get the greens but the bar and the little coffe place at the corner. it's nice and bright, the bartender was very friendly and made me enjoy my high even more ."
82,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Best coffeeshop I visited in Amsterdam, it has volcano vaporizers on every table (which are worth ‚Ç¨500) that you can use for free as long as you buy some weed. Nice atmosphere, good service and a great time."
83,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This review is for the other Barney's across the street(which isn't on Google Maps unfortunately). ‚Ä¶

The italian girl working here, Carola, was great: she immeditially make me feel at home.
Great!"
86,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place to take a break from the crowds of Amsterdam. Very friendly staff and every night a new DJ who brought his own style of music. Would recommend and go again.
87,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,8 months ago,A lovely place with great staff. At the Coffee shop you have Tomas and at the Cafe you have Lawrence. Two upbeat full of energy people who will make sure you enjoy your time at Barney
88,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Why does this place insist on cramming people into the smallest tables on one side of the place when a entire row of tables on the other side sits empty. Every time I'm here. I really don't get it. How about some customer service and ‚Ä¶
89,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love this place. Great beer. Good company. Pleasant environment. Almost due for an upgrade though if it wants to maintain its position in 1st place.
90,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 1 star ,6 years ago,Bought 2 pre rolled j's and both got me no buzz 0%. Total ripoff.  Bought 2-3 other grams and i basically ended up giving it away. Like no taste. And mainly no buzz. I suspect most reviews are from euros and stuff. But if your american and ‚Ä¶

95,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,As a resident of the Jordaan .. it was a decent bar to be in  .. as a non drinker most of the time I didn't use it much .. but when I did with visitors it was a fine place
96,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best places to get breakfast if you're looking for a chilled morning. Just a heads up they allow you to smoke inside so it might not be everyone's cup of tea.
97,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favourite coffee shops in centraal Amsterdam. And vaporizers on every table in the main coffee shop across the road.
Steaks are amazing.
And the milkshakes"
98,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing place.  Smoker friendly and a very chilled vibe. Great if you want space from people as a lot of places you can smoke tend to be rather ""cosy""."
99,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great vibe, not overly packed. You can smoke weed and enjoy bar service. Solid music and dj. Prices are very reasonable."
100,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"the irish breakfast made up for the over priced weed across the road. barneys uptown is a nice environment to smoke. and, you can take all the weed you want from better shops around amsterdam and get left to yourself. just avoid the place if the girl emily is working. she is racist and rude."
101,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"This place is close to dampkring, and let me

103,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"love this place...sometimes during the day it can be too touristy but in the evenings it is more relaxed... definitely a place where you can smoke, relax, order a wide variety of food, drinks, snacks and just hang out...go if you are in the neighborhood"
104,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Horrible service. At first it was great although crowded. But we got our drinks. After we were done we ordered food and it Took forever! Although it wasn‚Äôt crowded!
105,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cannabis-friendly bar/restaurant - not cheap, but smoking-permitted places with actual table service, actual food, surprisingly good cocktails aren't exactly common, so totally worth it. Barney's Coffeeshop is basically just across the street."
106,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Small place with a friendly atmosphere. Burgers are good if a little pricey, beer selection is good, and they are smoking friendly (non-tobacco)."
107,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Got recommended this place by my friends that were with me when I went to Amsterdam and have to say a great wee place to go if you like different kinds of smokes and different strains at a good price

112,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 1 star ,6 years ago,"First of all I would like to start by saying, I am not new to Amsterdam or the CoffeeShop Culture, I have been going to Barneys Coffeeshop since 2012 and every year I visit, gets more expensive and the quality has gone down. We got some of ‚Ä¶"
113,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"If you have the ‚Äúluck‚Äù to meet Kevin (or if unfortunately he‚Äôs on duty), YOU BETTER RUN AWAY! This guy should never be ‚Äúserving‚Äù customers.

115,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Decent food and location, especially if you want a pint or some munchies to go along with you're greens. Service is a bit scatty though."

133,Barney's Uptown Amsterdam, 1 star ,3 years ago,The owner likes to ventilate his anger to his personel in front of the customers. Quite freaky. I`ve seen him flip out on different occasions. Prices are insane.
