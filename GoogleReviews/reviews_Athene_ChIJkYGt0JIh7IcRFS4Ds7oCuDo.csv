1,Athene, 1 star ,a month ago,"Right now I cannot recommend Athene for any services.  I waited 40 minutes just to get to a rep, then was on the phone 2 hours but they could not help me get into my account.  I was promised a call back that I NEVER received.  When an …"
2,Athene, 1 star ,a month ago,If I could give 0 stars I would. Hold times when calling in for questions is awful having waited on hold 3 separate times for a minimum of 30 minutes and as much as 40 minutes each time. Call back from a supervisor was non-existant even …
3,Athene, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,Athene has stopped my annuity payments without explanation and only started them (with back payments) after I inquired into what was going on.  Tax 1099's seem to have incorrect totals and wrong states listed for state tax.  Athene is slow to answer inquiries.
4,Athene, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Nikki was awesome and professional, she was able to accommodate my request and explained the waiting period and in the future being able to complete the task online to avoid calling."
5,Athene, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Value of annuity went down after the market went up 7,000 points in a 2 year period.  The agents who sold me the annuity used the words ""ZERO IS HERO"" and said the value of my annuities would NEVER go down.  A sales pitch and not one bit truthful.  I moved two of my annuities to Allianz.  Do not trust Athene."
6,Athene, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Athene is the best product for someone wanting to grow their funds.  I simply love the Athene Performance Elite 7.  If you like having your principal protected, and having a great opportunity for growth; this is the company and product to put your trust in."

15,Athene, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Dakota from the home office was exceptional in all respects.

I highly recommend Athene as a company and it's commitment to excellence."

17,Athene, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great company for annuities. I’m very happy that I found them.
As a retired federal government supervisor and navy veteran with over 34 years in the federal government I’m  much more happier with the choices and options offered with Athene over if I had left my money in the federal Thrift Savings Plan."
18,Athene, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I chose to put funds into Athene annuities.   I strongly recommend anyone check into the topic of annuities before making this choice, but it has worked well for me (my circumstances, risk tolerance/avoidance, etc.) Now retired for close to …"

21,Athene, 1 star ,a year ago,"Bad experience, took almost 3 months to cash out annuity. Here are the facts: They do everything by snail mail. Send in packet, theirs a minor problem with it, they snail mail a letter back instead of calling or emailing. Letter never …"
22,Athene, 5 stars ,a year ago,"No losses in the stock market and free withdrawal! Much much better that an old 401K!
I used the online service, but in the past great customer service. They answered all my questions including how to fill out forms. But online is faster."
23,Athene, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If I could, I would give this review a zero. Due to an upcoming medical procedure, I asked if they could close out an IRA and waive the usurious 12% withdrawal penalty and close it out with a check that takes out only federal and state …"
24,Athene, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The bad reviews of this company are most likely written by

27,Athene, 1 star ,2 years ago,Ok.  Hoping this saves someone and keeps some money from going into Athene’s CEO’s pocket.  The bad reviews are correct.  Had a life insurance policy for 10 years.  Same payment for ten years.  They notified me once the 10 years was up that …

31,Athene, 2 stars ,a year ago,"It's hard to reach a customer service rep who can do more than tell you  to talk to or send something to another department.  And if they can't open a file you submit, no one contacts you so you can do something different.  Every time we make a withdrawal, it's a 2-3 week hassle even thought you're supposed to be able to do it online."
32,Athene, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been with Athene for about 3 years.
Bought one annuity with them for about $10,000.

44,Athene, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Athene is not customer oriented. If you decide to take a monthly withdrawal, you get the wrong forms. They do not call to tell you. One and a half weeks later you get a letter telling you this. You have to ask for a new form, fill it out …"

58,Athene, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"For those considering an annuity, there are many to choose from. However they should take a hard look at Athene's high quality policy designs. For the most part, I find them to be ""beyond"" excellent."
59,Athene, 1 star ,4 years ago,I cancelled my policy during the free review period. That was weeks ago. They are still holding my funds. They make up reasons not to transfer my funds to my account and delay the process. Not a good business. They need to be reported. My next task.

100,Athene, 1 star ,5 years ago,Life insurance with this company is very risky. They sale your policy to other companies and take no responsibility in reporting your holdings and provide no customer service when the new company refuses to provide reports.
