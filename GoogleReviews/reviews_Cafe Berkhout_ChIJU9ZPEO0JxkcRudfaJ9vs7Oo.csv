0,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was a great little bar to stop by just outside of the Heineken factory. The pizza far exceeded my expectations for just a quick bite. Drink and food selection was pretty good. I recommend doing the extra cold Heineken. The servers/bartenders were friendly, and quick to anything you needed. Recommend!"

2,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I was recommended this place by another tourist and I decided to check it out and it was worth it. Their bitterballs (which I was told to specifically try) were delicious. They are very hot as well so be careful. The server was absolutely joy to talk to, very warm and welcoming."
3,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent place to have lunch. Located next to a very busy intersection near Heineken brewery. With large windows that provides a great entertainment to look out while having food. The food is of top quality. We had the teriyaki chicken ‚Ä¶
4,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I grab a quick bite with my girlfriend and it was really good. The staff is kind and the environment remember the irish pub (without the live performance, of course). The food was really tasty and not that expensive. The chips/fries are a must in here"
5,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,3 years ago,First time having Heineken in Amsterdam and it was smooth...also tried a beer that‚Äôs made by Heineken called Zwaar Blond which I recommend as well...I was here on a Sunday night at about 9pm and it was pretty empty...so if you‚Äôre looking ‚Ä¶

7,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We‚Äôve been coming to this places few days for the last month and we really like it. Good music and atmosphere. Probably our favourite caf√© in Amsterdam.
8,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,10 months ago,I went to this cafe and restaurant two times in one day. Morning I went there and have a good cappuccino the. Visit vangogh and Rijksmuseum then afternoon we had lunch there which was absolutely perfect. It is in front of Heineken museum ‚Ä¶

16,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stayed in Amsterdam a week and came here three times. Once for a delicious breakfast and twice in the evening for a casual beer. The staff are super friendly and it's really a very nice place to pop in for something quick. Very quiet in the evenings so great place to chill and talk.
17,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Surprising find for breakfast - went to it as the queue for its popular neighbour, B&R, was frankly quite frightening considering our hunger at that point in time. ‚Ä¶"
18,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We stopped in for a quick bite after a late Heineken factory tour (and the two beers afterward!) and were blown away.  The waiter was very friendly and attentive despite the late hour and the food (tuna melt and open-face hummus sandwich) was fantastic.  Great ending to a wonderful day!
19,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a really great bar for anyone to visit, any time.  Really comfortable, great service, just the kind of place you are looking for when you travel: a big old brown wood bar, brown wood floor, some wood paneling on the walls, and some ‚Ä¶"
20,Cafe Berkhout, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Probably my own fault for ordering nachos at a Dutch cafe, but they were not great. They gave us Thai chili sauce instead of salsa, which was weird. Other than the lackluster nachos, the bar has a great, cozy vibe and the beer is excellent."
21,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Good.
22,Cafe Berkhout, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We stopped in for dinner and drinks after a long day of sight seeing. We requested tap water with our dinner and beers and were refused. They flat out lied and told us it was against the law. Food was good, but beware of this place."

24,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely little place, good and friendly service. Also ive seen this beautiful girl, sitting with her grandmom,, as i walked out to go on a heiniken tour we shared a look and a smile, she had big beautiful eyes, short hair and a hipster style.

28,Cafe Berkhout, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved the meatballs, unique taste."
29,Cafe Berkhout, 1 star ,4 years ago,How can you possibly rate this place with 4.4 stars? 45 mins for 2 burgers? A disappearing waiter? 20 minutes to get somebody to settle the check? Caf√© Bad seems like a better name.
30,Cafe Berkhout, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Very nice place. A little bit noisy but the atmosphere inside makes it very cosy. Drinks are decent and the food selection is pretty big. From sandwiches to burgers and more. Enjoy!

32,Cafe Berkhout, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food was good but the waitress was very very rude. Why would she work if she is so indifferent and lazy and has a bad attitude. She has a problem.
