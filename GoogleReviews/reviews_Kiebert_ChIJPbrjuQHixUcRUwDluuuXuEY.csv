0,Kiebert, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Cosy place with great staff. The cheese cake is a must eat. There is sufficient room and privacy to work and read without being constanly disturbed by people movement or sound. The music selection was varied and pleasant.

4,Kiebert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing place with home atmosphere. Huge windows make it bright and spacious. Food is healthy and fresh. View on the canal makes it feel authentically Amsterdam-ish. Nice to come any time of the day.
5,Kiebert, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice terrace, slowest service ever - and food was not even interesting.
I ordered a toast... which in a funny plot twist, didn't have bread. After raising the issue to the waiters they brought it, separated. …"

Definitely bookmarked for the future."
7,Kiebert, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Coffee nice but the tuna melt and pulled chicken was very very dry...you know when you have to take a drink to help it go down 😭🤔 stingy portion size also. Service as expected, below average...may as well be self service"
