0,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"I tried Ter Marsch & Co 4 years ago in Rotterdam and it was the best burger I had, so when I came to Amsterdam I had to visit again. Their concept in Amsterdam is so colorful and funü§© Service was a bit slow due to crowdedness, but they ‚Ä¶"
1,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Absolutely incredible experience! The Ter Marsch classic is straight up THE BEST burger I have ever tasted and the fries topped with slow cooked pulled pork were to DIE for! ü§§ and as the cherry on top the restaurant's style, ambience and even music were fantastic üòç Could not recommend more!"
2,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The service was good, fast and super friendly. The burgers are delicious and high quality. The price is a good deal for Amsterdam area for such quality. The restaurant atmosphere is very cool and festive. It's perfect to have dinner with a cocktailüç∏"
3,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of the best burger in town. I cannot say it‚Äôs the best coz I didn‚Äôt try many in Ams. But it is really delicious. The place has a variety of meats and burgers recipes. ‚Ä¶
4,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Honestly, the best service we‚Äôve had in Europe EVER! The gentleman (who is studying hospitality) was truly wonderful. Also the food was incredible! Highly recommend the pulled pork fries. But wow one more quick shout out to the spectacular ‚Ä¶"
5,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The food is absolutely delicious and the snacks are amazing too (must-try Bitterballen and highly recommend Buikspek). The restaurant also offers drinks so it‚Äôs a perfect destination for a night out. Our server was very nice and the chef too. Will comeback later!
6,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Absolutely lovely place to dine in Amsterdam. With original dishes and the staff is just perfect. They all give off alot of positive energy and seem to really enjoy working there which makes eating there even more pleasant. Do know that the ‚Ä¶

9,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,a month ago,We did have to wait a while for our food but it was amazing! The cocktail bar also looked quite nice and they know what they are doing. Good sweet potatie fries as well.
10,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I‚Äôm speak less about how this chefs improves quality and think up to new burgers very nice also the cocktails are high quality thank you termars&co team to this wonderfull experience

12,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"One of the best places to eat burgers I have ever been to, especially for young people. The burgers were delicious, the staff was very friendly. In addition to this I enjoyed the music in the restaurant. The atmosphere was great. I would come there one more time for sure."
13,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,a month ago,A nice friendly place.  The service is good and the music here is nice.
14,Ter Marche & Co, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We made it around 6 pm, the place was already crowded.
So we sat a the bar for a drink before having dinner, then a table is finally available. ‚Ä¶"
15,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Burger I have ever had.
I was craving a burger when my sister and I arrived in Amsterdam and after searching Google maps I decided on this place because I liked the decor. So we walked ‚Ä¶"
16,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great ambience, great beer (crazy daisy) and guys burger is incomplete without fries."
17,Ter Marche & Co, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Disappointing...clearly a very popular place, but definitely not due to the service. Maybe it was just because it's Saturday? Felt like they knew that if we got up and left they'd have someone else through the door to fill the seat pretty quickly...so why bother with good service? At least the burgers were decent."
18,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Really friendly staff and very nice atmosphere. I would definitely go back.
19,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Oh man. This was one of the first spots we went to eat at during our trip to AMS. The staff helped us out and were so attentive from the minute we sat down. There wasn‚Äôt any tables at first but they sat us by the bar and offered drinks ‚Ä¶
20,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,6 months ago,One of the best burger i ate in my whole life. The gins tonics are good too. But the most appreciable thing is that the waiter forgot to count 6 cocktails when he gaves us the bill. Go there asap to eat a wonderful burger and pray to have the amnesic waiter if you drink a lot.
21,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice place and atmosphere in a busy street and touristic atmosphere.
I tried ""De Burgeresse"" it was tasty and fresh but I had higher expectations. The fries were also good. Price is normal for Amsterdam.The staff were very friendly."
22,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fries have been amazing. I didn't like the Asian Burger of the year 2020. But the other one I ordered was super amazing. Ribs have been the weak spot of my menu. Looked nice but not soft and juicy enough
23,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Yesterday my friend and I had lunch at Ter Marsch & Co in Amsterdam. I know them from Rotterdam, where they also have an amazinglocation! Our lunch in Amsterdam was very delicious, we tasted their award winning burger called ""The Gojira"" ‚Ä¶"
24,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"A very atmospheric place to have a cocktail with 2 at the bar. The menu includes 5 very original cocktails. The 2 we had chosen (a rum cocktail with chocolate ""no milk shake"" and the gin-tonic ""50 shades or red"") were of high quality. You ‚Ä¶"
25,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The burger was pretty good. And really was the only thing giving 3 stars. We waited pretty long for service and drinks. I'm giving one extra star because of the waiter behind the bar that saw us waiting and took the order. Would I come again? Maybe. But I would say it's a place to try.
26,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A bit of a long wait but for once it's the truth when a venue says 'best burger in'. One of the best in the world even! This was a legendary burger with an extremely juicy and well seasoned patty. Amazing brioche bun. Perfect construction. Pickled cucumber, right amount of sauce. Pancetta instead of bacon, classic flavors but different!"
27,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I had the cheese burger, the wife had the classic.  Neither burger was really built for eating with your hands.  Too tall, too thick with toppings, the bun a little too crispy .  But... ‚Ä¶"
28,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Just, wow. Burger was crazy good and the Caesar salad was also fantastic. Probably in my top 3 burgers."
29,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Unlike others here, I experienced very fast service, on Friday evening no less. Friendly too. I won't rave about the burger I ate. I was looking forward to trying this Japanese beef everyone is going on about. But the burger was so ‚Ä¶"
30,Ter Marche & Co, 1 star ,6 months ago,The service sucks. We wanted to order something and the waitress told us she was very busy and needs to help something in the kitchen. We actually already decided what to order and it would take only 1 minute. If it is something urgent in ‚Ä¶
31,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We came here because we have read and heard about the prizes that they have received for their burgers and man... They totally deserve them!! I would say definitely best burgers I've had so far in Amsterdam ! And we've been around some ‚Ä¶
32,Ter Marche & Co, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Expect poor service.  Restuarant was not busy yet we waited 10min  to be seated.  We were blatantly ignored by staff who talked amongst themselves at the bar.   Eventually someone  sauntered to us and made us feel like an inconvenience , so much so that we felt uncomfortable and left."
33,Ter Marche & Co, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I asked the waiter to exclude the onion from my burger, but I had the onion in my burger üôÉ The place is good, tasty beer, romantic atmosphere üôåüèº"
34,Ter Marche & Co, 3 stars ,5 months ago,For a place claiming ‚ÄûBest Burgers in NL 2020‚Äú really disappointing‚Ä¶patty was super rare (and I am saying that although I usually eat my beed relatively rare‚Ä¶) and overall the food was underwhelming.
35,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"One of the best burger places in Amsterdam, great location too. The cocktails could be better though."
36,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great burgers, friendly staff and reasonable prices. Highly recommended."
37,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Colorful vibrant place with very nice music and crowd! The service alone is truly worth the visit; staff is always with a smile and eager to help in any way. Congratulations!
38,Ter Marche & Co, 2 stars ,a week ago,Just a pretty place but food is definitely not a good trait here. Disappointed unfortunately :(
39,Ter Marche & Co, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Absolutely horrible staff , two blond girls both completely ignored us because we were tourists and proceeded to serve everyone around us who had come in after , was very excited to try the food as it sounded lovely but we never got served so had to leave , would never come here again , if you‚Äôre a tourist skip it"
40,Ter Marche & Co, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Very nice food. However, my boyfriend is allergic to nuts and despite the burger having no nuts listed on the menu, he realised halfway through when he bit into a walnut that in fact it did have nuts. He was sick three times. The waiters, ‚Ä¶"

42,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Some of the best burgers in the city, a bit pricey but great vibes and proper messy burgers"
43,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Chill place with good music, the working atmosphere seem great and good burgers too! The Royal Dutch are one of the burgers that is amazing."
44,Ter Marche & Co, 3 stars ,7 months ago,The place is very nice. Service was good too and waiters very kind. However the burgers were advertised as ‚Äúbest of 2020‚Äù for example. It was good but not amazing at all. I‚Äôve had much better ones
45,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Found this food treasure in Amsterdam! Mouth-watering burgers & fries, amazing cocktails & superb ambience.Staff was super friendly. This is now one of my favourate place to dine and hangout with my friends."
46,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best burgers of my life! The Angus + Wagyu meat is amazing and cooked to perfection. Plus nice sauce and veggies and bun! They also have a nice Amsterdam craft beer. I totally recommand this restaurant.
47,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Good burgers and fries, it might take a bit longer to get your order when it‚Äôs busy but it‚Äôs worth it"
48,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great restaurant, when they say they have the best burgers the mean it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
49,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic burgers and a good selection of beers. Not particularly cheap and you have to buy your sides in addition to your burger.
50,Ter Marche & Co, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Burger meat was raw the first time and half raw the second time. Maybe it's how they like it in NL. The bacon was also raw and it was oozing too much mayonnaise. NOT the best burger in Amsterdam.
51,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Amazing place, inexpensive, and a very nice aesthetic"
52,Ter Marche & Co, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Tried ""The Royal Dutch¬†"" burger. Was not what i expected with such high rating. The beef was not hot and no suprise with the sauce. The fries with garlic sauce and the lemonade was good. Average to about ¬£24 spending per person."
53,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"So far for me the best burger in Amsterdam. Choose the De Burgeresse, its their best one. I ordered one burger and split it in two, to share together, with a side dish of fries with truffel mayonaise and grilled asparagus salade."
54,Ter Marche & Co, 1 star ,4 years ago,Terrible and rude staff. At 7.30pm at the end of the flower market we tried to sit in one of the two apparently free tables at the entrance. We were sent away 'These tables are reserved. There are plenty of places in Rembrandtplein where ‚Ä¶
55,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great drinks and food, service was very good and friendly. Nice chilled location with food music and seating outside."
56,Ter Marche & Co, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We tried the ""best burger in the Netherlands"". It's peculiar, but very expensive and somewhat unsatisfactory for that price.
The fries were not so good, I had better ones in the Netherlands.
On the other hand, the staff was really nice and the place is really cool."
57,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The decoration is just so nice & cute, the atmosphere gives you a lovely feeling.
The staff was very friendly as well, loved the suggested cocktail by the waiter. The Veggie Burger was tasty!"
58,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best burgers in town. Perfectly grilled (medium rare) and the toppings are well balanced. Even my French co workers liked it. ‚Ä¶
59,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I did not know a burger can taste this good.
60,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, very good hamburger"
61,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great and unique burgers.  Friendly staff and reasonable prices.
62,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My second visit to Amsterdam. I had to go back here as the experience last year was great. Really good burgers and nice staff.
63,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Says ‚Äúbest burger in Amsterdam‚Äù on the window and they could very well be right!
Really delicious burger and returned again three days later."
64,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, service is friendly and quick. My burger was nearly too big (Not really!) My wife is a veggie and thought hers was too like meat! I had to check to make sure it wasn't. Beer was made for the restaurant and was a good range, I went with their IPA. Overall great and friendly."

66,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were looking for a hamburger restaurant in the neighborhood, what a great recommendation this was. By far one of the best burgers and steak we have ever eaten in a great and relaxed atmosphere with friendly personnel. We have tried their ‚Ä¶"

70,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful place in a heart of Amsterdam with lovely and helpful colleagues! You can seat on the terrace (if weather allows) and enjoy great selection or wine and beer and of course best burger I had in years!

73,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great! The Burger and the fries are just amazing and tasty!
74,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered nothing but sides this time, most of them good. The bitterballen and fries are preferable over the ribs, the color and taste seemed a tiny bit off.
Good beer, and from a previous visit I would definitely vouch for the burgers."
75,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great burgers. Patron was very friendly but the staff seemed to be too busy and disorganised. The table allocation for waiting staff seemed very random so no one seemed to know what was going on. It took 3 requests to 3 people for the second beer we ordered.  Maybe just caught it on a bad day. Definitely a gt place to eat.
76,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The place really has good burgers. I'm not particularly fan of too much stuffs in my burger. But the burger from this place taste really good with all those ingredients and sauces. I would skip the fries, they were average and didn't ‚Ä¶"

Can't wait to come back"
80,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fun atmosphere and good service. Love the decor!
81,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great steaks, friendly service. The chicken wings are more like mini-drumsticks than wings tho, but the slow cooked pork ribs are great although my friend said the sauce was too sweet so could possible come sauce separate and then everyone will be happy."
82,Ter Marche & Co, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice location, okay‚Äôish food and Not a good service"
83,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best burgers I've ever eaten! Well worth the money! Staff were great and friendly. Clean and tidy and service was awesome. Highly recommend!
84,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,2 years ago,You wouldn't expect a High level Burger Joint like this  in this location. Eat your Burger here if you're gonna eat one and choose from several International Price winning and Juicy variaties. We were totally surprised by the high quality ‚Ä¶
85,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,a year ago,We went there for lunch on our day trip in Amsterdam and we really enjoyed it. The best burger award lured us in and we were justified. Everything was great! Especially those sweet potato fries üòç. Also great atmosphere and service.

87,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great atmosphere. Gojira burger was amazing
88,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"It says best burgers on the door and it doesn't disappoint. I had the sliders and each one tasted different, delicious. They are large for sliders so they are a big portion on their own. Good selection of beers too. The vegetarian choices were, a veggie burger, a salad, asparagus with poached egg and  fries."

112,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Wow what an amazing place for hanging with mates over a meal. I ordered a great burger with farmhouse cheese and it was delicious. They have won the best burger in Amsterdam for a good reason. They also have awesome tunes to get you pumped for a night out in Amsterdam
113,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I liked the way the burger is seasoned, extra toppings are nice, but the patty was quite dry and so was the bun... 4 stars therefore"
114,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Where most establishments claim they have ""the best"" burgers, these guys have the trophies to prove it!

119,Ter Marche & Co, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Good burgers. Love their fries more though.
120,Ter Marche & Co, 1 star ,2 years ago,Came in to take something to drink on our way home one night around 10-11. 25min before a waiter noticed us - there were a total of 8 people there including us. Our beers took another 20min before we got them and another 30min before we could pay. A real nice way of ending a otherwise wonderful evening.

126,Ter Marche & Co, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Below-average burger, good ingredients but hastily put together on an over-toasted bun that got soaked with sauce, making it fall apart. Sad to have to eat a burger with knife and fork! There are better burger places nearby."
127,Ter Marche & Co, 1 star ,3 years ago,"burgers are good, but not sensibly better than those at Macdonalds, service and client care are downright horrible: nobody understood what we wanted and some waiters even denied talking to us before, without looking us up in the eyes. All in all:  we would have been better off in a McDonald"

136,Ter Marche & Co, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Sit outside and take in the view, if there are seats. There's only a few. The beer is good; the service is ok but the real treat is the location. 'Great people watching site.  You'll pay handsomely for the privilege, though. I;m not sure its worth the cost."
137,Ter Marche & Co, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best burguers i've ever had in my life, and an amazing waitress ( with a heartbeat tatoo) that helped us all along the order and gave us directions to have an awesome night at a live music rock club. Please thank her for everything!"
