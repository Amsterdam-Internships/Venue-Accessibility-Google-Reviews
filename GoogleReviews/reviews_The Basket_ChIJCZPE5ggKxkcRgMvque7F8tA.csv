When ordering a Lagunitas draft beer, you get it served in the original small …"
1,The Basket, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Unfortunately this place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars. The service definitely needs improvement in friendliness and timing and their food (soup and sandwiches) were quite disappointing.
2,The Basket, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Staff were friendly, food was simple, tasty and served quickly. A bit pricey but all round a nice atmosphere."
3,The Basket, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"It's ridiculous that a bar - the only one - in the middle of a university campus could have such pathetic choice of beers. Food is decent, though not cheap. The obvious feeling is that they take advantage of being the only bar around, and skip on improving their offer."
4,The Basket, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Had a lunch with friends and family after a promotion. There was very little food and the waitress forgot drinks regularly. Would not recommend to go to if you’re looking for lunch.
5,The Basket, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice bar, the food is good, a bit expensive maybe... But pretty good nonetheless. Staff is usually very nice as well. It's a great place to have dinner and some drinks. However it's very unfortunate that they close relatively rarly..."
6,The Basket, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very cozy place... Nice and friendly service!
7,The Basket, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Campus bar of VU, good price, good taste. The terrace is open during summer. Remember to make a reservation."
8,The Basket, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy.  Always busy and always wrong bill. Never  less of course.  So... remember always well what you have ordered.
9,The Basket, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A very cosy and relaxing place. The coffee quality was great. Ideal for a break between lectures.
10,The Basket, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"A bit pricey, especially considering that the place is located on a University campus. Place is warm and new but to be honest, not particularly enthusing."
11,The Basket, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A very nice bar, with interesting wooden design walls. The best place to chill after a long day at university"
12,The Basket, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Fine selection of bites and drinks, but little lively though so ideally situated at the VU campus."
13,The Basket, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love this place for their ever delicious nachos and IPA. Definitely worth a visit.
