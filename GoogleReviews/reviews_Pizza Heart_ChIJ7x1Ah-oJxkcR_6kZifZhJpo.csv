1,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Used to be good but unfriendly people working there now… i’ll never go back again. they dont know anything about customer retention. I’ve been eating there for two years and few times has similar experience but last time was very bad! They didn’t give me the pizza because i didn’t have dutch bank card!
Cash or nothing!"
2,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent pizza at a fair price. The restaurant does delivery and has some tables to stay. It's not big but worth to have the pizza there. The pleasure of having a pizza that just left the wood oven is awesome!
3,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,a month ago,Staff really useless the pizza is awful never tasted something worse. The guys working there are really rude and piece of s***t. Place to avoid 100%
4,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"A decent, tasty pizza. Thin crust, nothing too fancy.

They do have a crazy amount of topping combinations for you not-picky-people out …"
5,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,8 months ago,I've ordered pizzas from this place on ubereats. 4 pizzas and none of them was edible. I never thought it was possible to ruin a pizza this much.. One was too salty that you couldn't have a bite without drinking water. Two were incredibly …
6,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,4 months ago,very nice located spot with a tasty pizza
7,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good pizza for a decent price (for Amsterdam standards). Perfect for takeway, take it to one of the canals nearby, take a seat and enjoy :)"
8,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,a year ago,"I ordered from Pizza heart for the first time today. Unfortunately turned out to be a horrible experience. Though not the restaurants fault, the pizza was delivered in the worst state (completely tilted on its head and all the ingredients were all over the place). Really took away the fun of enjoying a pizza."
9,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Tried both at home and on site.I recommend to everyone.Excellent pizza made with quality products.  Qualified and sociable staff. Excellent price. Excellent home service
10,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It was cold outside and the pizza war oh so warm! Glad I went! Nice people running the show there. <3
11,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Real fresh italian pizza, attention only cash!, variety kinds of pizza , parmegana is delicious ,no space to set inside only two tables, even outside two only , worth to try specially if u dont like American pizza"
12,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty good 8/10 Italian style pizza in a very central location. The sit down facilities are very limited. The staff is super friendly, warm and informal. If you are looking for a smart Italian style cozy place for dinner, this is the WRONG …"
13,Pizza Heart, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Very disappointing! They just through the ingredients paying no attention; some of them salty as hell and some others tasteless; chewy dough and burnt on the edges and bottom; the only good thing is that is filling and and at least was delivered fast; never again!
14,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice pizzeria. It seems like a fast food but when you eat the pizza you wouldn't recognize that fact. It's very delicious and authentic Italian experience.
15,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,a year ago,"Amateur hour. Don't order here. I did via Uber Eats. To elaborate, the only vegan option comes WITHOUT the option to pick gluten free dough. If requested via the note, they will not care. Pizza will also not be cut in slices if requested. …"
16,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Absolutely stunnig fast! Other restaurants, especially italian 1h wait in weekends! Pizza Hearth? 10 min! They know their job"
17,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pizza Heart is a small pizzeria within walking distance of all the central attractions. It features a wood-burning oven which gives the handmade pizzas a wonderful texture. …
18,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I always visit as many pizza places as I can when I travel and this ranks 3rd on my list so far.. ever. Truly delicious and very Italian, just how I like it.
The pizzas were small at first glance but I struggled to finish mine by the end."
19,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good pizza.

We had a delivery problem ones, but they called us by phone to solve the problem. Thank you for that."
20,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Pizza is very nice. A lot of cheese. A lot of toppings. The crust is perfect and the pizza is made in the real oven. But please, cut the damn pizza."
21,Pizza Heart, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I ordered here because they have a vegan pizza on the menu. Unfortunately the vegan cheese was on top of all the other toppings, which made the bite very sticky. And sadly the pizza was not hot anymore when I got it. The delivery was on time and friendly. Oh also the rucola is missing!"
22,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"For takeaway/to go. They have also a few table outside but no service, you take your pizza in the box. We tried two times, the dough is exactly the same, crusty and cooked nice. They use real wood and classic Italian pizza oven. The sauce …"
23,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It is a hole in the wall but has the most amazing real Italian pizza in town. From a real furnace.
The deserts are delicious.
They also have a selection of vegan pizzas."
24,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,3 years ago,Ordered a pizza trough uber eats. Might be it was good but if I want pizza without onions - I expect to get pizza without onions. But my one was full of it. So 1 star for ignoring preferences and no more orders from this place.
25,Pizza Heart, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Average pizza, taste is ok and they have most of the popular flavors. Price for the small size it’s a bit too high but you can expect anything different as the place is located in one of the most visited area of Amsterdam"
26,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Not sure why this place as not a high score because the pizza is a true Italian style and delicious. I agree the service and the stuff are not the nicest but if you are looking for a great real Italian pizza at a reasonable price in the heart of Amsterdam this is the place to go. Great location , great food, great price"
27,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They are terrible. I orederd one using the telephone number and they simply forgot about my order. They told me that I should wait more than 2 hours. Because they are too ""busy"", trying to make me as fool. Honestly, you should know the basics about how to deliver a pizza. I'm not stupid and your service is the worst in Amsterdam."
28,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Supposedly they don’t take credit cards, yet they have Uber eats etc running in and out. We used our last euros here and it was average at best."
29,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Pretty quick, delicious and a fair price, nice people and great atmosphere!"
30,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Literally the best late night food in Amsterdam! I love to come here after having a few drinks and the pizza is amazingly savory! Plus, they offer some oil and chilli flakes, all I need for a antastic taste!"
31,Pizza Heart, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizza is “just okay”, nothing special and doesn’t taste like the Italian one. The day I went there the working staff was not friendly also. But it has real vegan options, thanks!"
32,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best pizza's I've had in Amsterdam.  I like De Pizzabakkers a little better, but Pizza Heart wins for best tomato sauce which has a sweeter tangy flavor than most sauces."
33,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious!  The best pizza I ve tried ever. I love it. I can't wait for a Pizza Heart opening in Barcelona, where I live.   Great pizza and amazing staff and service. Highly recommended :)"
34,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing brick oven pizza. The Napoleon was great & had awesome fresh topings. To top it off, the cheese is exactly what you want in your pizza (as long as you wait untill it cools off). Loved it!"
35,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Great pizzas, super fast delivery, arrived hot and fresh.."
36,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Love ordering from Pizza Heart but was very disappointed when visiting in person. The lady who was taking orders was very unhelpful, didn’t listen and when our order came out incorrectly blamed us. A real pity that great food is ruined by bad service."
37,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I ordered 2 pizzas from this restaurant via Uber Eats. The driver only turned up with 1 pizza. He said he would go back to the restaurant and pick up another. He never returned. Tried calling the restaurant and the phone was turned off. I would like a refund, awful service."
38,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great wood fire pizza, 2 vegan options on the menu and they can make any vegetarian option vegan too. Also, the staff are really nice and friendly. Great little shop."
39,Pizza Heart, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Playfully delicious. It's not the absolute best but it is very good and worthy. The pizzas are fresh and made in an gas oven. Try the one pizza with eggplant and garlic.
40,Pizza Heart, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ok service may be a little curt. But this was one of the best pizzas I have had, well priced to. Impossible not to give this place 5 stars."
41,Pizza Heart, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Just an above average pizza, and the owner acting in a really disrespectful manner. If respecting the customer isn't your priority just don't work at the cash register."
