0,Din√°mico, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food is decent BUT we waited more than one hour for our food (fyi on a Sunday 2pm and food arrived at 315pm). Service is good in general but the waiter should have told us if we had to wait so long for the food (if a regular case at all?) ‚Ä¶
1,Din√°mico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Had a really‚Äã nice lunch here. The fish soup was amazing and contained generous amounts of seafood.
2,Din√°mico, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Horrible delivery experience! I ordered two dishes and one starter. They called us to switch the starter and didn‚Äôt explained correctly, so when it came here it was an awful surprise. Plus, they simply didn‚Äôt delivery one of the dishes. And also, the package was completely dirty, disgusting!!!"

7,Din√°mico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food. To be in the middle of down town the prices are just awesome. If you don‚Äôt want to be waiting on line make a reservation the place gets full very quick. Try the sangria üëåüëå
8,Din√°mico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are looking for a really special restaurant this is the place to go. It's a really small place, a family business. You will eat beautiful food, get a 5 star treatment and I am sure you will return again. For lunch I suggest their burrito. And don't skip dessert: try their queso de leche! Mmmmmm..."
