0,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The best Vietnamese noodles I've eaten in Amsterdam üòç we ordered the beef and the stew one (which is number 1 and 2 on the menu) ‚Ä¶
1,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Pho is superb and the drip coffee is actually too intensely sweet like some of the others I‚Äôve had before. Good service and cheap prices too. Be here early or at odd times as the shop is slightly small and can be filled rather quickly
2,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Should have more that 4.1 starts. Fast and delish. The pho compares to those you would expect to taste on the streets of Hanoi or HCM
3,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The meals are prepared exactly like in Saigon: the soup Pho and the sandwiches are particularly tasty. I recommend this address to vietnamese foodies.
4,Little Saigon, 1 star ,5 months ago,"The people who gave more than 1 star :
- Are probably Ductch and only knows Bitterballen for lunch and dinner.
- Never went to a proper Vietnamese Restaurant. ‚Ä¶"
5,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good restaurant offering a nice variety of dishes, we enjoyed our food there and would return"
6,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The pho was good. The meatballs were great, as were the other meats. Just in general the broth was a bit to meaty (see the dark colour in my picture) in my opinion and lacked some of the herby flavours I have come to expect in Pho. Also ‚Ä¶"
7,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,9 months ago,Tried beef and chicken baguette. The first was great the second not so much despite the bread being really good. The summer rolls were below average. The location is nice and prices are ok.
8,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I‚Äôve been here many many times and the food is always fresh, delicious, the portion is huge. One of the top Vietnamese eateries of Amsterdam. The place is tiny, and the queue is long almost always, waiting time goes up to 30 minutes to an ‚Ä¶"
9,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great Pho and B√°nh M√¨, not all Pho is created equal, the shrimps are no it here, but everything else we‚Äôve tried is amazing. Cheap Banh Mi that‚Äôs perfect for the little hunger <3"
10,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We came in around 17h00 Sunday night, and after that it's almost full, and there were people outside waiting, due to its limited seats.
PHO with 4 beef toppings were good but mine was not with enough soup, which was ‚Ä¶"
11,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great and cheap. Without a doubt one of the best Vietnamese in Amsterdam.
12,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Before the expanded menu the food was always excellent but not so much now. Perhaps it was our choices. The dishes were average. The side plate of green veges bore zero relationship to the menu photo/description and definitely not worth ‚Ç¨8.
13,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Small and quiet place with really good food! Nice serving, pretty fast too, and the menu is quite complex. Lots and lots of interesting dishes like this Beef Pho or the beef skewers with peanut butter like sauce. Also, the duck was incredibly tasty! Enjoy your meal!"
14,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of tourist attraction in Amsterdam. The place is small. Don't make people waiting outside if you have finished your meal because there will always be a queue.
15,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Restaurant is small but really cozy! Its clean with friendly and multilanguages speaking stuff! They can help you if you dont know what to order! We have been there with older people they said it was really delicious! I would rather say was so close like in Vietnam! Its reall food with a passion! And the prices?! Cheap as hell;)
16,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious food and large portions, especially for Amsterdam standards/price. However, service was very bad and not the best atmosphere. Would recommend this if you want a quick bite, not for a long diner."
17,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A good place for authentic Vietnamese pho and coffee. The soup base for pho tastes very good. They also have a good selection of starters dishes to choose from. Only a 5+ mins walk from Amsterdam Centraal. Friendly staff too.
18,Little Saigon, 1 star ,6 months ago,We went to this establishment on the 9th of September for dinner. The staff are rude and unwelcoming. ‚Ä¶
19,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice, friendly service. Absolutely delicious food, for very reasonable prices. Would definitely recommend. Especially the chicken sandwich is incredible value"
20,Little Saigon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food was amazing however service was horrendous!!!
Food - 4/5
Service - 0/5 ‚Ä¶"
21,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Value for money authentic Vietnamese food
The Pho and Bahn Mi are amazing!
For drink I always order avocado shake, not the best, but i love avocado anyway"
22,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,This small restaurant seats about 30 people and was busy when we visited last night. The decor is basic but quite acceptable. We waited for about 15 minutes on the seats provided outside. I had the chicken prawn and meatball Pho that was ‚Ä¶
23,Little Saigon, 1 star ,4 months ago,Not authentic. Pho broth is cheap and just salt. Beoth is not even hot. And the bo kho has no potatos. Service is mediocre
24,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great place. I've ended up here a few times while visiting Amsterdam, and it's always been a joy. Small but cosy place, very friendly staff, and great prices. The food is very richly flavoured, with hot and cold dishes really mixing well. Definitely a recommendation if you like spicy food."
25,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Super tasty special beef Pho, authentic flavours, fresh noodles, included the sliced beef, beef brisket, beef meatballs and tripe, just like the traditional pho I'm used to. I also ordered the Traditional Banh Mi with sliced pork, picked ‚Ä¶"
26,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The soup noodles were great. The fried rice salty. The service very nice
27,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I am here on vacation in Amsterdam and it‚Äôs chilly with a low of 40F and decide to stop by for some warm  soup to warm the spirit.  Of course we had to experience the local water sources.  It was very pleasant just like the atmosphere and ‚Ä¶
28,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good flavours. The avocado shake could have been larger. Not quite worth the ‚Ç¨4. Otherwise nice place with cheap prices.
29,Little Saigon, 2 stars ,7 months ago,I ordered the vegan tofu pho and the vegan spring rolls. However the rolls arrived immediately yet still frozen on the inside. Meanwhile the pho‚Äôs broth was super tasteless and the overall dish as well did not satisfy me. Would not recommend.
30,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice and small little Vietnamese restaurant. I had a very delicious Pho soup with shredded chicken. I got a big bowl of pho soup (a nice chicken broth noddels and chicken breast )with herbs and  beans sprout for 10 euro, and that was a good price."
31,Little Saigon, 1 star ,7 months ago,"We took 3 different diches. Seems correct price but in the bawls : Lot of vegetables and very little portion of meat/chimp. No reduction for students while indicated on poster. Other plates : also small meat/chimp portions and very strong taste in sauces. If you mix sauce with your rice, you cannot eat the rice anymore."
32,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Like this place offering good raw beef pho with a reasonable price. Perfect for a cold/windy weather supper!
33,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was delicious üòã Extremely clear hot broth. A little pricey but the food is quality.üëç
Definitely not one to miss üòç"
34,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,a year ago,It really the Delicious and nice beef noodle soup having in the cold winter.
35,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"I tested avocado milshake. Id' never imagine that, unique ü•ëü•õ"
36,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I come here all the time and the food never disappoints! If you want cheap, good Vietnamese food; this is the place to go"
37,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"It‚Äôs delicious but I think the soup of the pho can be hotter so when veggies are added later, they won‚Äôt taste that raw.
Bread is super delicious and service is also good"
38,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"By far the best food experience thus far in Amsterdam. Delightfully delicious food, attentive and sweet wait staff, and cozy semi-authentic interior experience lends itself to a well-deserved five stars."
39,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favorite Pho is Amsterdam. At 10‚Ç¨ a soup, it‚Äôs a great option for a cold winter day."
40,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very good Asian food and not expensive at all! Cozy atmosphere
41,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing pho! Very fast service also! Definitely would recommend!
42,Little Saigon, 1 star ,6 months ago,The worst B√°nh m√¨ with Tofu I ever tried I don't now about the options with meat but the one with Tofu was really bad.
43,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Delicious Pho, nice cozy place. Worth the try"
44,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Small restaurant, popular and busy. Cheap and delicious traditional Vietnamese food."
45,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good place, both for lunch and dinner. Large portions, very tasty and at a good price."
46,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good pho, very tasty and not expensive totally recomended"
47,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the most authentical pho I had so far, at least among the pho I tried in Europe. Love it that you get to choose extras, such as tripe and meatballs since you can neither expect meatballs included nor as an option at most places. And ‚Ä¶"
48,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good Viet restaurant in the centre of Amsterdam, with very nice staff!"
49,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice waitress place is clean and quite affordable. Nice for tourists as well they give free wifi
50,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very nice genuine Vietnamese food!
51,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This is an excellent little Vietnamese cafe in the back streets of Amsterdam in a predominantly Chinese town type area. We stumbled on it by chance, but we where very happy with it. Very basic surroundings much like you get in China town in ‚Ä¶"
52,Little Saigon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"That was just gross and an insult when call it authentic Vietnamese food! Can‚Äôt understand the good reviews! The noodles were cutting small, barely cooked, soup tasteless, Mayonnaise instead of the promised liver pate in ‚Äûbanh mi‚Äú, meat was ‚Ä¶"
53,Little Saigon, 1 star ,8 months ago,"We ordered from little Saigon via Uber Eats and were very very disappointed. The food was tasteless, very small portions, expensive and totally not authentic. Literally the worst take away we‚Äôve ever gotten, never again."
54,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing service by Ellis! She went above and beyond with my allergy (gluten). Lovely food. Great atmosphere! We had the fresh shrimp spring rolls and the grilled prawns and beef/chicken salad bowl. The deep fried spring rolls are even gluten free!
55,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The chicken spring rolls were delicious. The braised beef pho was quite good as well, especially the beef! ‚Ä¶"
56,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"GOOD FOOD, LOVELY SERVICE BUT NO FREE TAP WATER üí¶"
57,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing Pho Ga! Not the most cosy place but the food makes up for it.
58,Little Saigon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I was looking forward to eat here as I love asian food. What a disappointment... Spring rolls were great (but really pricey for the quality, you can find better for half price in Paris or London). Worst, my banh mi doesn't taste good, my tofu was bland (no seasoning). Even worst, the staff is absolutely antipathetic and unwelcoming."
59,Little Saigon, 1 star ,a year ago,"So bad food, I don't know why it can be so popular and remarkable on google. First, the soup is worse than instant soup. Second, the rice noodle is quite hard, it seems like uncooked. ‚Ä¶"
60,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful pho,  served fast. Decent prices too."
61,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The Pho is not good - very fat meet & soup. But the shrimp chicken salad and the summer rolls are really good. More like a fast food restaurant but so also the prices. It‚Äôs okay.
62,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I love pho soup from this place. It was not as good as my first visit there some years ago. I missed the extra hot serving. Place is very small, sometimes difficulty to get a seat. However, still a good place to enjoy a delicious soup."
63,Little Saigon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I was so happy to find a vietnamese restaurant but I ended up so disappointed. The welcome wasn't really friendly and we felt like we weren't welcome. The food wasn't that good too. I was so sad about the spring rolls... So expensive and ‚Ä¶
64,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I always get the raw beef Pho!!!!!1! Cozy, public transport-esque atmosphere. Avocado shake is üëåüèºüëåüèºüíØ"
65,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best Vietnamese food in Amsterdam.
Kind staff, quick serving and amazing food!"
66,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was super average, avocado smoothie a disappointment. Usually my go to drink at a Vietnamese restaurant haha but worst one I‚Äôve ever had. Glass half empty and it wasn‚Äôt cold. Food was standard. Super hot inside the small restaurant, even after taking off my jacket I was sweating."
67,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Waitress was pretty rude. Pho was only okay; salty and I didn't like the type of thick noodles but they gave you a decent amount of meat.
68,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Still some of the best Vietnamese food in Amsterdam. Be careful if you plan on eating here in the weekend. You might have to be forced to wait outside the restaurant until a table is free. They also have a no reservation policy and the ‚Ä¶
69,Little Saigon, 1 star ,2 years ago,Average food but terrible customer service. The blonde girl‚Äôs cold attitude was unacceptable. Her facial expression was so cheeky when taking order and left us waiting at the table for the bill for 5 minutes minutes while chatting with ‚Ä¶
70,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,3 months ago,The food was okay.
71,Little Saigon, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Very bad costumer service. Almost as if they were annoyed. Food was okay
72,Little Saigon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We went there yesterday, we waited for a table like 20 mins and the staffs were even forgot that we were waiting outside! (cause we saw there was a table already clean for at least 5 min and the staffs were chatting.) ‚Ä¶"
73,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Honestly, the pho is rather cheap and absolutely delicious! I highly recommend it, it's quite authentic. The ice tea lemongrass was super refreshing and tasty! ‚Ä¶"
74,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice Vietnamese place. It's rather small but usually doesn't take more than 10 minutes to get a table. The Bahn mi are really good - fresh and crisp baguette with curry and chicken.
75,Little Saigon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Little Saigon was really disappointing. All of the dishes that we ordered were greasy, salty and inauthentic. The vermicelli noodles were like pasta. Most of all, none of the dishes tasted good, the flavours were really lacking. Don't waste your money."
76,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very authentic! I liked the atmosphere there. Quite and very relaxing. The pho was very good and recommend #1 if you like tripe. Staff is welcoming and service was very quick.
77,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Little Saigon is an excellent Vietnamese restaurant where the food is delicious. I love the noodle beef soup called PHO.  There are also other delicious dishes which I like as well and this dish is white rice noodle containing beef, spring ‚Ä¶"
78,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Great food friendly staff
79,Little Saigon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very awlful service, the attitude of the Asian staff is horrible, no support and no solution and all was complains. From waiting outside till sitting down she was even ignoring us as guests even we ""helloed "" and ""excuse me"" many times. ‚Ä¶"
80,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"There was a mix-up with my order and the restaurant fixed it well in my favor, with friendliness and urgency. Food was also very, very, very tasty!"
81,Little Saigon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"!!!   TOURIST ALERT   !!!

For table of 5, we waited at least 10 minute until the 2 chatting waitress ‚Ä¶"
82,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Bun Bo Hue and Banh Mi were okay, Pho Bo was good. The soups kind of lacked some taste, the Banh Mi had no p√¢t√© and the baguette was not really good. But I think this is individual taste and the staff was very friendly and polite."
83,Little Saigon, 1 star ,3 years ago,No complains about the food. But the service was very unprofessional with their funny logic. We saw some food fell down on the floor by the previous customers before we sat down.One particular waitress who was exceptionally rude with her ‚Ä¶
84,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It was an ok restaurant but it wasn't as good as we thought it'd be. After living in Vietnam 12 years, I can confirm that this is pretty far from real Vietnamese food. ‚Ä¶"
85,Little Saigon, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I used to be a big fan of this place. Great pho, friendly staff.
However today our waitress treated us horribly. Threw the menu at my face, etc. The service depends on the staffs' mood. The boss needs to correct the staffs' manners. It's a shame I won't be back here again."
86,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good vietnamese food. Really nice pho. Tiny restaurant so expect to have to wait outside anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 during busy hours. Best for couples or singles as this can shave off waiting time.
87,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"We heard so much good stuff about Vietnamese cuisine in general, my wife and I planned to eat at the one nearest by. It happened to be this little eatery serving Vietnamese street food. We tried 4 different dishes I forgot the names of... ‚Ä¶"
88,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Do not trust a viet restaurant that can't make a proper, simple lemongrass tea. This is lemon iced tea with sliced lemon grass....."
89,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very tasty food! Portions are generous and we'll presented. Ingredients are fresh and we'll prepared. It quickly become one of my top 10 places to eat in Amsterdam...
90,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The Ph√≤ was very good and the price is okay.
91,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An excellent little Vietnamese eatery in Amsterdam centrum, possibly the best in the neighborhood, reasonable pricing with friendly services. Pho Bo is authentic, easily comparable to Little Saigon in OC or in the heart of Saigon. Standard fare credit cards welcomed."
92,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food for a good price. It is not super big so sometimes you have to wait a few minutes to get seated. But the food is good and tastes like authentic vietnamese
93,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The name is Little Saigon, but the taste is Little Hanoi. For me, their Pho soup is missing the rich southern Vietnamese flavors of star anise, cinnamon a bit more sweetness. It‚Äôs ok, but not great."
94,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The lady who is the manager is pleasant and service she provided is good. However the food is disappointed. Pho (the soup) is not hot enough and the vegetables comes with it is wrong type to be served with. We wouldn‚Äôt rush back. But the food 3*.
95,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Staff were great, but the bun just didn't cut it for me. The kitchen staff needs to include mint in their bun. I'm comparing to great bun places in NYC and Los Angeles so don't let that stop you. Go get some pho!"
96,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I went there specifically for banh mi (Vietnamese baguette sandwich) and Vietnamese coffee. I was disappointed with roasted pork banh mi but the one with chicken (I think it was lemon grass), was great. The Vietnamese coffee was tasty and chocolaty, just like in Vietnam. Well priced for Amsterdam"
97,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My favorite pho place in Amsterdam. Service is good and fast. The setting may not be the coziest but good food. I've tried the various pho soups and fresh spring rolls, very good taste."
98,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really nice food and very affordable! Place is quite small so not that great when you go with many people. Vegetarian options available and the home made ice tea is so great!
99,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Not much of service, but friendly smiles from the staff.. Little cozy spot to have a taste of Vietnamese food. Not the best pho I've eaten but still good. Easy access from Centraal station."
100,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tasty soups, flanked by a mix of aromatic leafs to add. A touch of the far away Vietnam in Amsterdam.
The price is more than adequate considering the big portions."
101,Little Saigon, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Authentic review: the chicken is expired or what, has bad smell, and the staff(I don‚Äôt wanna be rude, but the staff is stupid) I am paying what you let me. I will never go to this place anymore, I also don‚Äôt recommend everyone go there, you will regret. And the Dutch staff, clean your dirty mouth and bring a clear brain and work!"
102,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Whenever I go to Amsterdam, chances are big to have my brunch or lunch at Little Saigon. There is often a table free when early at noon, despite being frequented by a lot of people in the busy street of Zeedijk. The Vietnamese dishes are fresh, rich, tasty and affordable, and try out their variety of drinks as well."
103,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food is lovely. Been a regular customer here and it feels like home to visit this place for a hot bowl of Pho. Prices are reasonable and staff is quite fast in serving the food.
104,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of my favourite little restaurants.
105,Little Saigon, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Such a Terrible disappointment take away  banh mi is very  dry and tasteless .
We did not get what we ordered ‚Ä¶"
106,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best veggie pho I ever ate. Tried different Pho places in Amsterdam but this one is the best so far! I will be back
107,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Small Vietnamese 'streetfood' style restaurant, always many tourist here so you might need to wait for a spot during the weekends. Food is good for a reasonable price, best Vietnamese in Amsterdam? No."
108,Little Saigon, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food usually does not look like the pictures in the menu, but they taste oke. Place is small and the staff is in these years still unexperience. Often taking the order incorrectly, but they do change it to the correct one after telling them."
109,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service,   Avocado smoothie was a furst and very good.  The tofu diah could have a bit more salad besides the carrot's salad."
110,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great quality Pho.
111,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a very small, crowded takeaway-like place. Don't expect great dining experience - but food is good, staff of extremelly kind and helpful and it is fast. Food is good: fresh and tasty. This is a good place to guickly eat something or take away."
112,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Slightly dissapointed in the chicken pho that was missing the fragnance, depth and flavor of a good pho. Tasted more like a typical chicken noodle soup. The rice with beef satay and spring rolls was better. Spring rolls were really good :-)"
113,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Restaurant is always full, you‚Äôre lucky if you don‚Äôt have to wait for a table. Stuff is very friendly and nice. I love the pho soup here!"
114,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great portion size!
115,Little Saigon, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was OK and quite cheap but service was really bad.  We were ignored when we arrived,  were told to wait outside a bit as it was full but they never came  back to us and finally when we sat at a table,  it took 20 min for the waitress to take our order.  We didn't not feel welcomed at all.."
116,Little Saigon, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We could not have even a chance to eat here. As soon as we got in, the waitress did not give a bit of attetion. We were asked to wait for 20 minutes while there were 2 empty tables without bothering to explain us. The tone of the language (in Dutch) was really rude to us."
117,Little Saigon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really expensive for the food they offer. Also, too crowed, too small, kitchen just beside you and they couldnt even turn on the A.C. on the good side the waiter was really nice and even prevent from some girls stealing our spots"
118,Little Saigon, 1 star ,3 years ago,Horrible customer service and soup noodles taste bland. Felt discriminated there and I am Vietnamese. Forgot my order and credit card machine malfunctioned. Total dinner time was 1.5hr waiting for 3 dishes. üò≤
119,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Simple Vietnamese cafe. It's small and closes early (9.30 pm) but not expensive for a quick chicken and fried rice simple meal.
120,Little Saigon, 1 star ,3 years ago,The waitresses were not nice. We wanted to take our time in order to eat properly but were almost forced to leave so that other tourists could come in. My plate wasn't even empty.
121,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I always eat banh mi everytime i go there as it reminds me of my Vietnamese vacations so it brings me back nice memories. Staff is always nice. Service is quick as well. Price is super good!
122,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great portion and tasted amazing!
123,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excelent true Vietnamese food. The chicken ph·ªü is very good. Also the waitresses are very fast and very friendly. The price is also fair. I recommend this place
124,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Place is little natrow  but food is really good. Not so expensive not cheap too. It's absolutely fine to eat here.
125,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,A little bit non authentic Vietnamese food but it is not surprise for this type of non authentic food here ! At least it provides some type of Vietnamese food flavor for my long trip !
126,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food quality is oke for Amsterdam city standards, strawberry iced tea was deliciously prepared.
Also very cozy and friendly staff"
127,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Best Italian food in the city
128,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"After 2.5 years in the city, I can finally say I found my favorite Vietnamese place! Delicious fresh food, good service and very reasonable prices."
129,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Quite tasty, we had the raw beef pho, curry chicken rice and one of the salads and everything was tasty and fresh - definitely will be back for a quick easy and pretty cheap meal."
130,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The service is really nice. Very friendly staff. The food is okay. Portion is slight too small for me. But overall had a good time here!!
131,Little Saigon, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The owner need to watch their staff. I went in when it was busy, I think the staff- blonde girl-   didn‚Äôt want more customers, she told us to go, shut the door quick ( even my husband  and the kids was going to walk in, it was only around 19:00 and in April)."
132,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the first places I went to get pho in Amsterdam and it was delicious. The second time I was here I had a Vietnamese style chicken sandwich and it really was lekker !! Would visit that place every time I am in Amsterdam
133,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great friendly service, excellent food and very good price for the large portions. Authentic pho! Absolutely delicious."
134,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food, ok service. Would definitely recommend this if you're in the mood for some good vietnamese food."
135,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We ate pho and spring rolls. Everyone LOVED the food, the service was good, and prices were reasonable. Would go again."
136,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious slow-cooked meat
137,Little Saigon, 1 star ,4 years ago,This place serves tofu that is served with chicken or beef stock but this is not clear on the menu at all!  So their tofu dishes are not vegetarian. Only one vegetarian dish. Quite weird
138,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not bad but far from authentic. Too spicy,  salty. OK for a dutch Vietnamese restaurant though."
139,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food and great service - we had spring rolls, summer rolls and pho. All so fresh and tasty!"
140,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a very nice pho. Small and place crowded place, fair prices. Would go again."
141,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super tasty food and people are so very kind! I forgot my phone on the table and someone from there brought it back to me ! Thanks a lottt! <3
142,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful vietnamese food really enjoyed it glad we tried here can be a bit cramped for space but glad they could fit us in either way.
143,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great pho noodle soup. Tasty stock! Service average and drinks are too small for the price.
144,Little Saigon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I've never left a Google review in my life. That's how good this place is. Excellent food, well priced and lovely service."
145,Little Saigon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The soup was not that impressive
146,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice small restaurant in China town. Food was good and the staffs are very friendly. I will come back again for my next visit in Amsterdam

Well priced for Amsterdam"

154,Little Saigon, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Staff were great, but the bun just didn't cut it for me. The kitchen staff needs to include mint in their bun. I'm comparing to great bun places in NYC and Los Angeles so don't let that stop you. Go get some pho!"

156,Little Saigon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The lady who is the manager is pleasant and service she provided is good. However the food is disappointed. Pho (the soup) is not hot enough and the vegetables comes with it is wrong type to be served with. We wouldn‚Äôt rush back. But the food 3*.
