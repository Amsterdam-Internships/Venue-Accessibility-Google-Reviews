0,La Bettola, 4 stars ,3 years ago,had a quick bite there. food was good no complaints. the pizza we ordered was tasty and the staff were nice and fast since they knew we did not have much time.
1,La Bettola, 1 star ,6 months ago,"They have never heard of olive oil or parmesan cheese‚Ä¶ The food is very plastic, not a single Italian here, the beer is waaaay overpriced.
Would not recommend."
2,La Bettola, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Kind atmosphere with Italians, good pizza and lasagna. They were out of tiramisu, so I am not able to rate that part of service."
3,La Bettola, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizza was good, but need to wait a long for it. Its a small place, but staff is really nice."
4,La Bettola, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst Italian place I‚Äôve ever visited.

I tried to pay with credit card and they told me that they don‚Äôt have POS ‚Ä¶"
5,La Bettola, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Absolutely the worst pizzas we have ever had. Undercooked, almost inedible. Unfriendly service. The 3 employees just stood around talking loudly while we ate. When we requested the bill, they said cash only. When we didn‚Äôt have enough cash, ‚Ä¶"
6,La Bettola, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A real good pizzeria. Here you get a quality pizza that actually taste as they do in Italy. Nice Italian music, a good atmosphere and friendly staff. I tried several pizzerias in the city but for this one i like to walk a few miles. And the price is great too. I can recommend it."
7,La Bettola, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely amazing. The staff was very friendly. The food was so good
Very traditional and the food is home made. You do have to wait, but like I said the food is home made. We will definitely be back before we fly home. The spaghetti is so delish. The noodles are so soft. Definitely a  must try."
8,La Bettola, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst restaurant I have been to in my life. I ordered pizza here yesterday and I was vomiting within one hour!!! I still feel sick now. This place should be shut down, they are unhygienic! I have never experienced having to vomit after just ONE hour of eating food."
9,La Bettola, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"All we wanted was a slice or two.. My wife and I went in, ordered tea and orange juice, and a pizza Margarita, which is 5E. We got the drinks right away, but even though the place was almost empty, we had to wait about half an hour (!!) for ‚Ä¶"
10,La Bettola, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great choice of pizza (and pasta and salads  . . . ). With really light, crispy bases! Served quickly. Very friendly staff. Definitely worth a visit for a light lunch or brunch. üëçüëçüëåüëå"
11,La Bettola, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was ok. They wrote on menu that credit card would be accepted. We wanted to pay with card, but were told it was not possible. Had to go to ATM for cash money and pay for service. Never again!"
12,La Bettola, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Absolutely awful personnel!!
Normaly you start with a drink, but the waiter furiously asked what we want to eat, even though we wanted to drink first. ‚Ä¶"
13,La Bettola, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The quality of the pizza was average and the service was quite slow although it didn't have many customers. It's good enough for a quick bite.
14,La Bettola, 1 star ,4 years ago,This is a NO GO !!!!  Never again. Pizza was all the way bad experience and I think they really do not pay taxes. Cards didn't work and I had to exit to get cash from ATM. Ordered PIZZA WITHOUT MUSHROOMS. Got with them so waiter took it back and they picked almost all myushrooms away..
15,La Bettola, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Good price, less than 8e for a pizza. Not too dry. You can see the cook doing his thing. The waiter is very enthusiastic."

18,La Bettola, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Very nice place to eat. Good food served by qualified staff. Everything is served quick. Chip, if compared with other restaurants in the area (but sill it isn't something I would like to pay everytime). Interior isn't really bad, but isn't intersting either."
