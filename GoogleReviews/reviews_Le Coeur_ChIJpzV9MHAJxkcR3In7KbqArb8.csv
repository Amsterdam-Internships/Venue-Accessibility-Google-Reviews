5,Le Coeur, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Very nice atmosphere, interesting menu and good flavours. However,  I find it crazy that every person has to pay 2,5 ‚Ç¨ for tap filtered water. Moreover from a bottle of wine that costs 16‚Ç¨, they offer you a glass for 10 ‚Ç¨, I find it very expensive! The service was veeeery slow!"
