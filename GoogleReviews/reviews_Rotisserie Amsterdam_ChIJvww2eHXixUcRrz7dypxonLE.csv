0,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Had the fried chicken bun and loaded fries. Best chicken burger I have had in the Netherlands and possibly even ever. Loaded Fries were super hot, but luckily I can handle spice.  Staff were lovely, and we will 100% be back to try the rest of the menu."
1,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place in vibrant Amsterdam West for the best burgers.

New York style juicy burgers. And friendly staff"
2,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Great food, burgers were amazing. The male server with glasses and longer hair was pretty rude and pushy. I understand its busy but we arrived on time and you still made us uncomfortable."
3,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Had the chicken sandwich bunüëåalso their signature potatoes was super goodüëè
The service was amazing üíØ
Come here eat good food and have a good time"
4,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good food - try the CFC and fried chicken bun.

Loved the music over here and the staffs were super quick! ‚Ä¶"
5,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Food was decent yet could have been better if properly cooked. Rotisserie chicken was decent, skin wasn't very crispy and smaller then i expected but we'll seasoned. Fried chicken was also nicely seasoned but burnt. I went inside to get new ‚Ä¶"
6,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Not a big fan of their fries but BEST burgers in Amsterdam! I had a cheese burger last time, can't wait to eat it again. It reminded me of In-N-Out burgers :)"
7,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Delicious roasted chicken. Awesome fries. Friendly staff, especially the guy with the curly hair üëå"
8,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The fried chicken bun is hands down the best sandwich you'll find in Amsterdam. Their fries are also always super fresh and crispy. And on top of that the staff is extremely friendly and always trying their hardest to make sure you're having a good time.
9,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Patties in my burger were over-over-overcooked. They were !!!crunchy!!! (like fat which was deep fried) and extremely dry and the bacon was the opposite üòñ I found this place in '10 best burgers in Amsterdam' and it definitely doesn't belong.
10,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Such a good chicken burger. A very nice place. The interior design is charming. Lights of candles help the ambience.
The fries is perfect. ‚Ä¶"
11,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, the wings are a bit skinny and jot really that hot but everything else on the menu is worthwhile. We went for a late night bite and it was a exactly what we needed. If you are really nice the waitress will play underworld for you... :)"
12,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Best fries in our lives!
13,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, great atmosphere with very friendly staff and huge selection of beers. Burgers (beef, chicken and vegan options) are huge and gorgeous, portions are generous. Prices are quite low in my opinion for what your getting. ‚Ä¶"
14,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Rotisserie was a good late lunch experience. There were three of us so we were able to entertain ourselves while we waited. It's true the food takes a while but it is cooked to order so it is hot and fresh. We all had chicken and it cooked ‚Ä¶
15,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably caught them on a bad weekend. They were out of hot wings, out of cauliflower and out of something else I don‚Äôt remember.  And the Bibb lettuce radish and avocado salad.... well see for yourself.  I would have just said I was out of ‚Ä¶"
16,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great burgers, loaded fries and a fine selection of local beer."
17,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was tasty, but service was very slow and not attentive at all. Also a bit too warm inside (was a hot day in fairness) and all high tables with stools which I never find especially comfy. Worth a visit for the food if you're in the area!"
18,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,Ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken for takeaway and I absolutely enjoyed it! The texture was juicy and tender and it was so flavourful! Loved the smokey touch to it too. I would recommend ordering it with the blue cheese ranch dressing. ‚Ä¶
19,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious food
We ordered the royal cheese burger and the pork ribs both were so good ‚Ä¶"
20,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool burgers and roasted chicken! The vegetarian burger with portobello is tasty as well, even if it's not the best veggie one that I ever tasted."
21,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Best chicken burger ever‚Ä¶ burger of the month as main wasn‚Äôt bad, still not as good as the chicken bun"
22,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The burgers here are just devine! Absolutely love the balance of flavours and diligence of the chefs. Sweet fries with that gooey cheese sauce are just unbeatable. No doubt, best burger in Amsterdam. Keep it coming, guys!"
23,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 2 stars ,7 months ago,I can‚Äôt speak to in the restaurant these days but do not order on Uber. Chicken was dry like bad humour and my housemate makes a better beyond burger.
24,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,By far the best burger I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam! Great wings/fries as well. Amazing hospitality (from a distance) from owners/workers during such a strange time of self isolation. Can‚Äôt wait to come here and sit outside when restaurants are allowed to have customers again!
25,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 1 star ,11 months ago,Ordering from this restaurant through Deliveroo was the worst experience. We order at 16:12 and were told we should receive our order at 16:30. Then the delivery started getting delayed every 10 minutes until we received the order at 17:40 ‚Ä¶
26,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best food I have ever eaten!
Flavors amazing
Food amazing ‚Ä¶"
27,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Burgers and cocktails were good. The rest? Not so much.
28,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was great. Super tasty burger and super toast fries. The venue was pretty cool and I can see people enjoying it, but in my opinion it was a bit too dark and the music was a bit too loud. It was hard to have a conversation and I ‚Ä¶"
29,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We got the chicken burger and the jalapenos fries. Both were superb. The fries were mouthwatering. Just spicy enough. The burger also was extremely grateful. The chicken was crispy and pretty well done. The prices were also very logical.
30,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 1 star ,a year ago,"I ordered Rotisserie Amsterdam via Deliveroo on 1st January. I'm hoping that the experience in no way sets the tone for the rest of the year. I'd ordered chicken, fries, ribs, corn and a beer. A half-cooked chicken, corn, and the wrong ‚Ä¶"
31,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really loved the food. The roasted chicken is great (as one might expect from a rotisserie), and the sides are equally good. If you are used to American burger joints, this place will expand your horizons on what comes with a burger. The ‚Ä¶"
32,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was Nasty in a good way. if you want to get a good greasy burger with hot wing and blue cheese sauce on the side, this is the place! Fries with jalape√±os were a big too soft but not bad. Kitchen was closed with no head notice ‚Ä¶"
33,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Chicken wings were awesome, the sauce was interesting. Cheeseburger over fries was definitely an interesting idea and good, but I will go for burgers next time - just not my cup of tea."
34,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Some of the best burgers in town. Our family's favorite is basically any burger but then with the addition of ""chili crunch"" (peanuts & chili) - delish! Fun selection of beers & good music & attentive staff"
35,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the best restaurant in Amsterdam hands down. Wings were amazing, amazing hamburger, amazing rotisserie chicken. I've never had chicken like this. It's a must go to place. Drinks are really good to. Chairs are not really comfortable so be prepared to sit on high tops."
36,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Burger bar with a difference. Fun decor and vibe for drinks and great food. Beef burgers are a proper mouthful; don't order the chicken burgers, they are disappointing by comparison. The loaded fries are tasty and filling so order 2 to share between 4 or 5 people."
37,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"By far the best burgers I've ever eaten. Had the Reuben special and their fried chicken burger (with added kimchi). Could not fault a single thing, will definitely be back for more."
38,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food menu and the music was awesome. Excellent customer service
39,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice beer selection, good service and lovely food. The rotisserie chicken was fantastic. I didn't try the burgers, but they look so good I need to come back to this place to try one."
40,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I ate a Royale with Cheese and I must say it was an undercooked and soggy burger. Unfortunately it didn't taste well either. Everything else however was good. The fried chicken was phenomenal and the fries were good. If you go here make ‚Ä¶
41,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Generally friendly staff but we waited 1h20m for the food to arrive (2 people) even though the waiter said it's gonna be 30 min. Nobody seemed to notice the huge delay so there was no starter or water being offered to compensate for the ‚Ä¶
42,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Super tasty burgers. Would go again!
43,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 1 star ,a year ago,I just ordered a burger and some fries and there was hair on my fries. So disgusting also the fries didn‚Äôt taste fresh. It‚Äôs very disappointing because normally the food is very fresh.
44,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,In-freaking-credible. Everything was so fresh. The chicken in the loaded fries was delicious. The onion rings were so crispy and magical. CANT WAIT to come back to Amsterdam
45,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food, we had burger on chips. Great sauces with it sooooo good. Good variety of beers and cocktails. And very important friendly staff."
46,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wow they just blew my mind. Royal with cheese is the best burger in Holland. The loaded fries where amazing to and very nice friendly staff. I‚Äôm hooked
47,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Cool place to hang out with good food. The fried chicken was overcooked which was quite a downside but it still tasted good and the loaded fries are awesome. The Heineken does not taste so fresh though.....
48,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Guys, what happened?  I used to frequent this place two years ago, but something went off the rails.   I can tolerate your ridiculous prices if the quality was the same, but you really slipped.   To start with:  two of your better beers, ‚Ä¶"
49,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was really good! But service not so much. Even tho the waiter was very nice, kitchen mixed up all of our order. I was eating alone while my boyfriend was still waiting cause they forgot to prepare his order!"
50,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Couldn‚Äôt have been more dissapointed.

First of all they gave us an outdated menu. Everything I wanted was on the menu ‚Ä¶"
51,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Very nice decoration. It resembles to New York burger houses, but with a touch of European delicacy. About the food now. Their chicken is amazing!!! Very  nice burgers too and good quality beers! VFM"
52,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Cool Brooklyn style burger bar! I always make a reservation before going. To be honest it was always respected especially if I called the day before. But the food is amazing and the first thing you see when you walk in are the chefs!
53,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"How can you resist to roasted / smoked chicken ?... Quick service, delicious fries and secret sauces. It is advised to reserve before, it can quickly get crowded. Always ask for the Burger of the Month, they usually have really surprising recipes ( caviar, yoghurt sauce... )"
54,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"I really like the efforts made at this place! Big Green Egg, amazing technology with the rotisserie section, really decent burgers. ‚Ä¶"
55,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Really solid smash burger. Would burger again.
56,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very good food! please keep doing what you're doing.
57,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Burger are great. Bread of the birger is perfect and the beef as well. The special french fries adds something. It's a bit dark inside but that's ok.
58,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Everyone's said it, I'll say it again. Best burgers in town. Burgers packed with flavor. Crunchy buns, fresh ingredients. No nonsense service and personnel behind the counter with great knowledge about beers. Go for the Royale with cheese, ‚Ä¶"
59,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this place, you can have great juicy burgers and great side dishes.I love the double dirty and the cheese royale with fried onionsand ""potatos"" (baked potatoes). There is also a long list of other dishes, specially chicken which I ‚Ä¶"
60,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 1 star ,3 years ago,Wanted to try the rotisserie chicken but never got the chance. After 1.5 hours we still hadn't been served despite everyone around us (who arrived after us) receiving their food. We apparently erred by ordering a starter--go figure. In ‚Ä¶
61,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,I think their royale with cheese is probably the best burger in Amsterdam. Rest of the food is decent but the burger really tops everything.
62,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cool place. Sympatic atmosphere where you feel like home. Great food - ribs are top! Beer is very good as well.
63,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I really like the food here, especially the fried chicken. Nice little restaurant, a bit dark but cosy. The only downside is the prices, even though i've been there a couple of times i'm still shocked the cheapest fries option (cheese fries) are ‚Ç¨8,50!"
64,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I really liked this place, it's much bigger than what it looks from the outside. Service was a bit slow but it's kinda normal in Amsterdam. I had a nice burger (by default, comes without fries)"

66,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing chicken. Best in the city. Fast service. Great cocktails.

Dine in service is a little slow but the burgers are well worth the wait.
And the onion rings - crunchy perfection."
68,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is a bit hit and miss. First time we went it was amazing. Second time not so good- brunt chicken, very long wait, main courses arriving 10 minutes apart. Nice selection of drinks."
69,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food is delicious! Hamburger fries were the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. It is pretty expensive though.
70,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very Nice and friendly Stuff - we we're there with our 4 year old in the evening, which was No Problem. I visited Amsterdam as a Tourist but i guess this is one of the best B√ºrgers in Amsterdam."
71,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"By far the best burgers in Amsterdam, eat in, pick up or for delivery. Friendly staff, lively atmosphere and a good selection of drinks for a decent price."
72,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Simple but good food, reasonable prices, nice interior and design and above all, very friendly (and not fake friendly) staff, I was glad to discover the ""Bols Genever"" and have dinner with such a warm atmosphere! Keep it on that way!"
73,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good place with good burgers and fries. Service was very friendly and efficient. Beers selection is pretty good as well.
74,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite places in Amsterdam. Sometimes hard to find a table but the staff is friendly and helps. Only one thing to improve: the French fries.

76,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Food was so so good and the staff were really friendly. Cozy atmosphere with a little outdoor seating if you're lucky! Good cocktails too
77,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"All about the kip here.  Don't bother getting anything else, it's literally in the name! It's so good, you won't be disappointed.  I went with the rather uncouth option of just ripping a half chicken apart with my fingers, but wouldn't do it any other way!  I would come back anytime."
78,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Awesome rotisserie chicken! Great atmosphere, great beers on tap and great fries. Prices are very reasonable. Definitely going back."
79,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good-looking setting, fun party vibe. Expertly done chicken goes down well with a few craft beers. Nothing too fancy, but a fun place to hit up."

97,Rotisserie Amsterdam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,still a good spot to have some dinner. Only the prices are a bit too high compared to the quality and the kind of food you're getting
