1,Caf√© Mokum, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Located at one of the busiest squares in Amsterdam. What a laid back scene here. It was a 1-day visit for us in the city and after visiting the Van Gogh museum, we settle down here for a couple of beer. We ordered Belgian beer and chilled …"
2,Caf√© Mokum, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice pub in the middle of Leidseplein, good food and lots of special beers. Friendly, cozy, I've been warmly welcomed by the crew.

4,Caf√© Mokum, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice terrace with a fireplace, where you can hide from the rain. Located near Apple Store - ideal spot to spend you waiting time :) Salad with goat cheese is damn delicious, same as Queen burger. Still, not that easy to get waiters’ attention, the service could be better. Also long awaiting time (30-40 min)"

6,Caf√© Mokum, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Rude costumer service ruins an otherwise cosy place with an extensive card.
