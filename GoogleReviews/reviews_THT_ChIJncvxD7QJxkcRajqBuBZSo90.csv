0,THT, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice place and nice waiter. The food we had was also great and really ""abordable"" as we say in French!!"
1,THT, 4 stars ,a year ago,The welcoming usher was decent but not so friendly. He told us that there is no table outside arrogantly. The waitress was friendly and kind. I had artichoke and she asked if I want to open it by myself or the kitchen can do it. The restaurant has lots variety of vegan food.
2,THT, 4 stars ,4 months ago,A quick ferry ride from Central. We had drinks outside and enjoyed the view. The restaurant inside was spacious and the food looked good. Will be going back to try it. The waiter was friendly and chatty.
3,THT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"At our final stop in Amsterdam for dinner, we came here after going to the next door lookout. What a gem! The food was amazing and so were the drinks. Staff was extremely helpful on a busy night. If we lived here, we would come all the time. The vibe was incredible. Cheers!"
4,THT, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Small tapas that can be shared with the whole table. Options for vegans and vegetarians as well as a special card for any allergies or intolerances! Food tasted delicious just a bit pricy (estimate around 25€ per person for food and drinks). Close to the ferry.
5,THT, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This is one of me favourite places in Amsterdam. I. Love the ambient, decor and the location. I wish their stuff was less ""moody"", but overoll their moods can't influence my experience, because I really love this spot."
6,THT, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Superb food. One person of the staff not very friendly at the beginning, later improved. Great place to eat for going later to a concert. Paradiso Noord is just round the corner, literally."
7,THT, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I will give them a four just because the food is so fantastic. The service is really a low point for me but I’m happy with my food baby. Highlight was the veggie burger and the curry
8,THT, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Don't get the poke bowl.  Service was nice but slow and inattentive.  Was asked for order without being given a menu.  Asked for regular water with ice because it was so hot and got a tiny bottled water, and charged for it."
9,THT, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Staff slow. The food was average.
10,THT, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful sunny, terrace and hands down the best (friendly, caring, going the extra mile) service I have experienced in Amsterdam. And as cherry on top they made a five star ice cafe!"
11,THT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best hippie places with delicious hapjes in Amsterdam. Very delicious, many options for vegan and vegetarian. …"
12,THT, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Large, quite noisy restaurant, a short ferry trip from the central station. Parking is a struggle. Really a place where you would go with groups I think. Nicely built but I certainly didnt find it a cosy place. Lots of large tables. Food …"
13,THT, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible; egg over cooked: totally hard, hollandaise sauce partly split and no taste of vinegar or lemon juice making it totally flat in taste. The bread and salmon doesn’t work anyway. Table partner got a rotten avocado was taken back to kitchen after which a slightly less rotten avocado arrived. Avoid!"
14,THT, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Lovely place, good food. Especially good for big groups"
15,THT, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Extremely fast service and nice staff. Tasty cocktails.
16,THT, 1 star ,a year ago,"Disappointed. We came there at 16:20h. They said they serve dinner only from 17:30. We waited, ordered a drink. When dinner time approached,  I asked for the dinner menu,  the waitress said we did not reserve, so we cannot have a dinner. …"
17,THT, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Great location. Staff were friendly but definitely forgot about our order. I put it down to lockdown re-opening jitters. Worth a visit to have a beer over looking the IJ if you are visiting as a tourist.
18,THT, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Cool place to have a happy hour with beers and snacks after work.
19,THT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great evening out with friends. The atmosphere and service was great. The food was fantastic! We ordered about 25 dishes in total for 7 people plus drinks, and we were stuffed. In total, only around 30 Euro per person! Some dishes were …"
20,THT, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice food. The servicd could be better. A little bit expensive.
21,THT, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Only 6 months ago the menu was exciting and creative. Adventurous combos of flavours and ingredients from dishes from all around the world made for a great experience. The menu has been changed since then and the dishes are now boring and …
22,THT, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Their concept is sharing dishes, which I really like. We were with a large group and we ordered a lot of dishes, all were very nice and they have a large selection of vegetarian dishes.  They have a great dessert wine. Great place, highly recommended!"
23,THT, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok good views and it's very lively, there's a nice buzz around the place and the staff were very good. Unfortunately the food let it down for me. The concept of the menu is good small portions but a large selection which I like however I …"
24,THT, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place with good atmosphere.  Easy to get from the central station. It tends to be very busy, so sometimes you need wait for the service.  The menu changes with seasons. I really enjoy the food there. We are always coming back."
25,THT, 1 star ,a year ago,"Disgusting finger food and zero customer service! The ran out of one dish that we ordered, so we HAD TO ASK FOR A REFUND, because they forgot. After asking 3 times to get our money back, the manager gave us not the full amount back. Definitely a no go!"
26,THT, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the excellent rijs taffel one day & went back for the traditional pea soup the next. Good food, good service & a nice view into the bargain. They even do a good range of gluten free alternatives as well"

32,THT, 1 star ,3 years ago,Rude. My girlfriend and I wanted to have a drink upstairs with a view. We were told no because we’re not having dinner. It was early (4:30pm) and plenty of tables were open so we didn’t understand why. The hostess was a bit rude and told us to go to the downstairs bar. We decided to just leave and go to another place. Won’t be back.
33,THT, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"From old Shell canteen to food spot. We’re talking about the restaurant of the Tolhuistuin, THT. A spot you go to for a good but simple meal and a view over the IJ. The concept of the place is Tappas Based - the staff is not so friendly and …"
34,THT, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Food was ok but not worth the awful service; I asked to order a beer (in dutch) to which the waiter said of course, then when I proceeded to say the name of the beer (in english); waiter replied ""I can't understand you with your mouth full …"
