8,Sir Hummus, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good humus. I get a medium size bowl and was full. Maybe the fact that there were no unlimited amount of pitta is a bit of a bummer and also no alcohol :( ‚Ä¶
9,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Everytime when we are in the Netherlands, we always try to drop by Sir Hummus as their Hummus is just fantastic. Went there last friday and again it was delicious. Go in the evening as the place wasn't crowded at all unlike lunch time when it is often packed."

11,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love to go here for lunch, because they make delicious humus. Then after I ate there once I stay away for a couple of months, because in my experience there is only so much humus you can eat (even if it's really good)."
12,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was amazing! I got the regular vegan heaven hummus and the flavors were great. I have never had hummus warm, and this being my first hummus outside of the grocery store ones put me in shock at how good hummus can really be. It ‚Ä¶"

22,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"When my wife ordered vegan takeout for out anniversary I was like, whaaa? But then I tried the food and it was awesome. Truly. I had some roll with crispy aubergine in it, I think. And the hummus is addicting. So smooth and hearty. I want some now!"

24,Sir Hummus, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"The staff was super friendly and happy to see us. The food well presented, but it lacked flavors a bit. We chose a meat based dish and there was very little of it. I will give it another go, to see if it was just a one off."

44,Sir Hummus, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The service and atmosphere was nice. The servings are particularly big so if you're not hungry please just go for the small as hummus and bread is definitely filling! The hummus itself is nice but I would prefer the hummus to be room ‚Ä¶
45,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, love the idea of serving hummus with sides. We went for a lunch on a Friday and it was not too busy at the time, so managed to enjoy the food. The toppings are great and all - but I also agree hummus needed some more acid and salt. Please put some lemon juice at the tables :)"
46,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best hummus in Amsterdam! The vibe is perfect and cozy, sharing tables and trays. The small is plenty although we usually need more pita. Try all the spicy sauces if you like some heat :) In lieu of your uncles amazing hummus, this is the best."
47,Sir Hummus, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I just don't get the hype about sitting down to eat hummus. To me hummus is just a topping or something to make my carrots go jolly. If you are a hummus enthusiast and you want to try a restaurant just on hummus and friends, I guess you are ‚Ä¶"
48,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The short menu is in the spirit of ""Do one thing, do it well."" Best or tied for best hummus in Amsterdam. Just think best. Simple dining room, but it's laid back-hip. Very kind staff."
49,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We love good hummus since we went many times to Israel, and this is the place to go for great hummus in Amsterdam. This place makes you feel like you in Tel Aviv, enjoying great hummus in a friendly environment. We go at least 10 times a year."
50,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great hummus, great toppings, and friendly staff!

The hummus is very mild, which fits well with the flavorful toppings and sauces. The limonana I ordered was very nice, too. Overall a very authentic Israeli lunch."
51,Sir Hummus, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Very creamy hummus but be warned it‚Äôs on the bland side (original flavour and all that) so you might want some salt on the side. The toppings are nice and flavoursome but very small portions. Decent lunch place though will be around 10-12 euros/person.
52,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Been eating hummus here regularly since the opening and recently visited Israel, the land of hummus. Ate so much hummus over there and visited the best places that I can say that the hummus here is comparable with one of the best hummus I ‚Ä¶"

We both love hummus, and alternate between making our own and buying from the ‚Ä¶"
54,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of the best hummus places I've been to. Super rich in taste but still light; delicious homemade lemonade and slow cooked pulled  beef for your hummus as topping. Reasonable prices and very nice service as well!
55,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,a year ago,Extremely delicious choice for vegetarian food. Enjoyed all the tastes. Small place... Suitable for 6 person sit. You can take your good away too. Strongly recommend it!
56,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect for a casual eating experience, light, filling, and moderately priced.
The homemade lemonade is the bomb.
Not many places make good lemonades, but they do. ‚Ä¶"
57,Sir Hummus, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly staff. yummy hummous. The pita is fluffy  warm goodness. Very filling. We tried 4 different combinations and they were all good but very similar. our favorite was by far with the eggplant. We all agreed on that. When in doubt i would order less not more as it is so filling. Extra bread instead. Kids liked it too.
58,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best hummus ever! So creamy and tasty! With the warm chickpeas on top... Delicious! I took it with grilled aubergine topping and loved it! Take a ginger beer with it ;)
59,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice spot on the cozy but also bit more quiet square in this overall busy city district.
Serves like the name hints mainly hummus. Concept is simple: select portions ‚Ä¶"
60,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My first-place in 'best hummus places outside of Israel'! You know it's good when you see the tahini lined up by the counter... and the pita and chocolate babka is phenomenal as well. Modestly priced. Go - you won't regret it!
61,Sir Hummus, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good quality hummus, tasty and smooth. Well served, helpful staff. The only vegetables available to eat with the hummus are cucumber, tomato and onion which I don't like and there was no other alternative.
Great bread  as well, decent coffee."
62,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Certainly one of the best places to get hummus with pickles and pita bread. The hummus is warm and very creamy, there are also freshly made cool drinks and definitely try the chili sauces!"

64,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An awesome hummus and a great variety of vegetables you can choose from, all very flavory. I appreciated the fact that there are meat options in the menu. The ""lemonana"" is an incredibly refreshing drink with a mix of flavors we tried to ‚Ä¶"
65,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Closest to the real deal I tasted in The Netherlands
66,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Best hummus in the city. Absolutely a must to take pickled assortie and warm pita.
67,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"yep, google reviews don't lie. Sir Hummus is worth of its stars. It won't be an exaggeration if I say that was the best hummus I've had so far. Hip area, friendly staff and big tables. Love it!"
68,Sir Hummus, 3 stars ,4 years ago,This is good hummus and the pickled vegetables are great!  But is it GREAT hummus?  No.  It could use a bit more acid and flavor.  I think you can get a better spread at the Albert Cupys market.
69,Sir Hummus, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful hummus!
Probably the best you can find in Amsterdam, much better than what you get at the Hummus kampioen or La sud. ‚Ä¶"
70,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely delicious hummus and very kind staff. One of the better meals I had throughout my staff in Amsterdam. Would highly recommend this place to any hummus lover.

72,Sir Hummus, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Hummus based plates. Healthy dishes and very friendly service. The Regular size is quite a lot of food actually. The place could use more starters and a couple of beers.
73,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The friendliest staff! Thank you all, very welcoming environment. Delicious hummus too, I had the carnivore which I highly recommend. I'll be back again, thanks guys!"

75,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the Carnivora. It was absolutely amazing. The pita is warm and soft, the hummus was smooth and delicious, the beef was tender. To die for, must try!"
76,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Probably the best hummus I've had.

Ever. ‚Ä¶"
77,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious and authentic Middle Eastern hummus bar. The hummus is super creamy and all the ingredients are very fresh. Great place to stop for a quick lunch.
78,Sir Hummus, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is OK, but they don't have much options, it really depends on if you like hummus and falafel, cause urs the only plate they have there, or at least the inky vegetarian one, the ser2us pretty fast but the place is very small and has only three small tables, so it really depends on what you like."
79,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love, love, love this place!! Hands down the best hummus anywhere! Vegan or omnivore you cannot visit Amsterdam without stopping here. You will thank me when you do!"
80,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,4 months ago,End up here randomly and I liked it very much!

85,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,3 years ago,There are some places that cannot be properly explained using written words. Sir Hummus is possibly one of those. All you really need to do is submit to the warm welcome and delicious nourishment you will receive here. The rest will take care of itself.
86,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Sir Hummus is a bastion of great middle eastern brunches.
The homemade hummus is excellently tasty, and if you crave meat there is something for you too. Also, please do yourself a favour and try the magic egg!"

89,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Top notch hummus in Amsterdam! The staff is super friendly. You can eat in, or take to go. Seating inside is a bit limited, but there are benches you can sit on to eat, and a standing table at the front window."
90,Sir Hummus, 1 star ,4 years ago,Food is good but service is below the standard in rush hours: they simply forgot about my order. All people behind me already got a food and I was just ignored... thank you for such a great attention! Before I visited this place relatively often but I don't think that I will do it again.

104,Sir Hummus, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Sir Hummus stands out from the crowd because of their ‚Äòcrap-free policy‚Äô. If you thought hummus from your local supermarket was good, you should really head over to Van der Helstplein to check out this healthy hotspot for yourself."
105,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best hummus of my life

109,Sir Hummus, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good food. Make sure to order extra pita. However the hummus does get a bit sloppy towards the end and there is not much dining space.
110,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the hummus. It does not get fresher than this in Holland. The pita bread is an absolute winner.

118,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,6 years ago,They do a great job with houmous. They sometimes do an eggplant special which is delicious. Otherwise go for the beef with a side of egg if you are feeling hungry.
119,Sir Hummus, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good variety of hummus based dishes which are very tasty. Portions are fair, but price is a little above what I'd expect."
120,Sir Hummus, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"To make humus the exact amount of creamy and dense, is a lost artform. Luckily for us, Sir humus employs a few of remanant artisan! Yay!"
