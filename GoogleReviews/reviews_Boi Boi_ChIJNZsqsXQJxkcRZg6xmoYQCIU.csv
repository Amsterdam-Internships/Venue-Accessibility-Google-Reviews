0,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was great, with some standouts.  The pork larb and som thum and Tom kha were exceptional.  The pad Thai was delicious too, great ingredients.  The boi boi appetizer was awesome, that sea seree was the best. …"
1,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,2 months ago,I loved the food. The best noodles I ever had!I think it's a bit pricy but the portion is huge. I paid 14 euro for veggie noodles. All was great and very friendly staff. One star less because it was cold in the restaurant. Worth a visit!
2,Boi Boi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The coconut soup was very nice and the boi boi starter as well but the rest i didn't like that much The tomatoes in my main course tasted bad . The staff was okey but not very friendly. They have a lot of beers in the menu which is nice .Not sure if i would recommend the place or go back.
3,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely place with friendly English-speaking staff. Our food was delicious and there are lots of vegetarian options. The beer menu is huge also!
4,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is easily reachable by public transportation. Food is tasty, reasonably priced  and portions are decent. Fast service and friendly staff."
5,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice and simple Thai food without the fuzz. Staff is great, portions are plentiful. People are always willing to recommend something good."
6,Boi Boi, 1 star ,3 months ago,"The tomyam and tomka kai were very untasty.
Couldnt eat it .
We left."
7,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was great. Cute wooden sort of picknick tables outside. Service was friendly but could have been a bit faster.
8,Boi Boi, 2 stars ,a year ago,I’ve had food multiple times from this place. It was very good at first for a good price but it went wrong somewhere. We got the green curry which is supposed to be spicy but it was’t anymore spicy than a mentos mint. The food tasted very …
9,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious taste, cooked by heart, very nice waiters. Yet beware about your cloth, it will a little bit smelly after it."
10,Boi Boi, 1 star ,a year ago,"Food was OK. But the delivery took 2 hours!
We ordered directly with the restaurant so the delivery person was from there but he did not say sorry or anything. When we called to ask they would just ask us to wait. Definitely not ordering again"
11,Boi Boi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Awful. The food was average at best. The portion sizes were extremely small for the price. Prices are high as well, especially if you want to have meat in your dishes. The service is also bad. We tried to call a waiter over three times but …"
12,Boi Boi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The prices of the dishes at the BoiBoi Take Away location are misleading. Red Curry with beef is in the menu there for € 13,50 and instead of paying for my order there I was asked to pay for it at the main restaurant and I was charged € …"
13,Boi Boi, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice, cozy place with the well known thai dishes. Too had my requests for the spice level was either lost in translation (I don't thik some of the waiters know any thai of even thai food) or just ignored. I told them in thai and in english I wanted my food extremely spicy but there just wasn't any chili in there."
14,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cute and funky restaurant, great food and value for money. Beware: when they say that something is spicy, they mean it!"
15,Boi Boi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff and good atmosphere. However, my ordered meal was not edible as it tasted of chemical fluids. When I asked for a replacement meal, I was directed to email the restaurants website for compensation... In addition, my friends …"
16,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff and good Thai food. I love the Pad Thai here but honestly, quality seems to vary lately. Last time when I took out, I did not find any veggies in the dish unfortunately. Other moments it was stuffed with broccoli and cabbage. I prefer some veggies in a vegetarian Pad Thai :)"
17,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious!
A great little place with tasty food. Gets very busy very quickly so to avoid disappointment book! It has a great buzz but some might find it noisy - I liked …"
18,Boi Boi, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Well, the food wasn't bad but we've had better... The Green Curry was nice just too spicy for me and the Crispy Pad Thai wasn't bad but we didn't love it, didn't know it'd be a little sweet and all fried, and when we payed they just took …"
19,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The spring roll is good. The green curry is pretty authentic (a bit on the more spicy side). While the pad Thai is a little bit too plain. The braised beef is okay. Overall, it’s not the best Thai food from an Asian’s perspective but it is surely above average."
20,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Ordered one of their curries. I believe the lady making it was actually on her break,..but no problem,..with great service and in no time they delivered a nice and spicy delicious curry!
Would certainly recommend."
21,Boi Boi, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The curry was oke everything else was too oily and too sweet. Moreover, seating inside and outside is not very comfy. Outside the benches are made out of steel wire frames without cushions. Inside are primitive wooden benches. Price wise it's very affordable but not super cheap. I'll not be coming back here."
22,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Enjoyed the Pad Thai very much. Service was good once we were able to get a table, Friday night crowd was very big and it took a while for us to be seated, not really a complaint about the restaurant because they don't control how popular …"
23,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great starters. Had the shrimp and the spring roll. We then shared the Thai Steak. Everything was great but our server didn’t add the veggies to the main dish. Good experience.
24,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great little find, fun atmosphere and good food at reasonable prices. I had chicken pad Thai which was a good portion with fresh vegetables and herbs and spices, my other half had green Thai curry and sticky rice which was excellent, tasty …"
25,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This place doesn't leave you scrolling endlessly through pages and pages of dishes on their menu. They serve the staples of Thai food and they do them well. Fast service, nice beer selection, attentive staff. The premises are a bit cramped but this place has never failed to hit the spot."
26,Boi Boi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I'll share an experience I had there on new years eve. A group of friends and I sat down for a meal, everything was ordered off the vegan menu because most of us are. My friends meal had been made with egg and she only noticed after eating …"
27,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place! The Thai here is a cut above. You won't find your usual bottle of sweet chili here, everything made on the premises and authentic. You taste the difference. The vibe is great, cool interior and funky styling. Loved it!"
28,Boi Boi, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Expected much more for the price I paid ( mains and a starter for 66eurs) it all was a bit bland, meat was tough, pad thai was sweet and nothing special. Don't think I'll order again."
29,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Generous, quick and pretty good street thai restaurant of the neighbourhood. It's a pretty big place and there are always a table. Good selection of local beers."
30,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Truly amazing delicious! Definitely best pad thai in Amsterdam! Started of the with boi boi mix platter and as main the best pad thai!
Excellent service by a super sweet thai lady. Left with a happy tummy. One tiny thing no mango sticky rice tho. But didn’t ruined my night!"
31,Boi Boi, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is ok but took quite long time (1 hour) to come a small Tom Kha soup. They get orders to delivery and deliver them first. The dish of my friend was forgotten, I ate alone while he was waiting."
32,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"After a hectic day of walking and seeing Amsterdam on foot, we had few beers at Brouwerij 't IJ and were hunting for a good place to have dinner. We stumbled upon Boi Boi for some Asian cuisine. We ordered vegetarian Pad Thai and Thai Red …"
33,Boi Boi, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Edit: that's a vey long response by the owner. I was pretty clear about what we ordered (I think it was January 3 if it helps any): a Laarb beef (Laarb Neua, which normally costs around 12.50 not 16.50 like here), and a red curry (I can …"
34,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Food was great! The people were very nice. We ordered a type of Thai food that they normally don't serve and they were able to make it! The atmosphere was also very cool 👌
35,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is consistently good! Fried pad-thai is delicious and a must-try. Our personal favourites are the red curry & original pad-thai. Service is okay but it is Amsterdam after all... Otherwise, yum all around!"
36,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Update: So I tried their daily menu again, and this time I would call it delicious! The red curry and the vegetables are well made. I would suggest they improve the rice, which is a bit minced and many grains are not complete. Thai rice …"
37,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to get some Thai food. One of the best in Amsterdam imo. The curries are full of flavor. My favourite is the penang curry.
The ventilation in the place could be better though. When you get out your clothes will smell like curry for days."
38,Boi Boi, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food did not taste good at all!! The fish cakes were burnt, the Pad Thai had a blend taste, the Massaman was thin as soup and and the Penang just was off... And they are expensive too!! Really disappointed."
39,Boi Boi, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Bad experience, and even worse after owner's response.
In reply to your response: why do you try to warp and discredit reviews with fabrications? How does that help anyone? Do you think that everything that goes …"
40,Boi Boi, 2 stars ,2 years ago,We had some pad thai chicken. It was kind of dissapointing and bland. Service was not good either but it might be because it was crowded and they are understaffed. They seem to have a good selection of beers and cocktails..
41,Boi Boi, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff was disoriented. They came all the time when we did not need anything. When we needed something nobody showed up. Food was good, but not as good as in some restaurants in China Town. Prices too high - table was dirty, you don't even …"
42,Boi Boi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The comments below describe quite well the defensive behaviour of the main guy there. I used to love Boi boi, been a returning customer for 2 years, however, the quality has been decreasing and I stopped ordering delivery from them since a …"
43,Boi Boi, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I ordered the crispy pad Thai (invented there) and it was not so good; however, my girlfriends curry was nice. The place is quite noisy. Overall it was ok!"
44,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely Thai food! I had the green curry with squid. Spicy and an authentic feeling. It also has a nice outside area.
45,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Excellent Thai food!
46,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best thai in town for the price! They have some original recipes which are extremely good. The place itself is quite cozy, and has space for small groups"
47,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Exceptionally good Thai food and relaxed atmosphere. I’m a huge fan of Boi Boi and always order the green curry and monkey balls!
The owner and staff are really friendly and welcoming!"
48,Boi Boi, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I like this place. It is fantastic. Lately though, it has become too popular and the dish of the day took like 25 mins to arrive and was a measly portion. But I will return there, its good food on most days. Try not to go there on a Friday evening."
49,Boi Boi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly service and fun Thai food. My appetizers tasted great and had an amazing presentation. Good stop for a snack and beer.
50,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Seems to be more of a local spot and less touristy probably due to the location. Fair prices with tasty authentic Thai food, I had the fish green curry and it was fantastic!"
51,Boi Boi, 1 star ,a year ago,"We just had dinner last night
Was the 3 time we visit
The starters were cold and tasteless …"
52,Boi Boi, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible service: incredibly rude cook and manager. On two occasions they put egg in a vegan dish and didn't want to change it.
53,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Among the best Thai food I've eaten recently. Friendly service and cool untraditional interior. Attracts a young hip urban crowd.
54,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A hipster Thai place? You heard right! Delicious food accompanied by friendly service. Go for the curries, you won't be disappointed."
55,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place - I only tend to review if a place is really really good or really really bad - and this is on the really really good end! Friendly staff, quick service and most importantly, DELICIOUS food. A must try!"
56,Boi Boi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic delicious Thai food, big portions and good price. Very Recommended!"
57,Boi Boi, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Decent food let down by chaotic, incompetent and plain rude service. It took me 10 minutes to get someone's attention for the bill, and even after that my girlfriend was chased down and accused in the street of not paying."

73,Boi Boi, 1 star ,9 months ago,Staff has no idea what they're doing and there seems to be all around little care for customers.
