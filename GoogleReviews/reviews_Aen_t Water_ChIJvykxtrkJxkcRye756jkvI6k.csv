1,Aen't Water, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute place with an interesting concept - you can bring a USB stick and play your own content on one of the 3 table TVs in the back of the bar. Staff was friendly and accommodating, but beer was over priced. ‚Ç¨6.60 for .5L Heineken. Prosecco ‚Ä¶"

9,Aen't Water, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice view from the canal. 13.50 euros for three half pints, including 30 cents more cause don‚Äôt have a Dutch card... pricy place. We were 4, three ordered beers ‚Äî I was told they don‚Äôt give away tap water. Enjoy"

24,Aen't Water, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Quite busy, with an ok view of a canal intersection. No food available at 3 in the afternoon on Saturday when I was here. Asked for beer and the result was Heineken - apparently I don't get to nominate to drink from one of the other taps. Alright I suppose, but definitely not great."
25,Aen't Water, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So many places claim to be the 'best' in Amsterdam, but this really is it, if you want to feel the flavour of the real Amsterdam head inside enjoy the music and a pint of their delicious IPA where you will feel a home from home."
