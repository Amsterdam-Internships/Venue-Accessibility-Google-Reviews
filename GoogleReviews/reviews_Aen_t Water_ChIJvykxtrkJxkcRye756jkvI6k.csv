8,Aen't Water, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely location, especially if it is sunny. The place is very touristic and so are their products and prices. But i guess you need to pay for the spot too ;-)
Sometimes we would come over after a boat trip and have a drink with the group. …"
9,Aen't Water, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice view from the canal. 13.50 euros for three half pints, including 30 cents more cause don’t have a Dutch card... pricy place. We were 4, three ordered beers — I was told they don’t give away tap water. Enjoy"

18,Aen't Water, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had a fun few hours here on Saturday, 26th. Camila told us lots of interesting historical features of Amsterdam, played any music we wanted to hear and made us very welcome. Felt COVID- safe with screens, anti-bac and signing in book.

24,Aen't Water, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Quite busy, with an ok view of a canal intersection. No food available at 3 in the afternoon on Saturday when I was here. Asked for beer and the result was Heineken - apparently I don't get to nominate to drink from one of the other taps. Alright I suppose, but definitely not great."
25,Aen't Water, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So many places claim to be the 'best' in Amsterdam, but this really is it, if you want to feel the flavour of the real Amsterdam head inside enjoy the music and a pint of their delicious IPA where you will feel a home from home."
