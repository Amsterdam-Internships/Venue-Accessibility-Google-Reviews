2,Meatless district, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Super friendly staff. Delicious vegan good!! The menu is not too big which I like very much. I recommend to book a table. Even in a weekday it was quite busy.
3,Meatless district, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The food here is perfect! The place is not so small so you can go there with your family, for a lunch or dinner. It took a long time to prepare our food, but it was worth it! Recommended to visit"

7,Meatless district, 5 stars ,a year ago,"First time vegan cheese platter and it tasted amazing! It was full of flavor. The nut roast was also good! Interesting spices, but still delicious! I'm not even vegan, but I would recommend it to anyone. Small note: waitresses could be nicer."
8,Meatless district, 3 stars ,3 months ago,Mediocre and expensive food. The menu was shorter than expected and even if the food was fine the inexperienced service did not made this place worthy
9,Meatless district, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice place with friendly staff and interesting food. Tried no Chicken sandwich and Pulled Sandwich, all was good.
But Rose Sangria was so soüôà"
10,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"the staff was very kind, friendly and professional. They really follow the customers requests. We didn't wait too long and the dishes were served almost immediately. Wide selection on the menu and everything was vegan. They also have wines ‚Ä¶"
11,Meatless district, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Relaxed atmosphere, nice spacious and light place, awesome options also for alc. free drinks. Loved the 'faux grass'!! Yes, I'm ashamed to say I know how the real stuff tastes and this was definitely taste wise as good (and guilt free!). ‚Ä¶"
12,Meatless district, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Went for my friend her birthday. We loved the food very much, wines + cocktails were good as well. Also appreciated that we could sit outside for a while as well outside of the reservation regulations (we 'booked' from 6.30 pm until 9.30). ‚Ä¶"
13,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had a great meal here today. Was little suspicious as the patty looked like a veg patty. I was pleasantly surprised the cheese burger was delish. One of the best I've had to date. A must try. Service was friendly.
14,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place to sit, eat and chill. All VEGAN.
Cheese Burger was ok, the Pea and mint soup was good the ""Salmon"" bagel was really nice and the Caesar salad was great!! ‚Ä¶"
15,Meatless district, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food and experience! We went with a big group (11 people) and it was amazing. They have a lot of different drinks, very tasty food (I was the only one who was actually vegan but everyone was very impressed) and amazing staff!! Special thanks to yesterday's staff :)"
16,Meatless district, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I've been to their location at Bilderdijkstraat a few times now and every single time it was a lovely experience! The food tastes fresh and is filling, and sometimes I let the bartender pick a drink which always pairs nicely with my meal. ‚Ä¶"
17,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great restaurant we listened to google about the reviews and didn't regret it,
When we walked in we didn't have a reservation big mistake, with google you can also make reservations from within the maps application, then the hostess made ‚Ä¶"
18,Meatless district, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Last weekend I had such a good experience at MD Bilderdijk. The restaurant is located in a nice neighborhood and the interior is lovely!
I had the Faux Gras as a starter and the ultimate no cheeseburger as a main, ‚Ä¶"
19,Meatless district, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the food and the menu. MD has been a bit more imaginative than your average vegan/veggie restaurant. I had the 'Faux Gras' and the Paella. Both were really good. I thought the Paella looked a little ‚Ä¶
20,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love this place. Been there quite a vew times and all times were great. Very good vegan food. Healthy. Fresh. Very very nice staff. Also the kitchen staff is so nice. The owners are so kind and dedicated. Love the interior. Just love love love this place.

22,Meatless district, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice restaurant with plenty of vegan options.

Good ‚Ä¶"
23,Meatless district, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Minimal and industrialized deco, quite creative vegetarian/vegan recipe with beautiful presentation, service is pretty good, price is a bit over average vegetarian restaurants but it worths it. It can get quite crowded, make a reservation to be sure."
24,Meatless district, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Aaaaawesome place for vegan food. The vegan bacon and chicken is unbelievable. Might be a bit more expensive but it tastes really delicious and the restaurant itself is really nicely decorated. The staff was also super nice :) i can only recommend it.
25,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food, cocktail and service. A bit more pricey than average in Amsterdam but totally worth it. The place is lovely as well and nicely designed. Book in advance if possible and if not why not wait at the bar with a cocktail while your table gets available ?"
26,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff and delicious food. Spacious restaurant with several uncommon dishes and a good selection. Drinks are tasty and the atmosphere is, in particular in summer, great. Everything vegan of course. Highly recommendable!"
27,Meatless district, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Incredible vegetarian/vegan restaurant in the center of Amsterdam. I loved everything about this place, from the floor to the lights, the bar the staff or the food. It was a perfect meal on a sunny afternoon! Fresh food,lovely with powerful flavour. I will definitely be back soon.."
28,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for a quick plant-based brunch/snack. The staff was nice and food came super quick. I ordered the Jacktuna sandwich and it was great. If anything I‚Äôd have put it in the oven a bit more.
29,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The MD Cheeseburger was pretty good but don‚Äôt expect fake meat, it‚Äôs more like a veggie patty. The sweet potato fries were also delicious."
30,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's hard to find a vegan restaurant with a romantic, evening setting that is busy but not overly crowded, but this place nailed it. ‚Ä¶"
31,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We ventured to this restaurant within a few hours of arriving in Amsterdam and I am so glad we did! We ended up going back multiple times during our visit because we couldn‚Äôt wait to try more items from the menu. The mushroom benedict was ‚Ä¶
32,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved it. Came unexpectedly and it was full but a lovely waitress ‚Äúpromised‚Äù us a table in half an hour which was there when we came back.

34,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy place but it good as the cost. They know how to cook vegan food with art and love.
We enjoy every dishs in here. ‚Ä¶"
35,Meatless district, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is good. The fake chicken and pulled pork (jack fruit) were well done. Desserts were not that special, the creme br√ªl√©e had still pieces of undissolved flour in it. ‚Ä¶"
36,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Can't get better than this. Even for a meat eater like myself a great place with great service. The gnocchi was amazing. Do not miss this gem when in Amsterdam. Probably the best food I had while visiting Amsterdam. Good and friendly service from the time we arrived and had to wait for a table until we left.
37,Meatless district, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here with my partner today and ordered the benedict, tuna melt, fries and 2 oat lattes. The food was nice but I personally would have preferred the Hollandaise on the benedict to be heated, as well as the spinach wilted. However, the ‚Ä¶"
38,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, pretty small, good size of the menu. Price was a bit high for me, but the food was very good. Quality wise, excellent for a vegan restaurant. This restaurant was my first vegan restaurant that I've ever been to, and I am ‚Ä¶"
39,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The menu here is excellent! Creative use of ingredients and delicious food, all vegan. Nice cozy restaurant, good choice of items on the menu and service is quite good. Its just quite a bit more expensive in comparison to other restaurants. A bit over priced in my opinion but other than that, no complaints!"
40,Meatless district, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is good, but totally overpriced. I had the hummus as a starter which was a good portion at least, but the tortellini were about 3 pieces. Then we both had the steak for 17‚Ç¨ and it was the Vivera steak (which is closer to a burger ‚Ä¶"
41,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The MD team was veeery nice and helpful, food is delicious , i had a salmon sandwich (tasted like real salmon), yummy goulash and avocado wrap. All was amazing! Will definitely come back soon to try out the rest if the menu."
42,Meatless district, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Ok food but high prices. Was expecting a bit more given the price and the hype but was disappointed. Ordered risotto which was too salty. Food presentation was good though so it works for instagramming food pics.
43,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent vegetarian spot. I ordered the fish (soy substitute) & chips and it was the first strong imitation fish I've tried. The flavour and texture was amazing, capturing the flaky texture of an actual cod fillet. Great atmosphere too - ‚Ä¶"
44,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Well the burger is amazing. I love how the whole thing is vegan. Even the cheese. I could eat this everyday. Only remark i could give is that smear of ketchup on my place. Looks 'nice' but not really Nice for eating. The kombucha from yaya is very refreshing
45,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved it! Amazing vegan food, good cocktail options, excellent service and fair price! Definitely recommend if you are looking for a nice dinner spot!"
46,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a Vegan restaurant, they have really nice food! Specially recommend Tagliatelle on the dinner menu üëç"

48,Meatless district, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,The portions are small. We were still hungry after dinner.
49,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Amsterdam, been twice and want to go more. The food is delicious and the coffee and alcohol selection is great. The restaurant itself is beautiful and I love the central bar. Service is super friendly and is always very speedy. Its a must-try when visiting Amsterdam."
50,Meatless district, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The food is really good and quite innovative. For a mid-range price of 12-15‚Ç¨ per main menu item (common for vegan restaurants), you get a top quality vegan burger or curry. I highly recommend trying this out and making a reservation ‚Ä¶"
51,Meatless district, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had a wonderful lunch. Was really filling. Portions big enough. Had to ask for mosterd with my kroketten. Can‚Äôt have kroketten without mosterd. The mayonnaise they give you is blend. Fries are so so. Chai also delicious.
52,Meatless district, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Everything here is tasty. Love the atmosphere: perfect for a romantic date or a cozy get-together with friends. Try the Broccoli Kibbeling and any of the cakes.
53,Meatless district, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super-friendly staff, amazing food. If you go early, it should be okay. In case you go later, I'd advise you to make a reservation :)"

56,Meatless district, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Really enjoyed the food, and good service. The price was fair too."
57,Meatless district, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Food is good, service depends on the waitress that day. Do not trust them when they say something is gluten free, depending on the waitress they say different things and not all check with the kitchen."
58,Meatless district, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We come here regularly because of the tasty and creative dishes! Unfortunately sometimes the dishes don‚Äôt live up to the expectations we have... especially because of the prices. However overall a good atmosphere. If you wanna come for dinner - make a reservation!
59,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food:
Main course - I had a vegan Caesar salad, and it tasted EXACTLY like a good old Caesar salad! I brought some meateaters with me, and they had this shocking ‚Ä¶"
60,Meatless district, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Very rude and disrespectful. The waiter got our orders wrong, looked at us as if we were lying to him. went to the kitchen and came back telling us we were lying. then the right order came and it was super disappointing. it was a ‚Ä¶"
61,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice vegan food and GF also available, well done!! üëç"
62,Meatless district, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good and beautiful vegetarian food in a spacious venue. Would come again. Also good if you have a baby as the place is not too noisy and has ample space.
63,Meatless district, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"I had a Faux Gras and the Cheeseburger & Fries. They were nothing special, I would say average. Also the service was not good when there was almost anyone in the restaurant."
64,Meatless district, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice vegetarian place. Excellent smashed avocado plate, and the broccoli dish was a good main. Left completely full."
65,Meatless district, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The vegan cheese board is wonderful! Everything is nice, the atmosphere is delightful, and the staff are lovely. If you can get a nice seat in the sun out the front the passers-by are great to watch."
66,Meatless district, 1 star ,6 months ago,"We booked a table for 4 p.m. and when we went there they told us that they aren't ready yet so eighter we wait 1/2 hour or go somewhere else.
Why do you even open your restaurant at 4p.m when you aren't ready yet!?!? ü§îüßê"
67,Meatless district, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of my favourite vegan restaurants in Amsterdam. The staff are so kind and friendly and the food is absolutely heavenly! We also visited once during the pandemic & felt very safe- the tables are spaced well, sanitisers readily available ‚Ä¶"
68,Meatless district, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly and quiet, good variety of food and plates. The MD burger is really tasty. Menu is a bit expensive, but a visit is worth, definitely."
69,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, attentive service, wide option of drinks."
70,Meatless district, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Average food for a high price. Not impressed at all. Be careful when the waitress offers ‚Äòsome water‚Äô after you ordered your drinks. They bring bottled water (‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨), although they also serve tap water, which is free. Only plus is the venue itself, could make a nice place if food and service were better."
71,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice atmosphere. The food is very good and service is excellent.
72,Meatless district, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food & friendly service! If you order a dessert you should like cinnamon. Besides that: Main courses were fresh and tasty :)
73,Meatless district, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This restaurant is soo good.
Not a vegan but I could eat here everyday!"
74,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had vegan goulash and Avocado toast and it was amazing! Nice staff and the restaurant is beyond beautiful :)
75,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing vegan food

77,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool space, good food, but considering the hype I kind of expected a more interesting menu. I got the English breakfast"
78,Meatless district, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Delicious vegan food, upscale and good value for money"
79,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good, tasty food that satisfies vegans and non-vegans alike.
It‚Äôs my go-to place for a mixed group, as well as when I want to treat myself.
It‚Äôs a bit pricey but the portion sizes are worth it. ‚Ä¶"
80,Meatless district, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice concept and calm and welcoming atmosphere. The food was good but not very special.
81,Meatless district, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We had the paella and curry, both tasted very good!"
82,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"good menu options, even my meat eating friends loved it, nice staff as well!"
83,Meatless district, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The food was ok, i paid 19.50 Euro for a bowl of brothy soup and some sourdough bread. I can't complain about the taste, it was pretty good, but 19.50 for a (non meat based) soup and bread is pretty rough when you have to pick up a takeaway on your way home because you're still hungry :("
84,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I went there with my husband and daughter this afternoon. Was happy to see that it was pure vegan. We asked the chef if there was any onion or garlic in the dishes as we can‚Äôt eat for religious reasons. He was very helpful, and went through ‚Ä¶"
85,Meatless district, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lots of vegan places popping up, but this one is the real deal. Exceeded every expectation, both in terms of quality and quantity. We ordered for 60 euros for two people and happily ate two days of it ü§©üôÉ"
86,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best vegan restaurant I have ever been to (well impresed by the similarity of the fish and chips!! My son still believes it was real fish! üòÇ). The atmosphere, food and staff were wonderful. I am looking forward to coming back!! We were lucky to find an available table, so if you can book in advance. Highly recommended!"
87,Meatless district, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing food & snacks. We had the fried califlower & sweet fries. Loved the food here.
88,Meatless district, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Overpriced for what it is and unfortunately they had ran out of two of the main dishes on the already quite limited menu. ‚Ä¶
89,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food.  Parppedelle was good, risotto was really good.  Great  service and wine recommendations from the bar"
90,Meatless district, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I had a lovely time here last night. The food is amazjng and there's a lot of choice! Staff was friendly. Fast service, the food took about 10 minutes to arrive at our table after ordering. Definitely try the cheesecake!"
91,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing place for vegan people. Everything is freshly prepared and the ingredients are super fresh and delicious as well. The menu is a bit complicated, as there are different things available during lunch and dinner, but the waitresses ‚Ä¶"
92,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Visiting from the U.S. and this was an incredible meal. My husband and I shared the winter salad starter, butternut squash risotto, lentil and mushroom pie, fries, and apple crumble pie. All were delicious. Can‚Äôt recommend this restaurant enough!"
93,Meatless district, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We tried the hummus, the burger with fries, the risotto with peas and lemon, and the chocolate ganache cake. It was very good! Just the burger had kind of a strange taste and the patty tasted a bit boring and dry. Fries and mayonnaise were ‚Ä¶"

96,Meatless district, 1 star ,5 months ago,Terrible service and unfriendly staff. Food is ok. Save yourself the rude ‚Äòservice‚Äô and order at home.
97,Meatless district, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great quality vegan food. I've been here many times. Sometimes their bar can become a little overwhelmed; each time I have been there, I have had one round of drinks forgotten. They are pleasant when advised and immediate to rectify issue. ‚Ä¶"
98,Meatless district, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good place to eat for vegan or not. Not expansive.

110,Meatless district, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Here is your explanation:

111,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent experience last night ! We had the risotto and the barbacoa bowl and shared the focaccia with a nice bottle of organic wine. They have an open kitchen where you can see the chefs in action. The waitresses were very busy but kept the smile on. Keep some room for the cakes, it's worth it !"
112,Meatless district, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"First I think it's excellent that there is a vegan only restaurant, good work!
I really liked the atmosphere but the big problem they have was service. We sat at the bar whilst our table was being sorted and we were not offered a drink. ‚Ä¶"
113,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great restaurant, it's spacious and beautiful inside, and serving delicious food!

The cheesecake was good but not exceptional."

I had the bagel with no salmon, which was way too salty. All the dishes are also very pricy and not worth the money. One of the biggest dissapointments in Amsterdam."

Warm recommendation to everyone, even the hardcore meat lovers will be pleasantly surprised!;)"
133,Meatless district, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Tried the burger, sunshine bowl and artichoke hummus. Burger was delicious but sunshine bowl was not great, noodles had a very strange slimey texture. Artichoke hummus was ok. Decor is nice. Service was friendly but a bit slow. Not a bad experience, but wouldn't go out of my way to return."

135,Meatless district, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Absolutely amazing food and friendly staff :)
136,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great service. Food was pretty good. We had the barbacoa salad which was delicious and the golden goddess wrap which lacked flavor. Sweet potato fries were excellent. It‚Äôs pretty pricey.

143,Meatless district, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place if you are vegan, vegetarian, and/or gluten free. Highly recommend the AMC (cauliflower tempura). The Sunshine bowl (sweet potato noodle salad) and Caesar salad were also awesome. The veggie burger was ok. Service could be better."

149,Meatless district, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"All vegan restaurant with a nice ambience. Friendly wait staff. The menu could do with a little diversity, but overall enjoyable. For the price, portions could be slightly larger."
150,Meatless district, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very nice atmosphere but way too pricy for what you get. The quality is good but we ordered the Risotto and the Sunshine Bowl and it was more like a Starter. And we are not heavy eaters.
