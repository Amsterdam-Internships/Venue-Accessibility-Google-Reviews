0,Vascobelo V-bar, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice coffee place located in a beautiful bookstore. The staff is very friendly and skilled. The seating is spacious and has a classic and timeless vibe. This Belgium Vascobelo is reachable by elevator or escalator. The machine they use makes amazing coffee.
1,Vascobelo V-bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good caffeteria i side the bookstore. The service is very professional and it is a quiet place in the craziness of Amsterdam. They have a variety of coffees that you can enjoy seated in one of their tables or carrying it through the bookstore. Don't miss the apple strudel.

13,Vascobelo V-bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Young guy helping us yesterday was a sweetheart, but the african american guy behind the counter was very unfriendly, and not for the first time. He does not let you speak up, cuts you off, does not smile or meet your eyes, as if he could not bother with you. Bad experience for the third time with that same guy."
