1,I Kriti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Greek food I've been able to find in Amsterdam! This place is run by a Greek man who is always around and sometimes he plays Greek songs on his guitar. If you like greek food and culture, you should try this place."

7,I Kriti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best greek food in Amsterdam. Incredible taste. After finishing eating you will still have the great taste remained in your mouth and mind. We had greek salad, calamari(squaid), fries, tzatziki, pita, vegan mousaka and icecream. Great price for 2, 48 euro."
8,I Kriti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice little greek rest in quiet neighborhood. Good homemade food for greek expats so taste is genuine. Been there twice in different trips to Amsterdam. Same nice and kind of warm family service.
9,I Kriti, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Warm and fuzzy. Decor, vibe, food quality is a poor comparison of the Greek / Cretan experience. Even the menu was wrong: baked zucchini was served fried. Bad value for the food you get (read, rip off). Sorry not sorry."
10,I Kriti, 2 stars ,2 years ago,It was very lovely when the owner sang and played Greek music. Sadly the food was not as joyfull as the music. It was very plain and not comparable with what you can  actually have in Greece

15,I Kriti, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food with flavors I never had before in a Greek restaurant. Maybe because the chef is from Krete? Friendly staff.
