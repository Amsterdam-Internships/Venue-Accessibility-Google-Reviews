Overall, it was a great experience and l definately will be back for the chili!❤❤❤"
6,Wild Bean Cafe, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Excellent coffee house. Breakfast sandwich (sausage, egg, and cheese on something called a plain bagel )was the worst I ever had in my 70 years. Sausage and egg cooked to oblivion. The bagel was not a bagel but some sort of health bread …"

15,Wild Bean Cafe, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I have been to more than a few coffee shops around this state and I haven’t found any other quite like The Bean. They have great coffee drinks for all seasons and maybe it’s the small town vibes but their employees treat you like a friend.

25,Wild Bean Cafe, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Coffee was very good, food was...a little different, but mostly tasty.

Nice atmosphere and friendly staff."
26,Wild Bean Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stopped here for coffee and ended up adding one of their amazing breakfast burritos to the order. They offer vegan and non-vegan items.  The Wild Bean serves coffee just about any way you like it. Wifi is free if you buy food or drink.

37,Wild Bean Cafe, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Decent coffee, lots of sitting space but the need to pay for wifi was very odd for a coffee shop."
38,Wild Bean Cafe, 2 stars ,2 months ago,Used to love this place.  I stopped in last weekend and they were out of lowfat milk but no big deal. They sold me a bottle of chai mix so I could make my own.  What they didn't say was that they were selling me an open bottle which spilled …
39,Wild Bean Cafe, 3 stars ,7 months ago,For the most part food was good. Didn't have biscuits so ordered toast and gravy the gravy was cold. It took 25 minutes to get a waffle.

73,Wild Bean Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Love the Wild Bean every time I visit! The coconut breve as a Frappuccino is delicious! The only recommendation I would have for the business is to have at least one baby changing station in the bathroom. They have a cute play area for kids but with a group of toddlers it was hard for the parents to change their children’s diaper.
74,Wild Bean Cafe, 5 stars ,a year ago,This is the best place to get coffee in or out of Greenbrier County. Not even Starbucks is as good as their brews. I usually get a mocha frappe and there’s no better frappe than theirs!

89,Wild Bean Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great coffee. Pleasant vibe. Vegetarian friendly in WV. The price of burrito matches its size which is perfect. Get 2 if you are starving.
90,Wild Bean Cafe, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Not too expensive, really yummy drinks! Hot coffee, coffee drinks, fresh fruit smoothies, custom made sodas, fresh coffee beans, YUM! All organic, and to my knowledge, almost entirely LOCAL produce! Wonderful vegetarian food that even meat lovers cant resist! The breakfast wraps, and chili with cornbread are my FAVORITE!"
91,Wild Bean Cafe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The Wild Bean is a unique, local coffee and tea hub with a delightful hipster vibe. Inside, they offer a wide selection of not only coffee and tea, but also vinyl records, fresh coffee beans, CDs featuring local music groups, and a cute …"
92,Wild Bean Cafe, 1 star ,a year ago,"I have no idea how this place is getting good reviews.
