Recommend."
4,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Simple and good reasonably priced bagels. Popular with locals and offer a wide range(yes weed included) range of bagel. Also serve teas and coffees. I would recommend for lunch and brunch. I did find several hairs in my bagel but the staff were extremely apologetic and I would eat there again.
5,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"What can I say, they made the plain bagel meal so so good. I had the Smoked chicken bagel with basil dressing, avocado and pine nuts and it was magnificent.  Highly recommend if you visit Amsterdam."

7,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super delicious bagels! I tried 4-5 of them and all were excellent. Don't miss the tea menu, get my favorite Chai Mogli to seal the experience that makes you feel good from the inside. Very friendly and prompt service too. If you are out on a museum day, highly recommend this place for coffee and snack breaks!"

9,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,a year ago,Bigger cappuccino was sooo big and so creamy! Delicious. But chai latte was totally different than I’ve ever drink and actually I didn’t like it. Staff was helpful and really nice.

11,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,a year ago,"I usually like this place but the two last times I went there to buy a porridge have been terrible a terrible idea. Last time was un-eatable so I had to throw it away (as hard as cement, my colleagues were actually making jokes) and this …"

21,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a great place to have breakfast or brunch! The bagels are delicious and the place is cozy!!

45,Bagel & Beans, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Bagels were very delicious. Nice atmosphere and supportive staff. The only disappointment was the banana bread.

49,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,a year ago,"I been at least 10 different Bagels&Beans and I was happy with them until this one. They are extremely rude and they do not like tourists I guess. I went there with my friend, we ate and drink coffee but at the end we wanted to pay the bill …"
50,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favorite places where I ate in Amsterdam.

53,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I went for the afternoon tea, the avocado in  cream cheese bagel looks quite off. The avocado definitely has been ripped for a few days since I eat avocado on the daily basis. The tea was quite refreshing.   Overall is quite relaxing experience."

56,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Coffee does not taste good, way too bitter. You have to wait very long to be served and then wait again to just pay your bill... The lunchroom itself is very rowdy. Pecan pie however, is good and gluten free."

Good and drinks were good. …"
58,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If you are looking for a real New York bagel, this ain't it. Overpriced and very mediocre. What ticked me off the most, was very slow and rude staff (we waited 30 minutes for a plain toasted bagel, no apology, didn't bring the check when I …"

60,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My mom, sister and I ate here three times for breakfast for the week we were visiting Amsterdam.

63,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I was super happy to find a place with a vegan option. It did take us a while to get served because of how busy they were. And they gave our waters to the wrong table but that was eventually sorted out. I was not particularly happy w the …

Claim certain bagels are only served for breakfast - but the menu doesn't state …"
65,Bagel & Beans, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The server was being rude to us and yelling at us while she was being extremely kind to others. Racism at its best. Giving a 2 and not 1 because the bagel tasted good, although wasn’t worth the wait we had to sit through unlike other people."
66,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"AMAZING bagels--and we are very picky, being used to New England quality bagels. Toppings are generous and very fresh, coffee and oolong tea were delicious, and the staff was super friendly. Strong WiFi, kinda busy. Well behaved dogs allowed inside. Love it."

69,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Quick breakfast place with indoor seating, the coffee is good but the place can get a little crowded so be prepared to wait even though they had 5 people working. For some reason there were a lot of bumble bees inside which seemed like a natural occurance since the waitstaff had an electric fly swatter!"

71,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Usually, I don’t write any bad reviews even if the service is bad. But upon stepping into the cafe, the waitress told us that they are full and have to wait around thirty minutes so she told us to find another cafe. …"

73,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Coffee very strong but smooth. Service very fast. We didn't eat but food did look lovely.  Toilet is up a very very steep staircase that twists, going up ok but made me dizzy coming down.."
74,Bagel & Beans, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Bagel was very nice but the SECOND time i went up there to go over my order i asked for butter and this was still not put into my bagel.

79,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very slow service, and the staff has a loud way of working. We waited for 10 minutes for someone to take the order...
The food was ok but not extraordinary, cappuccino the same.
No soap at the toilet, quite dirty."
80,Bagel & Beans, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food & drinks are good however the service and ordering is chaotic and stressful. Considering they offer vegan options I thought they would try and accommodate my order easy (bagel, extra veg, avocado) but made several rude remarks while ordering."
81,Bagel & Beans, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Food is very good. Position in the centre of Amsterdam. Ambient is not very well-finished. Prices expansive for Italians but not expansive for the food-standards of the city! …

85,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Sent the wrong food. Slow service and not apologetic about the error - in fact said it was my fault for miscommunication and that ""next time, you have to pay"". There won't be a next time, shame. I'd avoid."

97,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Tasty as always, BUT, horrible noise coming from the 'neighbors' who were drilling NON STOP,  making our visit nerve wracking instead if the relaxed breakfast we were hoping for.  Staff said it started in April 2018 and would continue until January 2019."
98,Bagel & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Went here for a quick brunch before checking out the Van Gogh museum and it was great! It’s also really close to the museums so you can easily walk over afterward.
99,Bagel & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst bagels and beans cafe out of all. The head server/owner is grumpy. There are a lot of tourists coming in because it is a central location and in museum quarter. It is not comfy to sit here and drink/eat something.
