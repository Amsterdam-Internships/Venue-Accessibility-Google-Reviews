1,Song Kwae, 3 stars ,3 years ago,3.5 stars pretty good and ok but somewhat modified so its a mixture of thai and chinese?? Lacking the stronger herbs and flavors like authentic thai though one dish was super spicy for some reason. My padthai was ok but too sweet for my ‚Ä¶
2,Song Kwae, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I came to this place for a second time. The first time I didn't even recognize the food as Thai. Looked more Chinese than anything. This time I was less adventurous on my choices (chicken sate, sweet and sour fish, sticky rice with mango). ‚Ä¶"
3,Song Kwae, 4 stars ,3 years ago,They offer a wide range of very tasty and well spiced food. The prices are fair and relatively average for Amsterdam centre. The place feels rather cold and unfriendly at times. ‚Ä¶

15,Song Kwae, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I felt compelled to leave this review after tasting Thai food in Germany a couple of days after Amsterdam. You don't realize how good and spicy (hits-the-spot) the curry is until you compare it to mediocre Thai fare elsewhere. Green curry is particularly good and massaman is also very nice

17,Song Kwae, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Smaller portions than other thai places. Pad thai was greasy but had a good taste, green curry with chicken was not good. Definitely many other better places in Amsterdam."

21,Song Kwae, 1 star ,11 years ago,"We were looking for a nice Thai food restaurant and were greatly disappointed with this one. You are going to regret to spend every penny in this place.
We ate a soup (tom yam kai) and it tasted like from a can. I love Asian soups ‚Ä¶"
22,Song Kwae, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I Am really disappointed. We ware a group of friends who ate here but when we wanted to pay we ware NOT allowed to pay for ourselves, we had to pay in 1 amount. The lady said she did not have time and she was frustrated and angry with us. ‚Ä¶"
23,Song Kwae, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had the #1 soup which was very good. Perfect amount of spice with 2 large shrimps. The #43 fried rice was average on the spicy side.  I would recommend eating here.
24,Song Kwae, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Pad Thai and spring rolls were delicious and satisfying. If you are looking for some Thai food when visiting Amsterdam while taking in the cafe life- this is a great place to do it. It is located near Nieumarkt and the red light district.
25,Song Kwae, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It was a rainy night and for a time, I was the only patron. I had an ample portion of lovely coconut ginger chicken soup, rice and tea. I would definitely go back for Thai."
26,Song Kwae, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I ate here many years ago (2006) and I still remember how great the food was. Out of the 4 days I spend in Amsterdam I ate here twice. Of all the 5 months I spend in europe this restaurant is one of the meals I remember most. It was just so ‚Ä¶
27,Song Kwae, 1 star ,2 years ago,Worst food and worst service ever! I even witness restaurant staff negating access to the toilet to a little girl (maybe 5y.o) as they thought she wasn‚Äôt a restaurant guest! Very inhuman! They firstly mentioned ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have toilet in this ‚Ä¶
28,Song Kwae, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Definitely one of top Thai places in amsterdam. I've been in Thailand many times and this food is authentic. Giving 4 stars as prices are higher then rest Thai places.
29,Song Kwae, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I have been coming here 4 years and it's absolutely authentic Thai Food...I have seen other comments and I do not agree and I have been to Taiwan, Thailand and Japan so I think I would know how good Asian food would taste like."

31,Song Kwae, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Simple and clean looking place. Food was good. A bit expensive though. 14‚Ç¨ for a standard chicken with rice, nuts and vegs plus the usual 2‚Ç¨ for water. The free WiFi requires Facebook login (social Hotspot) which allows for data collection."
32,Song Kwae, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Honestly, I am trying to criticise it as an Asian. Food are okay, I think it would sacrifice most of westerners but definitely not even close for Asian.
I suggested that should add iced coconut milk into menu and some related drink ‚Ä¶"
