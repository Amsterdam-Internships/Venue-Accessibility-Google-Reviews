1,Casablanca, 1 star ,a month ago,"Just passed by this place today and had to remember a terrible experience about 7 years ago (yes, it was that bad that I still remember). Do yourself a favour and don't even set a foot here."
2,Casablanca, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a beautiful bar and they offer karaoke but not really the athmosphere I expected, at least  when I was there. It could have been better, more attractive to the costumer. Probably much better any other day."
3,Casablanca, 3 stars ,a week ago,Karaoke at its best.  The main guy is fantastic
4,Casablanca, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I'm reading at a five-star although I don't think you should go there. I'm only because I want it to be available when I come through town and went to go myself. There are points in time when the bar is too full to invite any others inside. …

11,Casablanca, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Always way too crowded, and the way the speakers are set up means if you're stuck in the wrong spot they're right in your ears. If you're a club type person it's probably fine, but for a quieter person this place is a bit much."
12,Casablanca, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Gives perception of closed place for locals. They have really limited set of songs, most of which are quite old. Surprisingly quality of sound is so much better than in any other karaoke I've been in Amsterdam."
13,Casablanca, 1 star ,5 years ago,The staff of this bar should really work on their basic skills of being friendly to customers. That was the worst experience I ever had since I live in this city. We were treated as if we were a bunch of totally drunk idiots. Mean and …

18,Casablanca, 1 star ,5 years ago,This bar really doesn't worth your time..Except the fact that there is no heating in the bar one of the microphones was broken. Furthermore we were the only customers during that night and the manager/ bartender was really reallyyyy rude! I …
19,Casablanca, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Bad experience, went with my group of friends and the owner was very rude to us as well as the bartender. We ended up going to the end karaoke around the corner, muuuch better experience."
20,Casablanca, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Incredibly bad experience, the bouncer took my bag and wanted to charge me 2 eur. He then threatened me that he would forcefully remove me while I was looking for my route home on maps. I will not return on principal."
21,Casablanca, 2 stars ,5 years ago,This place could be where I want to spend every weekend. However the workers are unbelievably rude. The person looking up the music was extremely rude. If the staff situation changed I might be moe inclined to go back and enjoy the music and karaoke.
22,Casablanca, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Way too crowded and practically impossible to get a place in line to sing. Maybe on a weekday it'd be more accessible, but don't show up on a Saturday evening and expect to sing and be able to move around."
23,Casablanca, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The man behind the bar was extremely rude for no reason, we wanted to do some kareoke but instead he he only helped other people. Will never visit this place again, such a tacky bar!"

25,Casablanca, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Smack in the middle of the red light district there's a small bar which gives you the possibility to sing horribly to the lyrics of the song you please. Juet don't think when you pick a song you'll be singing it to all the people within 15min. Everbody wants to sing and has a specific wish. Don't expect you tp be in front of them
26,Casablanca, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nearly as good as a film, the Guy behind the bar smiled at me, but people who were singing have such a horrible voice. Not sure if i Will be coming back again."
27,Casablanca, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Gresr karaoke,but if you don't buy drinks they will kick you out. Get around midnight for it to be good."
