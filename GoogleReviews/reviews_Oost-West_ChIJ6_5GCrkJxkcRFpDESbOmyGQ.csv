0,Oost-West, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Expensive but well worth it. Bartender Basil was talkative, friendly and had a great sense of humour. Beer was cold, crisp and delicious. Jaeger shots cold too. Basil's dinner arrived when we were there and he gave us a slice of the pizza upon enquiring what the topping was. If only it was za'atar!"
1,Oost-West, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not a bad bar, but not great.

Interesting sense of humour on the bartender. If I order a La Chouffe (strong beer) for my wife, don’t ask if she is pregnant...."
2,Oost-West, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Made to feel uncomfortable from the moment we walked through the door. Barman had a real bad attitude and was being quite aggressive, we got the feeling that he didnt like Americans or the British as every comment seemed to be about western countries invading the middle east. Bizarre and quite worrying"
