0,Weesper, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The terrace view and the fried eggs are just perfect. Its a perfect spot to meet your friends and catch up. Can be super crowded in the weekend and on the sunshine(summer days). There are trees around and boats passing one of the few places in ams that has that urban nature combination. Love it every time.
1,Weesper, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice brunch, eggs benedict were great"
2,Weesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A great place to eat, drink, and chill outdoors. One of my favorite places in Amsterdam simply because the service was great and the food was served efficiently. I ordered roasted pumpkin, cheeseburger, beef carpaccio, gespacho, and roasted cabbage salad. All really tasty 👌 Definitely coming back!"
3,Weesper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A really good pub for a lunch or dinner. I recommend this spot as it's got great views and the foods good pub quality; just the right type to relax and enjoy the beer on tap.
4,Weesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice atmosphere and food. Rather big bar with several tables. Friendly and fast service. Good drink selection and tasty food. Portion sizes are rather small with a big price, but it’s worth it. Usually quite busy and popular. Good choice for after work drinks and borrels! Close to the Amstel metro station, so easy to reach."
5,Weesper, 1 star ,6 months ago,Worst bar I've visited in Amsterdam in 6 months. Arrived tonight and waited for 20 minutes outside thinking there would be table service. Went inside and asked could I order a drink. Rude and condensending girl said her colleague would …
6,Weesper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Honestly a really nice outgoing informal bar. Great for group drinks with colleagues or friends. Service is great and the place has a nice terrace with a canal view and it's well situated
7,Weesper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great location for a drink or breakfast. Good coffee and egg Benedict. Croissants are the frozen type and not so moist and crisp.
8,Weesper, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely little restaurant in East, good food and wine, lovely setting. Great for groups! We enjoyed our team outing dinner."
9,Weesper, 1 star ,a year ago,Bad service. We had drinks with the big group and eventually were charged for many cocktails twice. There was a mistake on Weesper’s side but there was no possibility for a reasonable conversation where the bartenders did not accept our …
10,Weesper, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really cool vibe, and great drinks!"
11,Weesper, 1 star ,11 months ago,"Sells bottles of beer without opening them, and suggests asking other customers for an opener (not exactly corona proof is it?). Then refuses to give a refund. When asking for hand sanitizer, you get a funny look as though you're a crazy …"
12,Weesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food and good service, go for the Catch of the day on the menu..."
13,Weesper, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Been there twice. First one was for dinner, service was super fast and nice. Lovely staff and delicious food. Second one was for lunch. Unfortunately, service was tooooo slow. It took us almost an hour from the moment we sat and started eating our food. And place was not that crowded at all. Also, lunch portions were really small."
14,Weesper, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Service is very bad. There was basically no service on Sunday morning, 21 July. I had to order myself at the bar. The only guy who was there with short curly haircut seemed not to be awake yet, as he didn’t understand that I want breakfast …"
15,Weesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Informal atmosphere for this bar/café, really cosy. They have a pretty big outdoor seating area. They serve classic food from bar, like burgers, but everything is classy and well prepared. Their wine selection is quite big compared to other bars of the area."
16,Weesper, 2 stars ,a year ago,Service on the terrace is very very slow and also not very friendly.  Food is ok but not great. Also not open to make small changes to a dish. I would not recommend it to my friends despite the great location.
17,Weesper, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Outside terrace near the water is great, but crowded if you land there for a spot around 16PM, when the sun is shining bright on a Friday :) Nevertheless, great spot for Friday afternoon drinks. My friend and I started on the terrace and …"
18,Weesper, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice terras, nice food. But staff tends to forget things.  They forgot that we would have wanted to order desert,  forgot to bring tea (we were left with hot water) and they forgot that someone who left early had already payed part of the bill."
19,Weesper, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Converted from a posh restaurant to a more trendy place but not overly hipster. Attracts kind people, not overrun by tourists. Beautiful wine/beer cellar with wooden finish. Food is at par. Semifreddo was completely frozen for example but overall it tasted good."
20,Weesper, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great place for a drink and a bite!
21,Weesper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly staff. Good place for afterwork drinks. Nice atmosphere. Music not too loud. Did not try the food this time but remember it was quiet well from previous visit.
22,Weesper, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Cosy, friendly and great wine list."
23,Weesper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A great place in the winter months for a cosy wijn, late night snack and beer with friends -  they offer a lekker food menu if you want a treat. We loved the unusual Brussel sprouts with soya sauce."
24,Weesper, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The place was nice, we had dinner inside. But, the price/performance rate was very low. Portions were small according to price. They have charged even for tab water!"
25,Weesper, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good place for food, drinks or borrel. It is usually packed. The meat is good, I was surprised that they did not ask how cooked I wanted the steak. Conveniently located close to Amstel station and next to the river."
26,Weesper, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Its an ok spot. Only thing was when I was alone I was completely ignored. Sat there for over 20min, when my friend arrived I did get served. I wont come back even though the food was nice."
27,Weesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a couple of drinks here and let me just say, they were so drinky."
28,Weesper, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice bar in it's old style, giving it a authentic atmosphere. Many different beers and hard working personnel. Popular place when the sun is out!"
29,Weesper, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good menu and good food but the service usually lacks in this place, but hey, it's still Amsterdam, good service is hard to find nowadays. …"
30,Weesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy inside and chill spot looking onto the Amstel outside. Nice cocktails, attentive service while not pressuring you to keep ordering drinks."
31,Weesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cosy and friendly service. You can find many different types of beers. It's really enyojable to sit outside next to canal but service is slower if you are sitting outside.
32,Weesper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fine restaurant with nice staff. Menu with dominantly meat dishes, but some veggies too.
Very cosy."
