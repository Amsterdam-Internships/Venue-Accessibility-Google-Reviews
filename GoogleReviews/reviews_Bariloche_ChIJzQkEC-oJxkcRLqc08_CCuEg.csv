0,Bariloche, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"We enjoyed the food so much. Pictured are the filet steak and the lamb, they were all very much to our liking. Also, the 'eggcelent' burger was great. Staff was very friendly, would definitely recommend."
1,Bariloche, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Really mixed experience at Bariloche. We had the chicken burger with fries and chicken fajita. For some reason, the burger came with half of the ingredients missing. It ended up being just 2 buns, chicken breast and lettuce. We had to ask ‚Ä¶"

9,Bariloche, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Good argentinian restaurant, good meat, super sides and sauces. Not 5 star for the lack of desserts. Normal prices for Amsterdam city center, maybe a little bit cheaper"
10,Bariloche, 1 star ,3 months ago,"We have eaten in many bad restaurants in Amsterdam but this one was the worst. The cocktails were not tasty (too sweety and no alcohol), the chicken was BURNT, not just grilled : it REALLY tasted like burnt wood. ‚Ä¶"
11,Bariloche, 1 star ,4 months ago,Went here as a second option. Overpriced and poor service. Waiter almost got into a verbal argument with table and was arguing with the kitchen in front of everyone. Felt like Gordon Ramsey was going to come out for an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.

17,Bariloche, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Service was allright but not all to best. Fries weren't cooked all the way although the burger was good.
18,Bariloche, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"If your looking for a quick bite in a great ambiance in one of Amsterdam famous streets Reguliersdwarsstraat you should take a seat on the terrace.

30,Bariloche, 3 stars ,a year ago,Steak was good but it was the WORST JACKED POTATO in my entire life! It was old and soaky wet and even had the strange color! Think I am not going to visit the place where I buy old disgusting potato for 4 euro. Sorry.
31,Bariloche, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Slow but friendly service, soup too salty to eat, WC is an utter disaster"

39,Bariloche, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Steak was excellent, but the restaurant smelt a little like freshly painted inside"
40,Bariloche, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I think my experience was an exception because it was Kings Day. They were out of tortillas so they couldn't make both of the items I wanted to order. I ordered a hamburger by default. The meat was high quality. It was more like a home made ‚Ä¶

45,Bariloche, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Ok food, but terrible service. I shouldn‚Äôt be able to think about and post a review while waiting for a check.  It‚Äôs been ten minutes since the waiter was in the dining area, and there‚Äôs 4 tables in use. ‚Ä¶"
46,Bariloche, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I ordered steak and an oven potato. Both were only Luke warm. The steak was good quality but had very little sauce and tge potato didn't even come with sourcream. Too expensive for the quality
47,Bariloche, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Last night I ordered  your food for the first time (via Uber) and was positively surprised how good it was for a food delivery. The gambas very super. The baked potato with sour cream as well and the grilled mais also. The nachos were ok. ‚Ä¶
48,Bariloche, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and cozy place. The food is good and not pricy. The staff is very friendly and fast. I can recommend their steaks. Me and my friend had the Carpaccio as starter and then the steaks. Very good!
49,Bariloche, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Frozen chips and a distinctly average burger.  Not too expensive so it's hard to be so negative, other than chains like gmbk produce a much better meal for less.  I would advise avoid."
50,Bariloche, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Overpriced tourist trap, when you see no tipical argentinian meat cut wise people turns away, we didn't and we hope our sacrifice at least serve someone as cautionary  tale. Run, this is no argentian, not even broad latino, restaurant. And quality is shameful"
51,Bariloche, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I must say, I couldn't be more happy after eating at this restaurant. It is located next to the bloemenmarkt and the street is not always really busy, we decided to have some steak instead of pizza. ‚Ä¶"
52,Bariloche, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had some Burgers with fries. These were great and the Staff was very friendly. Prices for drinks are a shame - as in most parts of Amsterdam.
