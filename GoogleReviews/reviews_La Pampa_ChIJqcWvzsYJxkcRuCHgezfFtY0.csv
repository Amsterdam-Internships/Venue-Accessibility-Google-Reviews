0,La Pampa, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Four years in a row; still coming back.

Food is good quality and usually pretty quick; staff friendly. ‚Ä¶"
1,La Pampa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place with fast service and delicious meals, for example this grilled chicken was lip-licking. Comfortable too, with friendly staff. Would recommend, and it's really close to the Dam Square."
2,La Pampa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful food at great prices, good service, and a delightful romantic experience. My wife and I enjoyed it immensely in our first visit to Amsterdam and I returned to be even more delighted by the wonderful live music and great view of City center"
3,La Pampa, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food tasted good but we ordered two fillet steaks and were clearly not given fillet. The waiter presented us our rump steaks, declaring they were indeed fillet. The meal was rescued by the meat being high quality. Won't be going back in a hurry. ¬£55 for two overcooked rump steaks isn't good value."
4,La Pampa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great steaks. Warm welcome. Nice people
5,La Pampa, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing place. Cheap and delicious food, but the main thing is, this place is very warm. People, live music etc. Amazing staff and good food. There are menus with food combos so you can choose a menu with a lot of food, mostly 17-18 euro ‚Ä¶"
6,La Pampa, 5 stars ,4 years ago,So good I ate here three times in a week. Friendly staff and efficient service. The steak is excellent and was perfectly cooked to my liking. I highly recommend their caramel pancakes! ‚Ä¶
7,La Pampa, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The food was ok, nothing exceptional but decent. The prices are normal too, according to the location of the restaurant and the average prices in Amsterdam. One of the waiters were a bit rude but altogether it was a positive experience"
8,La Pampa, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We were there last week. The food was amazing, the waiters perfect, price reasonable but... Suddenly the owner start a fight in the back with his employees and he ruined the moment for my family and myself. That kind of behavior, screaming ‚Ä¶"
9,La Pampa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant is really beautiful and cosy. The food is just delicious, I have never eaten such good meat !
I just remove a star because the chips are not craft.
The staff is friendly."
10,La Pampa, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Absolutely not worth the price! Typical tourist trap! Food was just average, proportions were small, service was terrible (yes, waiters were very friendly to welcome us in, but took ages to serve us!). Wasted 2+ hours and almost 60 EUR ‚Ä¶"

15,La Pampa, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff was friendly, the food was AWESOME! Had the empinadas and mushrooms, then had the ribeye with mushroom sauce - the steak was cooked perfectly, and it was juicy and delicious. Had a great experience at this restaurant!"
16,La Pampa, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food was very good. Nice clean and reasonable prices place to eat a solid meal in Amsterdam. Only reason for such a low rating is the staff are moody and misserible.  With better friendly welcoming staff this would of been a 4 star rating. Shame shame shame shame
17,La Pampa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Meat was very good (suggest Lomo A La Piemen), a very nice Argentina wine ( Cabernet Sauvignon - Melodias Trapiche). Not busy place at the time of our visit, 11 Jan 2020)"
18,La Pampa, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredibly overpriced for 'meh - okay' food. 'Large' (it wasnt) drink for 5,90 euros. ‚Ä¶"
19,La Pampa, 1 star ,2 years ago,This place gave me food poisoning for days. Only just recovering from Sunday  Their starter 'chorizo' was actually just a cumberland sausage. The steak was also cold and they charged me 75 euros.
20,La Pampa, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Order hot tea for 2.50 and asked if hot water refill was possible and was told yes. When asked for refill, only then was told 3 Euro charge... more expensive then ordering a new cup... ‚Ä¶"

23,La Pampa, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Veeeeeeeeeeery  bad. When we came, we got menu so we can choose what dish we want to eat, after every two minutes the waitres were coming to ask if we choosed already, when they came for 10 times already, we decided to take salmon menu, ‚Ä¶"
24,La Pampa, 3 stars ,5 years ago,I liked the ambience and that was the reason for me to have lunch here. It's very close to wax museum. The staff is very friendly and can understand English. I tried fish steak and it was quite average in taste.
25,La Pampa, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Never been to a worse restaurant. To begin with the toilets smell like the dixies on a festival, with a slight touch of lavender air freshener.
The entree was marinated chicken wings. They were not marinated, burnt and there ‚Ä¶"
26,La Pampa, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food came out on cold plates so it went cold very quickly. There was a cat walking around the kitchen as well when I was going to the toilet not something you want to see. Overall quality of the food was poor
27,La Pampa, 1 star ,10 years ago,"This is one of the places in Amsterdam you should actually try to avoid. When I ordered my steak, all I got was a sinewy piece of crap. The drinks also largely concist of ice instead of what you really ordered, and the service is a no-go. ‚Ä¶"
28,La Pampa, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Expected nothing and got Less. Terrible food, chicken breast was raw and food is definetly overpriced. Service Not good. Got convenience schnitzel that was fried. Never Ate so Bad in my whole life.  Never again."
29,La Pampa, 1 star ,3 years ago,Nice music and cosy interior but rude owner and misleading billing. Was told to order two sides and sauce with our dishes only to find out each were charged separately on the bill.
30,La Pampa, 1 star ,2 years ago,"WORST RESTAURANT EVER!!!!

On November 16 at night, around 10 pm, I went to dinner with a group of friends ‚Ä¶"
31,La Pampa, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was ok, but when we got the place half of the men√π wasn't available, but the most expensive dishes. Staff is multilanguage but a bit forgetful."
32,La Pampa, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Undercooked chicken for starter.
'Home-made' bread had actually been warmed in a microwave, turning it into an un-tearable brick. Asked for fresh and got the same again.
Over cooked chicken for main and grisly steak. Would NOT go again."
33,La Pampa, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Best meal we had in Amsterdam.  Sometimes traveling,  you crave meat,  and this is the place.  The host seemed a bit grumpy,  but this is staid Netherlands."
34,La Pampa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good steak.
I come here twice in one week 3 years ago.
I am here again twice a week.
The singers make the steak even better....üëç"
35,La Pampa, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Service waa not good - quite rushed and not personal (not customer friendly at all). Would not swap chips to a baked potato. Food was generally overcooked. Overall we would not eat here again.

38,La Pampa, 1 star ,5 years ago,Overpriced food served by disinterested staff. The steak was very poor quality and I am not even sure if it came from a cow. Just a tourist rip-off
39,La Pampa, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is really weird in this restaurant, however, the steak and the pasta was tasty and worth it. The dishes were served quick"
40,La Pampa, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Price averaged 25‚Ç¨	a person but for this value the food was good and the service was also nice. It's also very cozy and the food was cooked very fast. Bathroom was a bit disgusting though.
