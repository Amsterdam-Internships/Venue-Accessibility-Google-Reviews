0,Caf√© de Hartjes, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A sweet, laid-back little pub with a friendly vibe and terrific service. Located off-the-beaten-path in Amsterdam, near Amsterdam Centraal Station and just outside the red light district. If you're hungry, order in a bite from Mr. Meatball just 2 doors down. Definitely worth spending a drink or two."
1,Caf√© de Hartjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The atmosphere seems stuffy when you first walk in but this place has a heart of gold. Staff was super friendly and the mixed drinks were superb. All genres of music played in the background and you could have a conversation without yelling. Dancing was encouraged and inside or out there was a friendly and inviting vibe.
2,Caf√© de Hartjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stopped in for a cup of tea to warm up. We knew it was a bar, but we were a bit wary of ""coffee shops"". Lovely friendly lady behind the bar, knew we were English so didn't mind us ordering tea!! Lovely friendly atmosphere. Great place to warm up in a long cold day of walking everywhere."
3,Caf√© de Hartjes, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pleasant sitting outside on a rare warm February afternoon, enjoying a beer in the sun. We ordered the homemade meatballs, which were really tasty like in a homemade style. Service was very good too, nice little place."
4,Caf√© de Hartjes, 1 star ,3 years ago,"What a horrible little establishment. Visited last week, hadn’t even found a table before the rude barwoman kicked my two friends out because they didn’t know what they wanted to drink. …"
5,Caf√© de Hartjes, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"2*, not 1 because of the cosy atmosphere and friendly staff.
We asked for a pitcher of beer; as we are not used to US measures and there was no volume and/or price marked on the drink menu, we asked the lady how big it …"
6,Caf√© de Hartjes, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible experience. Took 30 minutes for someone to come take our order. Waitress was drunk and very rude. When we decided to get up and leave instead of ordering she shouted and swore at us down the street. Not sure how this place continues to exist with staff like this.
7,Caf√© de Hartjes, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Super nice staff. Went there for a live game. TV is too small for the whole bar and not visible from every angle, regardless of it being a small pub. Could do with an extra TV for these kinds of things."
8,Caf√© de Hartjes, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Felt terrible there. Don't go there if you are from Serbia. I was sitting there with my wife and 16 year old daughter when some guy introduced him as Dutch and asked me where from we are. I told him Serbia, and he replied that he was …"
9,Caf√© de Hartjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It is a fantastic place. Friendly staff, and they  help provide a very welcoming atmosphere. We have been coming back here for years."
10,Caf√© de Hartjes, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Do not come here. The owner and staff purposely lie about their prices (they’re not even listed on the menu) and when you go to pay they raise the tab and then threaten you unless you pay. Many other places to go but don’t go to this dump, trust me!"
11,Caf√© de Hartjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Simple and small but the location is the winner. Movielike atmosphere outside! Heineken and Amstel on the menu, more than enough."
12,Caf√© de Hartjes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Small bar close to the red light, great if you want to be in the crowd but not too deep. Good beer but food is a stretch"
13,Caf√© de Hartjes, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It was a nice little spot to grab a beer and avoid the big crowds. Prices were fair and the lady working there was friendly.
14,Caf√© de Hartjes, 4 stars ,4 years ago,It is close to a big Street market. They have a small terrace and they have a menu with some hamburgers. It is a good place to have a coffee/beer after visit the market.
15,Caf√© de Hartjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Typical Dutch pub, lady behind the bar is nice. Always have a beer when in town."
16,Caf√© de Hartjes, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Beer was quite expensive. Service was good. Nearby team got burgers which they haven't ordered (sauce was wrong)
