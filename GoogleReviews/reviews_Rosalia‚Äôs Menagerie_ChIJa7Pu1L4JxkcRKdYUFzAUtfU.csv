24,Rosalia‚Äôs Menagerie, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great Cocktails, great staff, amazing location and music. It is a sit-down bar, which produces a very intimate atmosphere.

38,Rosalia‚Äôs Menagerie, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A warm and relaxing atmosphere with a different take on experiencing cocktails and Jenevers. The friendly staff showed us their skills and also recommended us other places to learn more about Jenever. This bar is definitely worth a look and - if you feel adventurous - a romantic end to a date.
39,Rosalia‚Äôs Menagerie, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"An extremely grumpy owner, a very nice bartender, two ok drinks, some ok food, some very nice decorations make for an ok but somewhat expensive bar experience. In a town featuring Tales and Spirits and Hiding In Plain Sight: just ok."
40,Rosalia‚Äôs Menagerie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Do yourself a favor and spend an evening in this cozy, quirky, romantic cocktail bar. On their menu, you choose your drink based on the tasting notes instead of the ingredients, but don't worry, you can ask for guidance if you want to avoid …"
