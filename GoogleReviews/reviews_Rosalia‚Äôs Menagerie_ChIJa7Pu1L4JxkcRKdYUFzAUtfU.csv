8,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Small but oh so sweet. This place can fit a very limited amount of people which guarantees you A-class service but also interaction with fellow guests. Insane collection of Genevers and craft cocktail menu. Offers small but high quality bar snacks.
9,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"The ambient is cozy, really nice to come as a couple. 3 stars for the service. The menu is rather limited without much information, but does offer a ""custom"" option. We asked for a simple drink for which the spirit was not available. ‚Ä¶"
10,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,9 months ago,It's the perfect place! Come here if you wanna get super quality drinks in a very chilled place. The staff is great and they make you feel at home. Would definitely recommend it!

12,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Have been here twice now, on both occasions I have had fantastic service with an effort from the staff to learn your personal preferences but also make you as comfortable as possible.

22,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place with great cocktails. Like the other reviewers state, their cocktails are by flavor profile and as such you order based on descriptions. The bartenders know what they‚Äôre doing!! Believe the reviews and go there. So worth it!!"
23,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is far and away the best experience I have ever had in the Netherlands. I wish I had known about the Menagerie on previous visits. There is nothing the staff don't know about cocktails and spirits, and they make every drink with love ‚Ä¶"
24,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great Cocktails, great staff, amazing location and music. It is a sit-down bar, which produces a very intimate atmosphere. Cocktails are described by flavor labels, which I personally prefer. We had a great evening! There should be more bars like this."
25,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We really enjoyed our stay in this bar. Cozy interior and very friendly + attentive staff.
The cocktails are described by taste but you can also ask what's inside. ‚Ä¶"
26,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was skeptical when I saw their 4.9 rating on Google and I was scared of how high the bill would be when they sat us down, took my coat, gave us complementary drinks, and explained their menu. But no! Cocktails are extremely reasonably ‚Ä¶"
27,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Expertise is clear. Both in putting together masterful flavour blends and in servicing thirsty passengers. ‚Ä¶
28,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Waiter and barkeeper were super friendly and knowledgeable. Hence, the drinks were equally enjoyable. When we did not like one drink, they asked what we would like different and brought us a new one. The view is worth the visit as well!"
29,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have never been in such a quirky and atmospheric set up!!! It was a beautiful bar featuring a sailors cabin, the dark lighting and wide array of alternating drinks makes it a huge recommendation!! Will come again!"
30,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great experience here. Both bartender and server were chatty, gave recommendations, were attentive and all round nice.

36,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredible cocktail bar full of character. Amazing menu carefully thought out drinks each according to a theme.

37,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really nice cocktails in a cosy / boudoir like ambiance.
38,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A warm and relaxing atmosphere with a different take on experiencing cocktails and Jenevers. The friendly staff showed us their skills and also recommended us other places to learn more about Jenever. This bar is definitely worth a look and - if you feel adventurous - a romantic end to a date.
39,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"An extremely grumpy owner, a very nice bartender, two ok drinks, some ok food, some very nice decorations make for an ok but somewhat expensive bar experience. In a town featuring Tales and Spirits and Hiding In Plain Sight: just ok."
40,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Do yourself a favor and spend an evening in this cozy, quirky, romantic cocktail bar. On their menu, you choose your drink based on the tasting notes instead of the ingredients, but don't worry, you can ask for guidance if you want to avoid ‚Ä¶"
41,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A true hidden gem in the center of amsterdam! Amazing cocktails, amazing staff, amazing atmosphere. Perfect for a date or relaxing with one or two friends. I wouldn't recommend taking a group though, since it's a small bar and it will ruin the cozy atmosphere."
42,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Highlight of my holiday with my partner. Best cocktail we‚Äôve ever had called ‚ÄúThe Mission‚Äù. Great atmosphere, lovely staff and delicious cocktails."

45,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great cocktails, awesome staff and excellent tunes. This place is a cool little bar filled with curiosities. Thank you Wouter and Emily for the good vibes and awesome drinks. The Great White, Quadruple Porter, Port Cobbler, Duck or Rabbit and Wine Trader Punch were all beautifully executed!

75,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best cocktail bars in Amsterdam and a bit of a hidden secret. Sophisticated, intimate bar with phenomenal cocktails with a very unique twist. Love the idea of serving based on flavour profile rather than ingredients - keeps the mystery.

89,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent cocktails very quiet bar you need to ring the bell to get in. A bit pretentious and if you aren't dressed the part you are made to feel like you don't belong here. A nice experience for one but wouldn't stay for long.

104,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A very cosy place with a different way of serving cocktails. You choose your cocktails without actually knowing what alcohol is in the drink. (You can ask for it if you want). The music is super good too
105,Rosalia‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Menagerie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Definitely worth going to. Great staff and the decor is so interesting. The cocktails are very good and not very expensive. The staff are also very helpful at helping you decide on what to choose.
