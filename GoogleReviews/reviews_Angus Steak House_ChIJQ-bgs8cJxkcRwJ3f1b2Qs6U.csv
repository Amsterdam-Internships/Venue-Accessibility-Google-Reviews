37,Angus Steak House, 2 stars ,a year ago,Went there for dinner. The meat and fries were good. The wine was terrible. As we did select the cheapest option on the menu we all felt the waitress was not so friendly and trying to sell more things (e.g. sauce ) which did not make the moment enjoyable... a pity.

44,Angus Steak House, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had an Angus burger here with a coke. Staff were really friendly and helpful, chips were absolutely delicious but burger was absolutely smothered with sauce which hadn't been mentioned in the menu and this kind of ruined it.

46,Angus Steak House, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was good, good menu, BUT really disadvantaged by the non-stop hard core gangster music. Now I'm cool with this at a house party or club but not lunch at a steak house! I had a beer and left didn't order food."
47,Angus Steak House, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We ordered burgers and fries and everything was nice except the meat. Low quality meat and very greasy. Also all the burgers share the same meat and differ only on the toppings, it’s a shame to visit a steakhouse with such a disappointing …"
