Good quality food, attention and more important in this city correct prices …"
6,B&B, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Sandwiches are really good. But they have very weird pricing. Way overpriced for what you get. Their steak sandwitches are the best in taste and price! But then all of their (smaller) normal sandwitches are 8 and above. Too unfortunate, because you definitely need 2 for a decent lunch."

I recommend it big time."
