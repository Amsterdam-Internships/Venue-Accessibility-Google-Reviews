0,Caf√©, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I came across these old photos (wish I took more), but I remember this being a nice place to stop and have some interesting beers during my stay in Anchorage (Dutch, Belgian, and American craft beers, etc.). I do not think I tried any of the food (maybe because of the price). Lastly, the decor was very nice; unique; and inviting."
1,Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Went here for brunch today, and it was so refreshing to see a business that cares about the health and safety of their patrons and staff.
I got the eggs Benedict and it was divine. All the dishes were ordered were very …"
2,Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 months ago,"Food is awesome! My family and I frequent this establishment, but it feels very hostile and not enjoyable or relaxing due to the high strung mask requirement. I honestly feel bad for the nice staff that have to work with such an aggressive …"
3,Caf√©, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"This place is amazing. We ordered the special today- carved ham, cottage potatoes, eggs and a homemade biscuit. WOW. It was all soo good. Coffee was excellent and service was superb. What a find, wish we had one back in Florida!"
4,Caf√©, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"Petty, pathetic authoritarians! Don’t eat here unless you want to be harassed and bossed around by people who have zero sense. You can’t drink coffee through a mask, but they poured me coffee and then ordered me to put my mask on anyway, …"
5,Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Food was good. Good price for kid plates. Server was vary confrontational about their mask policy even though we were wearing ours. Did not give a greeting welcoming vide.
6,Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"So, food is pretty good, prices are high (but what prices aren’t high in Alaska), and customer service is subpar. The issue here is, the restaurant is acting as though we (the customer) needs them. When you walk in, you are immediately …"
7,Caf√©, 1 star ,2 months ago,"These folks are mask Nazis.  The person who greeted us at the door was very rude.  There are plenty of other restaurants in the Anchorage area that value their customers.  Additionally, the food, while good, wasn’t worth the price."
8,Caf√©, 1 star ,4 months ago,We used to love this place especially their eggs Benedict. However our Visit today sadly will be our last. Upon approaching the building there’s a large sign outside explaining the mask mandate. I was grabbing a mask as I opened the door …
9,Caf√©, 1 star ,6 months ago,"This place is a joke !! They don’t let you in the door without a mask ,you have to sit at your table with a mask on you must eat with your mask on . Let’s review there is NO city mandate or state mandate . The hostess was EXTREMELY RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL! I wouldn’t eat there EVER … DO NOT WASTE your time on this awful place ."
10,Caf√©, 1 star ,3 months ago,I had a similar “face mask” experience.  The owner is over the top with her zealousness regarding masks.  My husband and I decided to stop for a late lunch.  Upon entering the cafe the owner rushed at me telling me I needed a mask before …
11,Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Had the awesome Molaska Benedict.  The salmon lox is made in their kitchen.  Please note masks are strongly enforce to protect employees.  This is not an issue for me.
12,Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I love this place just as much today as I did when I first discovered it in 2004. I get the impression that all of the people leaving negative reviews are more than likely self-entitled rude customers who have never experienced a restaurant …
13,Caf√©, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Will never, ever come back! We almost left immediately before even sitting down to our table. It was awkward and very unwelcoming!  Like many other reviews on here, instantly as you walk in. You’re being hounded about mask. In which, I had …"
14,Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I'm not particularly concerned about COVID; nevertheless, the restaurant goes out of its way to establish its rules of engagement on the outside of the store. If you're going into the restaurant without a mask, and getting surprised by them …"
15,Caf√©, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Cute little place, pretty good food. Glad they take the pandemic serious, I’d come back next time i’m in Anchorage for breakfast"
16,Caf√©, 1 star ,4 months ago,"My friend was putting on one of the mask they kindly have available, I had mine on. She opened the door to come talk to us and I held the door open for her. She quickly explained on the establishments mask policy of which we were going to …"
17,Caf√©, 1 star ,4 months ago,This was by far the worst customer service I have ever seen anywhere. An older woman with short hair stormed towards me and my daughter practically shoving us out the door and then treated my husband the same way when he came in with our …
18,Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Breakfast was wonderful! Great selection of beer. We'll definitely be back. The staff was super friendly but strict about their mask policy so if strapping a piece of cloth to your face for two minutes is a deal breaker for you go somewhere else. More deliciousness for the rest of us!
19,Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This is one of the most authentic European experiences I've had stateside. The owners care about the experience, carry interesting beers and serve them properly, and they also care about guest safety so enforce mask mandates to keep everyone safe. Can't wait to return"
20,Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"So, food is pretty good, prices are high (but what prices aren’t high in Alaska), and customer service is subpar. The issue here is, the restaurant is acting as though we (the customer) needs them. When you walk in, you are immediately …"
21,Caf√©, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"This restaurant reminds me of small town pubs in Germany and Netherlands. The staff seem to know everyone who walks through the door. Good stuff, I had breakfast but it seems like it would be a great place to go in the evening."
22,Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 months ago,Quaint cafe. Service was great. Food was average. Over priced..
23,Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This is one of the most authentic European experiences I've had stateside.

24,Caf√©, 1 star ,2 months ago,Worst service of my life. Literally so rude and disrespectful the whole time I was there. And the food tasted frozen
25,Caf√©, 1 star ,4 months ago,This was by far the worst customer service I have ever seen anywhere. An older woman with short hair stormed towards me and my daughter practically shoving us out the door and then treated my husband the same way when he came in with our …

27,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Who's the KC Live to come here he was a good man
28,Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Safe and delicious!! Wish I could have breakfast there everyday!! Don’t leave without trying the cottage potatoes and berry jam made in-house! I appreciated the servers and patrons wearing masks, serves could be seen washing hands and the food was great. The servers were attentive and this menu reminded me of The Netherlands."
29,Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great service and the food was delicious! We felt very safe with the Covid precautions the restaurant took. The employees were very friendly and welcoming to us.
30,Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Always a delicious brunch! Today I went with the mushroom-swiss omlette with fruit and an English muffin. Another favorite is the Croque Madame!
31,Caf√©, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Was going to sit and read a book, but masks fog up my glasses. Was told I couldn't be seated if I wouldn't constantly wear a mask. Not sure how I was supposed to eat, but I guess that doesn't matter at a restaurant"
32,Caf√©, 2 stars ,5 months ago,The food was ok. The service left something to be desired. The overbearing mask requirement did not add to the overall experience. Good beer tho.
33,Caf√©, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Rude service, I have never felt compelled to walk out of a restaurant, but I had no choice here. I just moved to the neighborhood and I was really excited to try the local cafe. I was overwhelmed with disappointment by the unwelcoming hospitality of the establishment."
34,Caf√©, 1 star ,9 months ago,There is definitely something wrong with the guard lady at the front door. Her aggressive and very unnecessary attitude was shocking. I just entered the building without a mask after the mandate to ask a question about the menu. She made it …
35,Caf√©, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Good food! Their blueberry vinaigrette is awesome.

I’ve been going to multiple places in town to just see where everyone is doing …"
36,Caf√©, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Very rude,  customer service needs a overhaul at this place. I will never return to this restaurant. If you are interrupted by customers, maybe find a new line of work. We are the lifeblood of your business."
37,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great food, wonderful location. Lovely service"
38,Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"excellent food, excellent service, highly recommended to those looking for a morning meal to start off the day."
39,Caf√©, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"This place has some of the best food ever! The owners however are crazy. They are rude to guest, and abusive to their staff."
40,Caf√©, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I have never been treated more poorly by staff at a restaurant, ever in my life, than I was here. Absolutely do not go."
41,Caf√©, 1 star ,9 months ago,"TERRIBLE SERVICE. My family and I were trying to walk in for breakfast and the owner told us to go ""home and get properly dressed"" meaning wear a mask. Even though we had masks. The owner is incredibly rude. …"
42,Caf√©, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Food is alright but was greeted very aggressively about masks and got a lecture rather than a simple please put on your masks.  It was so aggressive and paranoid, it makes me wonder what they are scared of.  Never been treated like that …"
43,Caf√©, 1 star ,2 months ago,Worst service of my life. Literally so rude and disrespectful the whole time I was there. And the food tasted frozen
44,Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Hands down one of the best kept secrets in Anchorage! If you want a well made breakfast, that also breaks the mold and shakes things up. This is the place for you!"
45,Caf√©, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Wow…. The establishment should lighten up a bit. Very strict and not friendly!!! I’m on vacation and want to enjoy the area! It sounded like a fun place, but decided to go to Village Inn. So friendly and good!!"
46,Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Too pricey for the meal you get, staff is professional but not in the best of moods in the mornings! We were there for breakfast."
47,Caf√©, 1 star ,8 months ago,Absolutely rude to the core. Forcing masks and refused service for my service dog which is 4 lbs. Will never ever be back. What a shame …
48,Caf√©, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Food was good but was rude about mask wearing while we were still sitting and enjoying our tea and 12 feet away from the nearest person.  If you want freedom from mask wearing this is not the place to go.
49,Caf√©, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"I’m happy to comply with the emergency orders, but for the owner to tell my partner and I to leave without even being allowed to make a decision to stay and comply is  unprofessional and tasteless. I haven’t been out to any restaurants with …"
50,Caf√©, 5 stars ,5 months ago,I love this place.  Good service and good food.  They really care about their business and the community..
51,Caf√©, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Walked up here with a couple friends, before we even could open the door, the waitress comes out and berates us on we need to wear a masks (this is after the mask mandate was lifted).  Before we could even put our masks on she told us to …"
52,Caf√©, 1 star ,10 months ago,"The owner is rude and ignorant ,welcomed us at the doors by stating ""you are not going to feel comphortable in our place"".🤔🤔🤔.
I wondered why but she didn't state a thing. …"

55,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We moved out of state 7 years ago and are back for a visit.  We were delighted to find Cafe Amsterdam was just as it was, great food and great people.  Croissant Beatrix is and was my favorite!"

58,Caf√©, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My husband, friends, and I, have enjoyed this amazing Cafe for years and can only praise the best food and service.  Because I'm fussy,  this is the only place I'll have breakfast.  This family goes above and beyond to make dining a celebration of time together, enjoying delicious meals.  Fabulous."
59,Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Went for breakfast. Had some very good black coffee and the water tasted good as well. Ate the smoked salmon eggs benedict. Very savory and fresh tasting. Service was great with being a family owned place. Water and coffee were never empty. …
60,Caf√©, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great breakfast Sunday morning. The crepe Benedict with spinach and  ham special was delicious. The owner and staff are always welcoming.
61,Caf√©, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Say what will, but the truth is the food is authentic. My husband and I shared a breakfast and supper together and could only think of Europe. True European taste with authentic techniques. Will always go back no matter the wait. Keep bringing the feel of authentic European cuisine to anchorage."
62,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Excellent service delicious food!!! Fyi mask mandate is definitely a plus!!
63,Caf√©, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I’ve been eating at Cafe Amsterdam for 17+ years. The food is excellent (Kens omelettes are far superior to any others, including those I had in France), and everything on the menu is good or great. I’d go twice a week if it were open. Prices are fair and the service is very good. I take guests at every opportunity."
64,Caf√©, 2 stars ,10 months ago,I wasn't too happy with the initial meet and great. The older waitress was a bit bossy and demanding wanting me to stand at the end of the bar. We haven't been there before and now probably won't go back
65,Caf√©, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great fresh food, good service. Lots of beer choices. Centrally located. Love the place! It is where the locals go."
66,Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome breakfast at a reasonable price in a low key atmosphere.
67,Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have forgotten how good the food is here, I am so glad to het the consistency in food quality and service.  I am not a fan of homefries, but theirs are so good.  Our server didn't hover and come to our table every minute like some places. …"
68,Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Simple but tasty sandwiches and wide selection of beers. Friendly staff.
69,Caf√©, 1 star ,a year ago,"I would give this a zero star! I haven't even tried their food yet!! I walked in to get a table to eat with my husband and instead of asking us nicely to put on a mask, she deliberately walked us OUTSIDE and told us to come back another time!!! I will NEVER come back here again!!"
70,Caf√©, 1 star ,a year ago,"Walked in and immediately owner took me outside to question me about Covid. Not coughing or anything, basically singled out for actually wearing a mask. Asked me if I've been out if the state in the last two weeks. I said, that's arbitrary …"
71,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Who's the KC Live to come here he was a good man
72,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful service from Shauna P. The Spanish omelette was super tasty with lots of veggies, and the side of potatoes were cooked just right. I'm excited to return for lunch and try out the yummy looking sandwich menu as well as a beverage …"
73,Caf√©, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff at less than friendly prices.  Definitely a place intended for alcohol connoisseurs with food as just background scenery.  The food itself was slightly above average.  I dined alone so maybe it's a better experience with company, but I'm not planning on coming back here unless I'm invited."
74,Caf√©, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The beer utterly fantastic with a number of unique brews you can't get anywhere else in Anchorage. Try the house beer for something really unique. Unfortunately they only serve beer five hours a day. The food was tasty, with good portions …"
75,Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Took my wife there for her birthday. She got the Ruben sandwich, I got killer eggs Benedict with avocado(perfectly ripe) and we split the French toast. Every single bite was brilliant. Cafe Amsterdam has ruined us, now we can’t eat anywhere else. Best breakfast in Anchorage; I dare to say in AK:)"
76,Caf√©, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Food was great and the store was nice but the server lady was rude to my mom !
77,Caf√©, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Still a reliable place to have Sunday breakfast or brunch. Start with an expresso drink or drop coffee. Then choose from a good variety of Benedicts, omelets, eggs/breakfast meats or great sandwiches combos on bread, croissants, or bagels. …"
78,Caf√©, 1 star ,8 months ago,"The woman restaurant manager was unfriendly and controlling.  The food was just ok, could easily have been better."
79,Caf√©, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Stuck in the height of Pandemic rules. Today, had to mask up, keep mask on when not actively eating and didnt care about vaccinated. Suggest avoiding until they fix this."
80,Caf√©, 5 stars ,a year ago,Had the Barvarian Apple cake and a bowl of the tomato soup. Hands down best breakfast I've had in a very long time! Customer service was also above and beyond!
81,Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I had breakfast there the other week. Great food with fresh ingredients. I also ordered a mimosa which was good. Smaller venue, not too crowded. A little pricey but you get quality. I will be visiting this place again. It is in the same plaza as La Bodega and Great Harvest. Parking should not be an issue."
82,Caf√©, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Great staff, great food, definitely worth a stop if your In anchorage. Been going here for years, and it’s never disappointed me."
83,Caf√©, 1 star ,2 years ago,I was walking and needed to use the restroom and seen Cafe Amsterdam had no  sign saying no public restroom. So I went in and I walked out and there was a chair in the door entry where I could not leave. A waitress approach me and ask if I …

86,Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great food and helpful and courteous staff
87,Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great Eggs Benedict and their homemade jam/jelly was delicious! Also tried the lox which was also very good but would've been better if it came with a bagel or bread. Reasonably priced and I'd definitely recommend for anyone travelling through Anchorage.
88,Caf√©, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"This café is nothing impressive at all. You walk in there and the lady greeting you is quite dry.
The menu sounds better than it really is. Breakfast is always  very small …"
89,Caf√©, 5 stars ,a year ago,Wonderful food as always and it’s nice to know they take the safety of others so seriously.  It’s why I’m comfortable eating out there.  Thank you
90,Caf√©, 1 star ,a year ago,My grandparents and I are on vacation here in Alaska. The lady that greeted us was extremely rude. After the rude encounter we left the restaurant and decided that we would not be giving our business to that restaurant.
91,Caf√©, 1 star ,9 months ago,I would have put no stars. Walked in and was accosted and pushed back out the door because I didn't have a mask. So I got a mask and went back in. The food was not very good and the service was extremely bad!
92,Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful atmosphere. Tasty food and excellent service!
93,Caf√©, 1 star ,7 years ago,Was seated on Valentine's Day morning and given menus and water in the middle of the restaurant. Then ignored for 15 minutes. Two other tables seated after us got attention. The person who seated us knew we weren't being taken care of and …
94,Caf√©, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"Service was slow, but courteous. The food was lacking and not something I would come back for. The ""cottage potatoes"" were in fact under cooked, over seasoned, fried potatoes. When I attempted to let the management know about the issues with my meal, they had an excuse for everything and did not appear interested in improving."
95,Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My family stopped by on  vacation and everyone enjoyed their meal. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The beer selection was great. We will be back the next time we are in town.
96,Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good, but not what I expected, staff was nice, but not very engaging. They seem to do just fine though, and could go without my business; I really would like to see a wider selection of the already limited beverages though."
97,Caf√©, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Used to be reasonably priced. Went there yesterday for breakfast and was blown away by the menu prices. $7 for a half avacodo, $4 for a piece of toast, $11 for oatmeal and the rest of the menu ranging from $14-$20+ and averaging at $15. I …"
98,Caf√©, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing food and great service, in my opinion they go a little bit too far with COVID precautions, but other than that no complaints!"
99,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We stopped here to say hi to an old friend and had some coffee and breakfast.
I ordered the Spanish omelet with sourdough toast .
OMG this was the best omelet and breakfast I have had in a loooonng time, VERY …"
100,Caf√©, 1 star ,9 months ago,I would have put no stars if possible. Disgusting and super unfriendly service. Maybe I just caught them at a bad time or something but definitely would not go back
101,Caf√©, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The service and food are quite good, as expected. The pricing is an issue, a $15 breakfast is high even in anchorage. The decor, lighting and seating is outdated but neat and clean. Coffee is a bit weak. I enjoyed. My food and the service."
102,Caf√©, 1 star ,9 months ago,They still have a mask requirement and it is the strictest and most complicated of any restaurant I've been to!

106,Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Bavarian Apple Cake with cinnamon butter...mmmmmmm! These are some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The customer service is always great too.
107,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First, it is pricey, especially if you order ala cart. That said, BEST EGGS BENEDICT IN ANCHORAGE. The only place we've been to that has a perfect poached eggs...so the yolk oozes out onto the hollandaise when you cut into it. The …"
108,Caf√©, 1 star ,4 months ago,Stop lying about my review and accept what you do.
109,Caf√©, 2 stars ,3 years ago,First time here  driven by several times so I thought I would stop in. Eggs were almost white in my omelette. Potatoes were over cooked. And why do restaurants serve toast with rock hard butter? Snowy goose here I come.
110,Caf√©, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was decent, but over priced. The waitress, who appeared to be the owner, was rude and unprofessional. Save your money and go to McDonald's."
111,Caf√©, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food is always fresh and ingredients are great quality. Its medium priced but again quality ingredients. The rye bread was the best I have ever had.
112,Caf√©, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My favorite breakfast spot in Anchorage. My wife likes the Croisant Beatrix and I like the Eggs Benedict. They have grest sandwiches at lunch time and a large selection of craft beers for after work.

119,Caf√©, 1 star ,6 years ago,Don't waste you'r money on this establishment.  Bad service combined with bad food. Ordered a beef sirloin soup and got beef flavored water with a chunk of potato. The water is room temperature  with no ice or straw the yogurt was sour as well

125,Caf√©, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Came in early for a beer with my uncle.  After patiently waiting for 10 mins, the lady bartender was extremely rude and bossy.  We left, and I believe another couple followed us out."
