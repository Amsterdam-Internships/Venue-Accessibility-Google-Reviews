0,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Had a brunch and some conversations here. The place is nice and cozy, but a bit small. Better come with 2 people. We were 4 and they didn‚Äôt have a big table so they had to put two small tables together to make place for us, which is really ‚Ä¶"
1,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,a month ago,"I have visited this place multiple times and I really enjoy their breakfast and brunch options. Orange juice served with breakfast is always fresh. They have lots of vegan options available.
They have both outdoor as well as indoor seating."
2,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Amazing pastry offer. Overpriced for sure. One almond croissant 4.75. Service was super slow, a couple left while we were waiting but it's only die to one unmotivated staff member."
3,Le Pain Quotidien, 1 star ,a month ago,"Espresso was terrible: burnt, acidic and 3.1 EUR. Chocolate croissant was not a croissant but Pain au Chocolat. ""Le petit"" menu (espresso + croissant + orange juice) for more than 10 EUR. Everything low quality and overpriced."
4,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,a month ago,The scrambled eggs and omelettes are delicious and the portions are big enough to keep you full all day.
5,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,2 years ago,There are a handful of Le Pain Quotidien (LPQ) cafes around Amsterdam including this branch along Beethovenstraat. Opening hours 8am to 6pm daily. ‚Ä¶
6,Le Pain Quotidien, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Waited 20 minutes to be served. Another 20 minutes for 2 coffees, a croissant and a muffin. There was no lack of staff. They just had no clue as to what to do."
7,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing place for brunch! Large portions, low prices, delicious combinations. Just the hot apple juice with cinnamon & ginger is worth a reward; toast is served with a white chocolate spread, among other deliciousness.. the day before we ‚Ä¶"
8,Le Pain Quotidien, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"The food is nice, the omelette is amazing...the service is really bad, the guys are too young (I don't think they get any training in customer service). So if you have patience and time, good place to eat."
9,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious quiche and salad! The portion was huge. I only ate half and took the other half for dinner.
10,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty good, pretty tasty, nice background music. Pretty good staff (try to help people in the order they are going to sit). Nice that you can use choco pasta (or jam) for free."
11,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very good and tasty food, fresh and good quality ingredients together with great service. Also, probably the best hot chocolate in town."
12,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing! See for yourself, all organic dishes, plentiful at a reasonable price. Service is great, best way to start a Sunday."
13,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful breakfast, great coffee and friendly service. Highly recommend"
14,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Was fairly crowded when I went on a Saturday morning. All organic breakfast. Quite pricey but decent food.
15,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Well priced, consistent quality, delicious - preferred this to many other places we tried in Amsterdam"
16,Le Pain Quotidien, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Okay food,  nothing spectacular. Out of the three choices we made two weren't available. Friendly service. Okay location"
17,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The staff are courteous but they share responsibility for tables. This can lead to confusion. I ordered eggs with only baguette. The next waiter brought eggs with rye bread. I explained the order. He took the bread back and never came back. When I asked, he thought I didn't want any bread. 20 minutes lost."
18,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We ate breakfast here because it seemed like one of the few places open in the area. Food was decent and staff was friendly and helpful! Everything was decently priced for the portion sized. Overall, we had a good experience here, and would recommend it to people in the area!"
19,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Love it! Lots of options, really decent portions for quite low prices compared to other brunch places. Everything is tasty and I love the bread (as a French I don't say that often here). ‚Ä¶"
20,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious range of whole foods and cakes. Great coffee served at large communal tables or  smaller two to four person tables. Service was a little slow and one of our meals was incorrect. The mistake was rectified quickly and without issue.
21,Le Pain Quotidien, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Maybe the worst lunch/service I ever had in Amsterdam in 2 years. The salad was without any dressing, literally taken from the bag and put on the plate. A thin slice of bread with half a loaf of bread on top (?), a scoop of goat cheese with ‚Ä¶"
22,Le Pain Quotidien, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Super bad service. I had to (1) get my menu myself after waiting for at least 7 min and (2) I asked to remove one chair to be less squeezed between the tables. The waiter refused despite me being uncomfortable and squeezed. It is not the ‚Ä¶
23,Le Pain Quotidien, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Excellent food and service! Highly recommended
24,Le Pain Quotidien, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Awful LPQ experience.. food was disgrace. As a big fan of LPQ in London my Amsterdam experience on Beethovenstraat was shameful. The food was just abhorable. The sitting crammed. But overall the food: my tartine was soggy, burnt on edges ‚Ä¶"
25,Le Pain Quotidien, 1 star ,4 years ago,We walked in and asked if they could serve 7 adults and 5 kids. There was a large table available. We were met with a frown and a big sigh as if to say it was really a pain to have customers!! Better watch out your customer welcome if you want to maintain your high rating.
26,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We ate breakfast and it was delicious.  I had goat cheese omelette and I added avocado.  The coffee and croissants were excellent

30,Le Pain Quotidien, 2 stars ,a year ago,Was for the first time hier. It was not busy it all but everybody were busy with everything except the visitors.  Got my coffee only after 15 minutes that's all I have ordered. And the most disappointing the coffee was already cold.

38,Le Pain Quotidien, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Always a globally consistent franchise with decent food and coffee. Reasonably priced place with some small tables outside in good weather.
39,Le Pain Quotidien, 3 stars ,3 years ago,it's a place where I could go more often as the food is very good and the meals are healthy but the staff could be more friendly with especially foreign customers!
40,Le Pain Quotidien, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Organic pot-au-feu with quinua is very nice!  It's little bit noisy because of some customers today.
