0,Radijs, 5 stars ,a year ago,The staff were really friendly and efficient. Their terrace is really cosy as you have the canal view. I had a veggie burger which was really delicious.
1,Radijs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is awesome, delicious food, friendly staff, cozy atmosphere and very good prices. ‚Ä¶"
2,Radijs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great neighborhood caf√©/pub! Yummy food and coffee, friendly and accomodating service. They aren't very strict with opening hours so double-check with them in person rather than relying on the hours posted online."
3,Radijs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best enjoyed in the summer! Go down the stairs and chill out with a Weizen beer at the water side terrace. They got classic cafe food, serving burgers, steaks and some vega options. Only downside, inside it might smell a bit like the extractor from the open kitchen."
4,Radijs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The snacks are very tasty, and there is a decent variety of beers from the tap (ie: oedipus or Browerij't ij). The cheesecake and the chocolate volcano were from other world! The location is great, as it is next to a really lovely channel, typical postcard of Amsterdam. The prices are average, this is Amsterdam and won't be cheap..."
5,Radijs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome food, great staff and absolutely fair prices. 5/5, worth a visit. Quite full in the evening so bring some time (15-30 minutes) to wait at their bar or make a reservation"
6,Radijs, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We order a cheese Board priced at ‚Ç¨9.50 and received a two old, broken cheese with some brown sauce. One of them was blue cheese.
Disappointing. ‚Ä¶"
7,Radijs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place next to the beautiful Admiralengracht canal, nice coffee and food with a good selection of beers, a bit expensive in my opinion but almost everywhere in Amsterdam is expensive."
8,Radijs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great breakfast place. Had the eggs beney, with freshly squeezed oj. Busy little intersection great place to sit and relax with a coffee. Service was friendly and pleasant."
9,Radijs, 3 stars ,a year ago,Some staff are friendly some need to be educated. I mean when you cannot tell what wines you have or what food to recommend you need to go back to learn the basics. The waitress who served us did not pay much attention. We got our food before any cutlery was put on the table.
10,Radijs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, fairly priced, right by the canal. I had a chicken-bacon-avocado sandwich and the tomato soup."
11,Radijs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely locals joint (all are welcome, even me) . The food is a modern European take on great grub. The staff are attentive and fun, what more do you want. Oh, great beer üç∫ and I assume they have the finest tap water in Holland. Tip: Describe the atmosphere"
12,Radijs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the beter terraces in west Amsterdam. Portions are nice and big!
13,Radijs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A big 'thank you' to the friendly staff for accommodating a family of six between reservations! The food was well prepared and flavourful. Unfortunately the French fries / chips ordered by three of us were overcooked (too hard). But I would be happy to return on my next visit to Amsterdam!
14,Radijs, 4 stars ,a year ago,It is a really nice place. But after spend almost 300‚Ç¨ in 2 weeks(2 person) I expected free shots in the last visit. They recognized us although they were reluctant to invite us to 2 shots üò©
15,Radijs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This place was recommended to me by a local and it did not disappoint. I came here on a Sunday for their brunch menu.  The restaurant has an open kitchen view and a nice little bar area.  Plenty of sitting inside or you can sit outside if ‚Ä¶
16,Radijs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was really good and I was very happy with it. The part I didn't like about this place was the long wait for the staff to even come to our table to ask if what we wanted. Took ages to just get the bill when we were done. Other than this, it was a nice place."
17,Radijs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A warm and friendly atmosphere, due to the not too spacious, living room like interior and the ever-friendly staff. ‚Ä¶"
18,Radijs, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Passing by this place I went in to vht their menu and was greeted by a friendly, polite server. He explained the menu options, specials, and offered a place for our luggage.    No hard sell. We sat down and ordered food which arrived ‚Ä¶"
19,Radijs, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"It's a great place to go after work. Burgers are juicy and tasty. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their beers, although the selection is small. ‚Ä¶"
20,Radijs, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The quality of food changed depended on which cooks were working. However, there were days where we've had amazing food! Service in general was universally slow/poor though, but allows you to enjoy the sun/canals more. Probably not a place to go to if you're in a rush."
21,Radijs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My new favourite local! Super friendly and chill üòäüëåü¶Ñ
22,Radijs, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A fun and friendly local bar and restaurant.
This place serves fresh, simple soul food and it does so with aplomb. There's a small but interesting selection of beer and wine, an open kitchen and upbeat bar ‚Ä¶"

24,Radijs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favorite bars in Amsterdam. You can sit by the canals and enjoy your beer.
Good burgers and really friendly staffs."
25,Radijs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great caf√©, and a perfect spot in summer as they have the waterfront, just down the steps. Could fast become a Sunday tradition if you love in the West. Service is usually pretty good too, a rarity in Amsterdam."
26,Radijs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, good snacks and drinks. Lovely atmosphere. Staff are a bit hit and miss but generally very good. Some days it feels like you are being rushed out, other times they are very warm and funny."
27,Radijs, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"A decent place for drinks and food, they have a good variety. They should invest however in a proper ventilation system, when they cook fish, all the smell sits inside the place..."
28,Radijs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Our neighborhood-bar-restaurant-cafe...

Luckily Radijs is only 100 meters away from our home. This spot is located next ‚Ä¶"
29,Radijs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best sun drenched terraces in the West. Get your tan in while indulging yourself on a simple but very tasty menu full of wholesome food. Fairly priced.

33,Radijs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Its a quaint little cafe with a cozy ambience that invites you in for some really good breakfast and coffee.  Loved the sandwiches  i tried there. The goat cheese pumpkin sandwich as well as the chicken avacado sandwich.
34,Radijs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Fast and friendly service. Great terrace along the canal, really good burgers. Highly recommend!"
35,Radijs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to chill with a beer or having a casual dinner. Especially when the terrace is open in the summer. One of the few places who has the longest sun on the terrace.

38,Radijs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful diner with most amazing waiter serving the best sweet potato and goats cheese ever. Lovely ambient corner of Amsterdam worth a visit.
