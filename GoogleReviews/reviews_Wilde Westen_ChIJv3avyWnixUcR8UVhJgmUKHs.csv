0,Wilde Westen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very relaxed place!  Had the bitterballen and pizza.  Both tasted great! Friendly service. Pizza did take awhile to come although the place was busy during dinner time.  I would definitely come back!
1,Wilde Westen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I come here for dinner every so often when I’m in the neighborhood and the place is nice, cozy and very hipster. They have a nice selection of drinks, not your usual ice teas and colas + the food is simple, but very decent. It has a great vibe as well!"
2,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Lunch is very good value for your money. We came for the Sunday brunch, but apparently that's cancelled during summer. Had the best tasting Dirty Chai ever and the veggie sandwich was perfection. Love ambiance of the place. …"
3,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fancy bar located below an apartment block currently next to a construction work. Hard to find without Google Maps, a real secret tip. …"
4,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This was a cool place in a lower level of an apartment building. Kind of had that college cafeteria vibe but with a bar in the middle. Service was great and accommodating. I  had the mushroom pizza and it was big enough where I had to take some back to my hotel. Would come back again but would recommend making a reservation.
5,Wilde Westen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I'm in a quest to find good pizza places in Amsterdam. The pizza I ate was very good but I missed more options. There's only a few options to choose from and if you are restrictive about choices it can be hard. If there were more options …
6,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It was a very good time with friends here. Our drinks didn't quite come on time but the waitresses were all friendly and the pizzas were delivered by someone who looked like the chef. I don't think he was the chef but that nevertheless left …
7,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great vegan pizzas, the pizza dough is really tasty! Therefore also the focaccia as a pre-snack is yummy, as the dough to die for. Friendly service and cozy atmosphere. In summer they also have a nice terrace outside with a ‘beach’ section. Reasonable prices too!"
8,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice and hip restaurant. The pizzas are very taste, but don't miss out on their chicken. It is surprisingly well prepared and the potatoes that come with it are awesome. Every Sunday morning you can enjoy a nice breakfast with some …"
9,Wilde Westen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice relaxed atmosphere in a pretty hidden location - it's a basement of a huge condo building that is well obscured by a vast inner yard, and there's not much signs to follow. Food was alright - nothing special, but good quality. Good selection of drinks, but generally it's an atmosphere itself."
10,Wilde Westen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice bread! Pizzas were pretty nice too and friendly staff. Also for kids there is a ‘movie theater’, a room with a film playing on a big screen and some chips/crisps"
11,Wilde Westen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice ambiance, spacious and great place to go with or without kids. We used to go here on Sundays for their bottomless brunch or bottomless boozy brunch. For the kids there is an extra play area underneath the stairs. …"
12,Wilde Westen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We found the Wilde Westen by chance, it's a real hidden gem, tucked under an appartment block. …"
13,Wilde Westen, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I've been here twice for coffee, and can't comment on the quality of food (which I've heard is very good.) Sadly the coffee wasn't great, dark Italian style and not third wave. The second time the music was so bad I had to leave! On the up side, it's a great space, open and well furnished and in an interesting residential location."
14,Wilde Westen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cute place, nice interior, great drinks and the boozy brunch option (€35 for unlimited cocktails on Sunday 11 am - 4 pm) is a delight. Staff always seems a bit overworked and inexperienced but they are nicer than in many other places around Amsterdam."
15,Wilde Westen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I love this place. Food is affordable and good. Not the best, but definitely good. Great friendly service! And a fantastic place for (small) children. They have an elevator too. No baby changing room though. Their Bolo breakfast is delicious and what a deal! Croissant, OJ, coffee and yoghurt with granola for only €5 🤘"
16,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, can highly recommend the pizza (all) chicken and burrata with green asparagus. They do a mean old fashioned cocktail as well. All praise (and good prices for Amsterdam)"
17,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Brilliant staff and relaxed, happy atmosphere. Excellent beer, bitterballen... Fantastic start of my stay in Amsterdam thanks to your cheerfulness. Thanks guys, you have been amazing!"
18,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Another hidden gem. At least hidden if you’re a tourist in Amsterdam, or if you do not live in this area. The restaurant is located in the bottom of what looks like a slightly worn down residential building. Don’t let this deter you! …"
19,Wilde Westen, 1 star ,2 years ago,Waitress didnt put our order through. Larger tables got their food before us. We were waiting 45 min for a pizza. Not once did they come and explain the delay in the kitchen. We had to chase the waitress for explanation. Pizza wasnt even worth the 45 min wait. Think the pizza making should be left to the Italians. #cowboys
20,Wilde Westen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice place to have drinks with a group of friends. Ample, nicely decorated and cosy - it might be a bit difficult to find as it is in the basement/ground floor of the building, but it's ample inside. …"
21,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a vegan pizza and tea and my friend hat a ""normal"" pizza and an coke and everything was great! I got hot water brought to the table and could chose a tea by smelling it and they all were amazing!"
22,Wilde Westen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I was several times in this restaurant and I really liked - food, space, the opportunity to come with children. And I would never write a bad review, but today I was very surprised . I do not want to get into the details of the matter, that …"
23,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice place. Took me one year to give this a try and I was happy to find this hidden gem in BoLo. …
24,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A surprisingly nice place. They have good coffee (I took several espressos), an elaborate brunch for a fixed price and a nice and spacious ambiance. I liked it! Great place to be when you're working out of office."
25,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The employees are super friendly and serve with a smile ! :) the restaurant is cool and cozy and their pizza's are delicious ! If you want some your belly to explode (in a good way) try the tiramisu ^^
26,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,one of the best pizza’s in Amsterdam to be found in the last 15 years. Been multiple times and quality remains so the friendly staff. 100% thumbs up Team Marnix
27,Wilde Westen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Not sure why they call it the Wild West; it's a ground floor of a brutalist apartment building turned into a hip cafe. The concrete structure and steel beams are still visible, and so are the amazing plants they have! Very nice vegan-friendly all-you-can-eat brunch menu"
