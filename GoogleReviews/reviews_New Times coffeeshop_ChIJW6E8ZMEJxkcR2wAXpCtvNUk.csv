2,New Times coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best spot in town. Super chill vibe and the staff is awesome. Product is out of   this world way better than their neighbors or anyone else around. We came from New York City and checked out a lot of spots this is the one. See y‚Äôall soon
3,New Times coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice shop. All their buds come in jars which is very environmental friendly. But I do like some nice fat buds when I buy 2 gs and this way you mostly get small ones. Menu is quite expensive and not all the strains are worth their price. Did score some great SSD though. Friendly staff and chilled vibes when we visited (midday midweek)
