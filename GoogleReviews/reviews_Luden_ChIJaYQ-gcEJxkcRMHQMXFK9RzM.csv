0,Luden, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Casual dining in the heart of Ansterdam. Reasonably priced and decent food, there are set menus offered that are good value."
1,Luden, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had an amazing and well priced goats cheese salad. Super cosy with friendly staff. Menus in English as well as Dutch
2,Luden, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We went as part of a large party @30 heads in mid March. Normally when work colleagues go out for dinner together in such a big group, the service and food can be pretty bad. Have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how good the service …"
3,Luden, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had a cosy atmosphere when I went there for a quick bite. I was already really under the weather and just wanted something warm so ordered the soup & it really hit the spot. …
4,Luden, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food was ok but the service was poor.  The waitress never brought our drinks the entire meal.  She didn't stop long enough when she brought our food for me to ask for our drinks.  She never came back the entire meal.  I had to flag her down …
5,Luden, 1 star ,5 years ago,Very slow service (had to go inside to order because we didn't see anyone outside). And when asking for a hot snack platter at 1715 they say you can't order until 1730. Wow. The bill was also presented without asking for it. I guess they wanted us gone. Job well done!
6,Luden, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst service ever. I ordered a hamburger with special directions because of allergies. First time they got it wrong, second time too and also  the third time and by then I had to ask for new fries too because mine were cold. After about 35 …"
7,Luden, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good atmosphere and decent food. I had a pretty good hamburger, my wife had a rather bad caesar salad; also, we had a small table overlooking the kitchen pickup area so we were watching the plating being done for more than an hour - at some …"
8,Luden, 1 star ,4 years ago,Terrible Service!!   As a group of 4 we were brought to a table where we were ignored for at least a half an hour (the restaurant was not very busy). We grabbed menus off an other table as none were brought to us.  After our order was …
9,Luden, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was amazing (caramelised salmon, chocolate mousse), and staff were friendly and attentive. Lovely atmosphere and good for coeliacs like myself, they made sure my meal was gluten free. Excellent!"
10,Luden, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Good service but low quality food. Probably the worst burger I ever had at a restaurant. Boring bread, half warm and no crispy falafal, plus non fresh veggies. The fries were not close to well fried. Ps: am not type that complains in general."
11,Luden, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Went there with a group of friends to have a drink outside, the owner made an ass of himself and was quick unfriendly, the waitress tried to save the day but it was still not a really nice experience. I'll let others' reviews judge the …"
12,Luden, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Went there for drinks. Nice selection and friendly service.
13,Luden, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Me and my wife asked for well done steaks and what we got after an incredibly long wait was a very poorly made salad and sauce, with steaks that were near raw, cold, bloody and completely unedible. It cost €40 and all we got to eat were a couple chips. Very disappointing all round stay clear of this place."
14,Luden, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Stopped here when we couldn't find our other restaurant. Wait staff was minimal (3 total for front of house. 2 waitresses and busboy/manager) Was out of the local beer on tap. I ordered the Chefs Special that night which was a boneless …
15,Luden, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"If there's a better restaurant in Amsterdam, I haven't seen it.  Small, quaint, and superb food.  The menu is always varied, the desserts are incredible, and the service is top notch.  I travel quite a bit to NL and this is my go-to place for a great meal."
16,Luden, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We were there as a bigger group and the service staff was really unfriendly and harsh and it seemed like they made the prices higher (we got a smaller menu to order from). Not really recommended, we were disappointed. The food was delicious, but quite expensive. Waiting time was ok."
17,Luden, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very spacious. Excellent starter (carpaccio) and dessert (creme brulé Bailey's). Service great, we were asked several times if happy. …"
18,Luden, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stopped here randomly for lunch. Great service, lovely food! Had vegetarian in our group & also loved the food. More than one choice on the menu!"
19,Luden, 1 star ,3 years ago,Took 15 minutes to take food and drinks order at our table and 50 minutes later still no food. they weren't even sorry when we said we had to leave with out eating as we had a coach to catch..Will certainly not be rushing back there.
20,Luden, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good atmosphere and decent food. I had a pretty good hamburger, my wife had a rather bad caesar salad; also, we had a small table overlooking the kitchen pickup area so we were watching the plating being done for more than an hour - at some …"

26,Luden, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I'm not sure what was so offensive about me asking if they could box something to go. Other places where the answer was no, simply said no. But the social commentary of ""we aren't McDonald's"" wasn't helpful or useful.  Thanks for saving me from eating here.  I'm sure I didn't need to, the empty dining room said it all."

32,Luden, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Food was horrible, waited over 20 mins, looked and tasted like something that came out of packaging! The chips were soggy as if they had stood out over night.. and the bread stale!"
33,Luden, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The cuisine was ok, but the welcoming was really bad, we had to negociate to have a table while there was some table available inside, they finally accept that we eat outside and the waiter was really rude."
34,Luden, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Poor place to share time. Service is the worse part. They are rude and really bad manners.  Menu too basic. If you are close, plase keep your road"

42,Luden, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible service, terrible food, terrible in all ways, they didnt event have glasses for all in out company, and we were the only 20 in the restaurant with more than 80 free seetings, the restaurant was almost empty."
43,Luden, 1 star ,6 years ago,I really cannot believe I waited so long for a salmon with potatoes n some peas. I'm disappointed from such a bad experience.
