0,La Vi√±a, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Came here for a work event and it was just okay.  The salmon was watery, the salad was okay and the dessert was nothing special.  The wine pairing was just okay as well."
1,La Vi√±a, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We've tried the three course pre-set menu, it was really nice, fancy and not pricey at all (30 eur). The place is known for its good wine selection, we've opted in for the wine-for-the-menu selection, it was excellent but a bit dear with 5 ‚Ä¶"
2,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You can get 3 courses of the chef's selections for ‚Ç¨27.50 or order a la carte. We had the shrimps, veal cheeks (me), turbot (him), and lemon mousse. I got a wine arrangement --3 delicious glasses for ‚Ç¨15. Lovely outdoor seating area in a bustling neighborhood (on a Saturday evening)."
3,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely fantastic meal, and very fairly priced. The atmosphere is cosy, and has a really nice outdoor area. If you have gluten or dairy allergies, you'll love being here.... they serve dinner with gluten free bread alongside every food ‚Ä¶"
4,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"On our first night in Amsterdam in October, we came across La Vi√±a, and decided to give it a try. It was one of the best decisions we made! The ribs were by far the best I have ever had, and my wife‚Äôs salmon was delicious. The desserts were ‚Ä¶"
5,La Vi√±a, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very small side dishes. Lamb was good, steak average at best, fish not fresh, but replaced. Service could be friendlier, bit gruff. Nice outside, great neighborhood."
6,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We had a wonderful meal there.  Sidewalk table. I had the chef's special: ribs and my wife had the excellent Ravioli. It was topped off with a superb Italian wine. Don't miss this lovely place.
7,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was an amazing experience! The owner was  very friendly, she had a good knowledge of wines. Great food and perfect if you have an event in the Rai (like us after work)

8,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly host, good and lovely dinner! Highly recommended, also for those wirh special dietary needs like myself. Good wines too. Sure will come back!"
9,La Vi√±a, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Great place for a wine and a bite. The waitress recommended a nice red wine (letours) that matched really nicely with the spinach artichoke dip. Very tasty. Nice atmosphere too.
10,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Small restaurant with reasonable prices and good portions. The steak and cheesecake were incredible. Had a lot of gluten free options too.
11,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Out of this world. Off the beaten (tourist) path neighborhood restaurant. Whole menu was gluten free except for the ravioli. Iberico cheeks and chocolate fondant are a MUST. Very aware of celiac and avoid all cross contamination.
12,La Vi√±a, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice and cosy place which great atmosphere. Food is really tasteful but small portions and the side dishes are even smaller.
13,La Vi√±a, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Probably 'too good' for the common man. Small menu. Expensive. Small portions. Quality was good. Service was good.
14,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Service team is really nice and attentive. The wine list is extensive as well. A must!

32,La Vi√±a, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Last eaten here and kept a good experience. Beforehand I had the Kwartel escabeche, highly recommended. I am a steak lover, so I chose the Black Angus Steak as the main course. Cooked perfectly (medium-rare for me) ‚Ä¶"
33,La Vi√±a, 1 star ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Overpriced, lamb was mediocre, steak was fine, but bit tough. Seasonal vegetables were a sort of stir fry mix of the AH and not seasonal. We received a small piece of bread pp and a 0.75 bottle of lukewarm tap water. ‚Ä¶"
