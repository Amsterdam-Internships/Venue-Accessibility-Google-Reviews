0,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Small cozy place with authentic ramen made with care!
Ramen: I had Tonkotsu ramen. The soup was very good, (mix with garlic oil spot on)! The noodle was amazing, my fav part! Handmade, fresh, and not too soft, just ‚Ä¶"
1,Betsu Bara, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"The staff was friendly and nice, but ramen was already getting cold when it was served‚Ä¶which is huge disappointment for me. I ordered tan tan men and the taste was ok but nothing special considering the high price. Anyways if the temperature of the food is not hot, it‚Äôs just impossible for me to enjoy any ramen."
2,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very tasteful ramen, more expensive than average and probably smaller portion, but defined one of the best ramen in Amsterdam :) Go for it!"
3,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,a month ago,"First time visiting this evening and both the lady that served us first and the guy that took over were very friendly and helpful. Loved the gyoza and octopus balls to start, followed by delicious steaming hot Ramen. Perfect place for a casual evening out. Thank you!"
4,Betsu Bara, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Really terrible experience. At first, the lady working there was extremely nervous while taking the order. Then we waited for more than 20 minutes for our takeaway lunch. The reason I am sharing this is because of what happened after we ‚Ä¶"
5,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent recommendation from a friend. Place has a quite straightforward menu mainly thinking of ramen lovers. Service is quite friendly. I highly recommend the tantan men ramen for people who likes spiciness.  For more experiences like this follow @quiquinnv
6,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Place is super nice and service kind and fast. They didn't have problems in preparing gyoza in the way we preferred (pan fried or deep fried). I was not super impressed by the ramen broth (I was expecting it more tasty), but overall the experience was very good. I liked a lot the selection of beers."
7,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We sat at the window, but could not see through as they were all fogged up. The service was friendly. Nice presentation of the gyoza and the taste was very good, bit crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The ramen was good. Noodles ‚Ä¶"
8,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Busy restaurant during the dinner time. Service was quick, but somehow all waiters seem have no clear position, so they all looked confusing all the time. The noodle was nice and pork too, however the broth not creamy and meaty enough for me. Chicken  skewers was nice. Gyoza was nothing special."
9,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great ramen place in Amsterdam. The head chef Taka which previously held a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù ramen kitchen above an Asian supermarket has gone more mainstream with this new restaurant. ‚Ä¶
10,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Small restaurant with simple menu, ramen is a good choice, however the cold ramen dishes are overall a bit disappointing: duck super dry, eel not as good as expected. Guess you just need to know what to order."
11,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Simply my fav Japanese restaurant in town.
A cozy place, where dumplings are amazing, the takoyaki even better, and last but not least tasty big portions of ramen!
Always a great time while here, guaranteed!"
12,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I love this place! Real authentic ramen and their dumplings were super delicious! The only thing is they have a real small menu and sadly enough they almost use pig soup stock for every dish. It would be nice if they had something with chicken!
13,Betsu Bara, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The ramen are some of the best I've ever had, but the service was terrible. The staff dropped the check on out table while we weren't finished yet, my friend was still drinking his beer that was half full. It was only 20:45 on a Friday ‚Ä¶"
14,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing Ramen place - TANTAN Ramen and Vegan Gyoza are highly recommended.
Big portions as well!
Can‚Äôt wait to come back again."
15,Betsu Bara, 2 stars ,7 months ago,They raised their prices and halved their portion size. Even my partner who has a low appetite walked out hungry. Not to mention the food they serve is somehow semi-cold. ‚Ä¶
16,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,a year ago,Lovely food&service. I do hope they will add clear ramen stock in vegetarian version soon.
17,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is great , but a bit too loud and noizy ..
Also the ramen is a bit expenssiv there but the broth is good .. yes is not for me the best ..."
18,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food bad waiter!

I enjoyen a lot the food and the place but a restaurant is no only food. ‚Ä¶"
19,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great Ramen, like Japan but even bigger portions of meat, loved it"
20,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The dumplings here is really nice! Ramen is actually better than most of the ramen places, while the egg is too salty somehow."
21,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice hidden away small restaurant & bar!  Good couple of options for vegetarians here & the atmosphere is relaxed & in simple setting... I ordered the veg Ramen with kimchi, very good üëåüëåüëå love it. Will surely be back ü§∏"
22,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Has a nice ramen. Enjoyed it. A bit different than the others I tried until now. Per total would recommend
23,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Lovely vegan ramen! Perfect lockdown-comfort-food. And btw, go pick it up yourself if you have the chance, you can call ahead and they‚Äôll have it ready for you. Supporting your locals is best done by actually buying from your locals, not from the delivery platforms who charge the restaurants very high commission rates ;-)."
24,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,a year ago,"THE BEST PLACE TO HAVE RAMEN IN AMSTERDAM
The food was incredible and the service Was Great also. ‚Ä¶"
25,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Generous portion of tasty ramen, what else? Oh yes, super cool staff as well !"
26,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,a year ago,"5 stars for great food here, normally we are regular customers. But the female waitress here is extremely rude and unprofessional. She rolled her eyes, had a very unfriendly body language and said ""Fine! What do you want?!"" when I tried to ‚Ä¶"
27,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The BEST noodles!!! Didn't even think to take a photo until I stopped for air halfway through.
28,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best ramen in Amsterdam! Delicious broth and fresh, tasty condiments. The yaki udon noodles with porkbelly is the tastiest noodle dish I've ever had. You can taste that everything's made with care and love. Definitely will return and recommend."
29,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have no doubt that you can get the best ramen in Amsterdam at Betsubara! The broth was perfect and the rest of the ingredients fresh and nicely prepared. I enjoyed it a lot! THANKS
30,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great find! Cool little Japanese place. Authentic taste. Excellent service. Will be back for sure!
31,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Incredible vegan ramen! I am not vegetarian nor vegan so I know what a good meat broth tastes like. Very few restaurants can claim having a meat broth competitor until you've been to Betsubara! ‚Ä¶
32,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing vegan ramen and coctails!!
33,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food, amazing service and really knowledge of cocktails"
34,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Ramen was delicious! Only downside: a friend of us ordered vegetarian ramen and she had to eat alone because ours came like 15mins after... not the best service, but we'll give it another try for sure!"
35,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Come early since like this venue like any proper Ramen place does not take reservations. Miso noodles are the best in the city in my humble opinion. Also they have this nice locally made ginger-orange lemonade.
36,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The atmosphere is nice and everything, but the food and service are mediocre and slow. We arrived when the restaurant was just opened and there were literally two tables, yet the service personell took quite long to take our orders and ‚Ä¶"
37,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Favorite ramen spot in the city. It‚Äôs a little pricey, but the service is friendly and attentive and the quality of the dishes make it worthwhile. Would highly recommend the Tantan Men Ramen!"
38,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food (noodle soup) was good. Service was extremely slow though. Took about 40 minutes between ordering and getting the soup. No apologies or so - a bit like we should have felt privileged to be able to eat there at all.
39,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It was truly a pleasure to sit down with a giant bowl of delightful vegan ramen in this cute little establishment
40,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the Tan Tan Men ramen and it was one of the best ramen I had in my life. Cocktails are excellent, classic drinks with a Japanese twist. Staff were polite & friendly."
41,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A delightful addition to the burgeoning, vibrant Oud-West scene, as Taka Japanese Kitchen expands from its previous sole venue in Stormsteeg. The best ramen in Amsterdam? Probably, and the addition of counter seating, so typical of ‚Ä¶"
42,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice restaurant, serves really good tasting ramen and a variety of great Japanese style cocktails. The service was perfect, very nice staff."
43,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The ramen are delicious. The miso one and the spicy one are really good. Good beers choice  It definitely worth a 4strs. But the side are less than average. The service it is less than average as well. So it's just 3strs .
44,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Maybe I came on an off day or something because these ratings are high and I don‚Äôt share the same opinion based on my experience. Found the noodles a bit over cooked and the broth lacked a bit of the depth I was looking for. ‚Ä¶
45,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is a bit small and gets crowded in the evening, but food is really good and not expensive at all. Tho, there isn't much choice except of ramen. Nontheless, I liked it and would definitely go again."
46,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"the tonkotsu ramen was very very good, authentic taste and all. u would have loved an extra woomph from more kimchi. beer and drinks selection üëå top!"
47,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"New tantan men, so gr8, this broth is to die for"
48,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We went with out 11 month old baby the staff are very friendly and they accomodated us when we asked for the pork and pork broth to be replaced with chicken. The portions were great and they were very fast although it was a Saturday and the place was full
49,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really great Ramen served in a cool laid back atmosphere. I would highly recommend everybody to come here once.  Staff member Duncan is a true champ.
50,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"excellent ramen, maybe the best in Amsterdam"
51,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The environment is very informal and friendly but I didn't love the ramen, too much season on the chasiu and too much pepper generally . Good gyoza, very informal service!"
52,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,a year ago,Still one of the best ramen in my life
53,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"A great place in Amsterdam if you are looking for Japanese food.
Kids friendly üôÇ"
54,Betsu Bara, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff but the ramen can be improved a bit.
For some reason all ramens tasted the same. The kimchi was too much in the ramen. ‚Ä¶"
55,Betsu Bara, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is fast and friendly. Atmosphere is pretty chill and the food is great. I had a miso, broth was good kimchi was great!"
56,Betsu Bara, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great spot, great food, had to wait approx 45 minutes after ordering the food but we were with 5 and during peak time (19:45) so somewhat understandable. Kind staff, definitely recommend."
