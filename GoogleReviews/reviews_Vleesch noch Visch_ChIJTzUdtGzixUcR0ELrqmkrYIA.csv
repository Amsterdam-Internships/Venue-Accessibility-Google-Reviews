0,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I tried them for a first time and enjoyed a delicious soup and a gyros pita - really excellent taste, no need for meat anymore!"
1,Vleesch noch Visch, 4 stars ,a month ago,"The gyros are nice. Nice bread especially, but don‚Äôt go here very often because I do find it quite expensive"
2,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the most delicious vegan style gyros I have ever had and I am Greek so I can have an opinion üòä. I am not vegan but this was extremely tasty üòã. Yummy! Fresh ingredients, soya made gyros in a very cute environment. The Pommes üçü are also tasty. The only thing is that is a bit expensive but it‚Äôs worth."
3,Vleesch noch Visch, 4 stars ,5 months ago,The pita was absolutely amazing! Subtracted one star as the fries I had one time were disgusting (while I love fries in general) and the rucola salad name is more tomato cucumber salad with some rucola. However I have ordered their pita several times as love it a lot!
4,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I absolutely love their pita!
3 options, all worth it and mouthwatering (vegan).
Great price and lovely location where you can comfortably sit as well.
One of my favourite in the neighborhood."
5,Vleesch noch Visch, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice food, but they're getting more and more expensive... First they add another euro to the fries (they're friggin 4,50EU !!!!), now they don't even add any bloody mayo or sause to the fries... Price / quality ratio that they're ‚Ä¶"
6,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious veggie gyros (fresh, nice bread etc), and very good fries!"
7,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The gyros is great, super tasty, I‚Äôve had it many times.

I wish they would have some homemade drinks (ayran/ mango lassi / chendol) to go with the wraps üòä"
8,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very very delicious variations of Gyro pitas in vegan/vegetarian style no meat. They taste amazing - my favourite is the Tikka Masalla Gyro it's like 1000 times better than the original it should be the default gyro all over the world
9,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a year ago,First visit this year (food-truck with outdoor seating) and so good to see that this is still a great place! They were really busy yesterday evening with all the orders for deliveries but still so friendly and the gyros wrap was so good - ‚Ä¶
10,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The smell was so good I had to stop by. A
the food was beyond anything I expected!! The vegetarian gyros was incredible even for a meat lovers like me! But the staff was the real star of the meal. Caring and attentive they took care of as I was family. I'll definitely come back ü•∞"
11,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great food! fast service, happy employees"
12,Vleesch noch Visch, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Spent 11.50 euros on a Pita Mi Gado and a coke. The pita, wrapped in a paper cone, looked pitifully small to me, however it filled me right up, didn't need anything else for an hour or two. The pita was filled with stir fried shredded soy ‚Ä¶"
13,Vleesch noch Visch, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Fast, delicious and cheap vegetarian/vegan street food."
14,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a year ago,Absolutely delicious!! It was hard to believe how tasty the soy-based gyros was. Great small spot for a snack or lunch with outdoor seating or to go.
15,Vleesch noch Visch, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I'm real fun of Greek gyros but their Tzatziki had no garlic at all. We've been told that Dutch don't like it garlicky so that's why they skip it. Also we asked for like 5-6 fries in the pita, just like Greeks do and they told us we needed ‚Ä¶"
16,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great taste and texture. The menu is not large, but they do really well what they do! I've tried both the pita gyros and the veggie tikka massala and both are very tasty. The terrace is nice (there's no indoor space), but they also work with many delivery services."
17,Vleesch noch Visch, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I had the pita mi gado tonight. Very tasty but almost cold. Also the portion could be a bit bigger.
The gyros Iwhich I had the first time is much too bland and needs more garlic in the sauce"
18,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a year ago,"So good everytime! Always fast, warm and yummy! Just what you need when you are in a rush and looking for something filling, not expensive and vegan. Strongly recommend!"
19,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Amazing vegan options. Super delicious tikka masala pita and fries with vegan mayo. Highly recommend!
20,Vleesch noch Visch, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The vegan gyros they have here is great. Unfortunately the sauce was only on top of the wrap which made the rest of it quite dry. Still pretty good though.
21,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A must visit even if you are not a vegetarian. The gyro and Tikka masala options were so good, we went back a second time. It is a good cart so it doesn't have indoor seating and may have a bit of a wait but it is more than worth it."
22,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Well known for their gyros vleesch noch visch is always living up to my vegetarian expectations. Their other menu items are just as good and I would definitely recommend them to others. Price is just right and the service is always friendly, even if they are very busy."
23,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a year ago,All the vegan pitas are good but the Pita mi Gado is fantastic! The price is fair and they are making them quite quickly.
24,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Couldn't read the menu but was told to go for the Gyro. I couldn't tell you a single ingrediant in it but I can say that it was The BEST Gyro I have ever had! Absolutely Amazing! Unfortunately no picture because I ate it too fast.
25,Vleesch noch Visch, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I ordered 2 meals there (for 2 people each, so food for 4 people in total). The Deliveroo rider arrived with the wrong order (which was much much smaller, and for Uber eats). The rider offered to go back and pick up the right order, even ‚Ä¶"
26,Vleesch noch Visch, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Vegan pita's. Taste is good but.. these portions are crazy small. And for the price, I expect more. For this reason ill rate it 2 stars."
27,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Get the Pita Mi Gado. You will not regret it.
28,Vleesch noch Visch, 1 star ,2 years ago,"expensive, the food just veggies in a bread with a pinch of sous(extremly spicy). don t recommend it even if you are e vegan. the worst vegan food i‚Äôve ever tasted"
29,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food at an affordable price. Most options are vegan, but both vegans and non-vegans will love the taste."
30,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Incredible spot, best vegan food in Amsterdam hands down. Cheap, delicious, friendly staff. 5/5!"
31,Vleesch noch Visch, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect snack place if your vegetarian, a bit pricey considering it's veg though. Ample seating, but didn't have any milk or creamer for coffee when I went there"
32,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"amazing vega gyros, quality pita, fresh tsatsiki, big portions, friendly service! Really a true gem! Absolutely great :)"
33,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Vegan haven. Loved it
Make sure to try their fries, they're legendary."
34,Vleesch noch Visch, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little stop for vegetarians, and the food was very tasty. The service was a bit slow though, but maybe because we arrived as soon as they opened."

Great choice of vegan Pitas. ‚Ä¶"
36,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stunned by the intense flavors, especially the indonesian one. I came around closing time but the staff still took the time to help me with a smile! Thanks"
37,Vleesch noch Visch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The most amazing little place to takeaway or to sit down on the benches and tuck in. Vegan gyros and tikka masala are amazing. Card only.
