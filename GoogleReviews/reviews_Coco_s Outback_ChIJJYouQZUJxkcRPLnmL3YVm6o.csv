0,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We grabbed a beer here during the Halloween day, the bar was very effectively decorated, it was a nice atmosphere here. The only drawback - the tables could be cleaner. Perhaps the staff was busy due to Halloween."
1,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great place to watch a football game. The staff went out of there way to find the game that I wanted to watch on one of the screens. They could only get a stream at first, but then managed to find it on one of the channels later on. It was ‚Ä¶"
2,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,4 months ago,Worst service ever. Waited to get in with the staff looking at us and other customers waiting and carried on chatting so we just seated ourselves. Had a QR code on the table to order then after 10 minutes of waiting for the payment to go ‚Ä¶
3,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Being back at Cocos after such a long time was so nostalgic! This place was always a favorite during my university years. From their Wednesday international student nights to their pub quizzes, karaoke nights and also watching sports here ‚Ä¶"
4,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Definitely not worth your money if you plan on eating (we notuced people come here to drink). We were told that 3/4 of the menu basically wasn't available and then we got what is pictured. Potatoes skin and cheese.. for 10,90 euros."
5,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a year ago,"So great we went back twice in the same trip.
Food is incredible, huge portions and a great selection.
Drinks are just on another size level, absolutely brilliant.
Service was great and being in Rembrandt Square added to the atmosphere."
6,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious food and drinks. I particularly love the Caipirinha and we have tried Kangaroo burgers which were also great !
7,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was good however, the baked chicken lacked seasoning. My biggest disappointment was the service. At 1600 hours with limited people there, the Server did not check on us during our meal and the order of our first drinks took forever. ‚Ä¶"
8,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Really great bar with a range of beers and cocktails. Reasonably priced, we got the nachos which is a great beer snack . Wish google gave half points because the only that let this place down was the service which honestly made it a 3.5 I don't blame the servers but more the management"
9,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 months ago,The best part is that they are one of the rare places in Netherlands that care to stream cricket. It was a fun night to watch India vs Pakistan t20 cup there. However I felt that the drinks were a little overpriced.
10,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"We came to Coco's on a Monday night and ordered Ribs and Kangaroo Burger.
Portions are big.
Ribs is enough for 2 people and burgers are more than enough to fill you but the ‚Ä¶"
11,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We loved this place and wish we had found it earlier. It's seems to be a hangout for college age crowd, but they were nice to us older folks anyway. The cocktails were delightful, the nachos yummy and the Kangaroo Burger was an experience! We went there twice and would have gone again had we been in Amsterdam for more time."
12,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Australian themed pub. The outside is drab and looks nothing like the interior at all. Staff are polite and friendly. They've got a pool table and darts if you fancy a game. The place is split over 3 levels. There is a snug on the 2nd floor ‚Ä¶
13,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Place is located in a very popular area of Amsterdam, close to Flower Market too. ‚Ä¶"
14,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a month ago,Only place i found in Amsterdam to see the Celtic game on tv when it wasn't on Sky etc. Cheers Adrian HH  Good bucket deals and shots üëç
15,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Brilliant Australian bar with a really cool theme to it. Has so much different sport on in there its a pub you can stay in all day. Drinks are reasonably priced and they are what they are.  Staff are friendly and welcoming. They have a large array of different seating as well.
16,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Had a lovely experience! The cocktails are amazing, the atmosphere was lovely, and the service was simply outstanding. ü•∞ I can definitely recommend the Gummy Bear Martini."
17,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place for a beer or two/three/fourü§£ü§£ waitress was Irish so couldn't tell me about the Aussie habits, but okay, I'll be coming back and have some more beers ü§£ü§£! ‚Ä¶"
18,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"At first glace the burgers looked amazing, but honestly they are the driest burgers that I have ever eaten. Service is quite slow as the seating area is really big. The quality of the ingredients were good. They have kangaroo meat if you are up for trying new things."
19,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was great to try this place. Quite good variety of beers and cocktails, many snacks(portions super huge). Higly recommend macho nachos! Tooks the vegetarian version and it surprised me a lot, as usually I am meet lover, taste was great:) ‚Ä¶"
20,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Coco's is a good stop in Amsterdam! Nice vibe both inside and outside. Amsterdam-ish prices, on the slightly higher end. Staff can be a bit stressed when it's busy, which reflects in being slightly impatient/less helpful."
21,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A nice place to hangout with friends. They have pretty cheap beer üçª and international music. They have discounts if you‚Äôre a ESN member. ‚Ä¶
22,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Please tell the DJ to play better sets cause the timing is all off and frustrating, the songs do not go in the correct vibe it‚Äôs ruining the nights please - I‚Äôve been here before and it‚Äôs been great but the last few weeks have just not vibed - apart from that it‚Äôs great üëçüèº"
23,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Best place in Amsterdam to watch Live sports like the Rugby. Great vibe, loads of Big screen TV's everywhere and lots of seating inside and out. It's very crowded during big live games and can be difficukt to order a drink or a meal, but ‚Ä¶"
24,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a month ago,Thea & Leonardo were AMZAZING servers!!!! much love for them and cocos is amazing in terms of drinks and service!!! 10/10 ü§©
25,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"I waited over 2,5 hours for a burger. It should be a pretty simple order. The burger tasted okay, maybe it was because I was so hungry."
26,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Really overpriced even for the centre of Amsterdam. Had the burger with fries, burger was mediocre and the fries were way too thick and not well cooked. Also, 8.50 for a pint..? ‚Ä¶"
27,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious but heavy food for a very good price (Mondays it‚Äôs cheaper)! Huge portions.
28,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food and friendly staff. Had a good clubnight on saturday, music was awesome"
29,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There slogan..... Lousy Food and Warm Beer.... IN FACT - its the complete opposite. The food is amazing, the choice is wide from South African food, British food and Australian food. Their is always plenty to choice from. Plus an extensive ‚Ä¶"
30,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to watch live sports if you're a homesick Australian who misses Aussie rules. Decent enough beers on tap and always cheap shots. Pretty good food too, especially for a pub breakfast. The staff will look after you"
31,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great ambiance on the terrace but inside as well. We were lucky enough to get the Monday discount and the food was good. The chicken and ribs were amazing (actually half of a chicken).
32,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Most people that come to Amsterdam don't realize that it's 1/10 the size and actually more culturally diverse than NYC. If you like traveling, enjoy being around people of all different walks of life from all over the world,  a tremendous ‚Ä¶"
33,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great Aussie pub ! Lovely atmosphere to watch the AFL!! Vegan options available ! Really good menu with plenty of options to suit everyone's needs !
34,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,a month ago,Service is super slow and they refuse the split the bill even when you are in a table with 10 people. Ridiculous
35,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The guy serving us seemed to be pissed of with something, plus the burger that would be just ok had a ridiculously burned meet, which ruined the taste! The chips were really good, though"
36,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved it here. Excellent for American football in amsterdam. Great customer vibe, and service was amazing. Food was tasty üòò"
37,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 months ago,It was really crowded so a bit hard to find a seating place. You can order from the table using an app that is a bonus.
38,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Sports pub with many screens. They seem to stream all leagues. If your team is not on screen, ask the staff."
39,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, excellent food, have a game you don't want to miss, this is the place go be."
40,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Food here is HORRENDOUS, bread from the sandwich is literally impossible to cut with a knife, asked for a burger with medium doneness got well done, you'd get a better burger from McDonald's, fries are over cooked and completely unseasoned, ‚Ä¶"
41,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"This Australian Outback pub is one of my most frequented bars in Amsterdam over the past half a decade ! Friendly staff, good selection of alcohol esp. in beers and cocktails and if you're a fan or want to try exotic Australian delicacy ‚Ä¶"
42,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Great bar. Lovely food and drinks
43,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Very attrictive place, we waited only a few minutes then got a table. However as soon as we sat down, we waited for 15 min for someone to take our order, we got up and left. High expectations but was a letdown."
44,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Some of the best burgers we have eaten so far!
It is not only a good place to have some Drinks, they also offer really great food! ‚Ä¶"
45,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place and atmosphere food and beer was great also
46,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lively bar with good beer and cocktail selection. Happy hour is from 9-10pm
47,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Most popular sports catered for on multiple big screens easy walk from tram stop at Rembrandtplein
48,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Coco's tried to charge us double (!) the amount of what we ordered. Luckily we were not that drunk as they probably hoped and started a dispute. And despite being obviously wrong, their manager was very pushy giving us some unclear ""partly ‚Ä¶"
49,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,havent eaten there but went for drinks and dancing.  drinks were good and music was good... my friends and I had a great time there. easily one of my new favorite spots
50,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Service can be a bit slow if it‚Äôs busy but the drinks are cheap and the burger was tasty and big.
51,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great drinks. Nice food. Super nice and helpful staff
52,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,8 months ago,Crazy non sense expensive food . Coffee it‚Äôs at least do this good and service is invisible. Not good at all ( point on 2018-9 we have great time and food there ) last visits are disappointing.
53,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Super Pub, love everything!!"
54,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is awesome,  the food is good and tasty, it is recommended."
55,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We stopped here just for a drink. Menu looked pretty good, there are some typical Australian dishes available, a few vegetarian options and a couple of vegan. They were showing different sports on the bar tv, including AFL."
56,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,a year ago,We were there with a group of 10 people and had plenty of cocktails. Staff was unfriendly and not able to split a bill (even though the prices are super easy because all cocktails have the same price).  In the end one person paid all after ‚Ä¶
57,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Being Australian we wanted to give this bar a go. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Burgers were huge and amazing!!! cocktails great price and delicious. Lockers to leave things in upstairs when u want to walk around without extra things ‚Ä¶
58,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible place for corporate or coworker drinks. The Wednesday night bouncer was incredibly rude and cared more about maintaining his macho bravado than providing a good customer experience. Will not be coming back here for after work ‚Ä¶
59,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff were friendly, had half price Monday so it was excellent value for the food, very large portion. However I think the patty in my burger is actually too thick and hard to eat the burger. The ribs has rooms for improvement. Atmosphere is nice. Pretty chilled outside ."
60,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Really like this place, not super cheap and pretty tourist-y but I really enjoy the esspreso martinis, the staff are always friendly and the sweet potato fries are great. Great for couples and larger groups looking for a bit of life, or drinks on a terrace!"
61,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,a year ago,Lukewarm beer and lousy food? Lies. Good looking restaurant if you want beer and some food in the gut. The menu took a little quality hit over the years but the Aussie specialties are still a rare treat. If the chefs read this: use that old ‚Ä¶
62,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very busy bar in a great spot on the square, well worth a visit"
63,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cheap (but strong) cocktails, lively all the time, good food and pretty fun ""events"" every other night. It's a really great place, especially if you're a student (cheaper drinks during happy hours!) Only downside is waiting a bit longer for orders when you're outside."
64,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a few drinks and meal here. No vegan options in evening, however chef was nice enough to make me grilled sandwich from the day time menu."
65,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely staff, spacious place and delicious food. Been there in a weekday, pretty easy to find seats. Tried ribs, burger and roo fillet. Portion of ribs could have been bigger. Definitely recommend the burger."

Just had drinks here with friends. ‚Ä¶"
67,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm not so much of a fan of the club itself, but I've enjoyed a few drinks and snacks on their terrace. It's a good, affordable and casual spot, although I wouldn't spend my night out here (too crowded and sweaty). However, I will give a ‚Ä¶"
68,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place seems interesting, being a sports bar and almost always busy, but the food is not that great. Got myself a burger which didn't taste that good. Not salty at all. Same for my friend who got different type of meat. However, the size ‚Ä¶"
69,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place in the center of amsterdam. Good music, quick service, nice staff.."

72,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cool club in city center. Has a lot of delicious coctails. Music is super cool and for everyone :)
73,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,Do yourself a favour and don‚Äôt spend a single dime here. I have never experienced worst customer service. Every single worker in this place has a huge chip on their shoulder. There are many bars in Amsterdam that will have better friendlier staff to have a great time with
74,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A Nice place to take a beer or a cocktail while you see your team or sport idol play. A good place to enjoy sport and hung out with your friends. On game days they tent to be full and you're not allowed to enter. A crazy atmosphere of beer and TV everywhere.
75,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We often pop into Coco's Outback when we're in Amsterdam. It's a good place to chill out for an hour or two with a few drinks to relax after a busy day. ‚Ä¶
76,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A really great place that makes me wonder why I haven't been there sooner. Very cozy atmosphere, better than the typical Dutch service, nice beers, very nice cocktails and very delicious food. Aside from the kangaroo burger that I didn't ‚Ä¶"
77,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Always friendly staff, nice snacks, my favourite place to go out to grab some beers"
78,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a month ago,Love the place and the drinks!
79,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Beer tastes like water. Would not recommend. Also overpiced
80,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Never thought to go into this place, but glad I did. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Can be a bit of a wait at busy evenings, since it will be packed. But food is pretty good and combined with the laidback aussie atmosphere it's a ‚Ä¶"

82,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cannot recommend this place enough if you are stuck for somewhere to eat in the city and want something quick and tasty. We'd already eaten dinner but headed in when we caught sight of some of the cocktails that people were drinking and ‚Ä¶
83,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice bar with a good vibe. The majority of people coming here are experts and tourists, but that gives Coco‚Äôs its backpackers-air which I usually start to miss when I‚Äôve been home for a while. This is the kind of place where you make ‚Ä¶"
84,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fun atmosphere, good beer selection. Bathroom might be one of the more disgusting places I've ever stepped into but it's a bar so I wasn't expecting the cleanest thing. Would I take a first date here? No. Would I take my bros here? Definitely."
85,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Italian waitress lovely girl. So friendly and kind.
Other girl with curly and brown hair, so rude. She thinks better than everyone else. ‚Ä¶"
86,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to have a cold pint of beer and some comfort food. Fun atmosphere, hard working staff, and a wonderful place to just sit and take in the city. A must if you're wandering through the streets of Amsterdam!"
87,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If it's Monday, go for food, it's half price and a great deal.  Drinks are well priced and good.  Go for a pitcher of martinis.  They have 2 happy hours, one at 6 and I think 8? Where the drinks are cheaper.  A Monday at 6 is a good end to the day."
88,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great big sports bar showing lots of football and other sports. Staff were very happy to put on a Scottish game for us on the TV next to our table. Great drink offers as well.
89,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Students. Everywhere. Drunk students.

It's not bad at all. You can have test tube shots, Heineken buckets and cocktail ‚Ä¶"
90,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,3 years ago,Don't bother. Went there thinking that the earlier reviews must be wrong and were served drinks very quickly but then the waitress only came back when we had enough of waiting to order food and basically yelled at her. Far more interested ‚Ä¶
91,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good atmosphere, good selection of beer, average bar food.

Coco's has a good vibe and is a great place for expats and locals alike to mix ‚Ä¶"
92,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We walked by to see what they have and they convinced me with their drink specials and variety of interesting foods. I got a kangaroo burger medium rare and it was delicious! Also ordered a basket of Bitterballen and a bucket of Desperados. If I lived in Amsterdam, I'd probably call this my favorite place."
93,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"There are better bars in Rembrandtplein for sure. The food is just meh, does not taste good. The beer collection is okay and cocktails are ordinary too. The place gets extremely crowded on weekends. Staff is friendly enough. Horrible ‚Ä¶"
94,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely bar with a special theme: backpackers caf√©. I had a great time here with my friends. There is a good party vibe and the bar personnel is very friendly. It got my attention that the bar is visited by a lot of different nationalities. Fun!
95,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Booked a table for 17.30, no service at all when we walked through the door. We waited at the bar for 10 minutes with no service, finally got attention from one of the staff and was then ushered to another staff member. Unfriendly and not welcoming, disappointing when you're expecting a warm aussie welcoming."
96,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"My wife and I here last night at about 7pm, it was fairly quiet at that time with everyone sitting relaxing. We both had the best burgers we have ever eaten and the person that served us was very nice and enthusiastic. We are going back again tonight!"
97,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Location was good. the look of it as well. Bad and unfriendly service! Only brought 5 meals for 6 people (nevertheless we asked before if she had 6 orders - she doublechecked and had 6 orders). Food was ok but nothing special. The service ‚Ä¶
98,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Pretty grimy and really dated in it's portayal of Australian culture. However I guess it's a good place of you want to watch a sports match or get wasted. They do food but I couldn't have any as it didn't appear they knew what was gluten-free or not. If that's not a problem for you - they have kangaroo!
99,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome staff, awesome massive place! Watched Wales v NZ here and it was great. We came back that evening to have some food and it was AMAZING. I recommend the GIANT burger"
100,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great party, excellent music, best happy hour and 2x1 cocktails. Food is delicious and portions are quite generous. It's the right place to meet locals and tourists."
101,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I can have fun nearly anywhere I go, also depending on who I'm with but what I dislike the most about Coco's is men always trying to touch me, pull me or simply being drunk and trying to get on me even after a simple rejection. No means no. ‚Ä¶"
102,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good atmosphere and plenty chance to watch sports in this one. With its central location a good spot for anyone visiting Amsterdam that loves pints... expensive ones though... which is the only downside.
103,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was absolutely amazing. It is you typical bar grill type food though. I would not recommend if you were looking for something ""not so american"". The do had Kangaroo burgers and such which is very different. I couldnt being my self to trying it though. On mondays they have 50% burgers and other items. Overall very well priced."
104,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,Disgusting. I had the falafel burger with bbq saus and onion rings. everything was dripping  with fat. The falafel was super  mushy and it honestly just tasted like oil. Everything got soggy and even the fries were mushy. Also very loud and dirty table. Staff didnt pay attention to us at all
105,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,5 months ago,The cocktails were bad and the service is HORRIBLE
106,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food simple but done well. As a chef that's what u want. Burger I had was med well crispy on the edges  juicy in the middle 8 euro for it. Only problem was the price of drink 8 euro for a pint.
107,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Hey. What can I say. It was ok. A bit dated and lots of TV screens. But they serve biltong and showed Rugby. And I'm South African. So why not 5 stars? It's an Australian pub. And us south Africans are not that friendly with them when it comes to sport. üòõ
108,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice cold beer! Food was good but pretty expensive!
109,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great sports bar lots of screens and good food. Crowded at times
110,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service is fine, cocktails taste artificial and the nachos with meat come with sweet chili sauce instead of salsa, which I dont really understand. They also dont have any hot sauce (even tabasco would be fine). Their sports broadcast is pretty nice"
111,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Me and my wife have just been living in Amsterdam four a couple of months, and Coco's has already become the place to go to meet friends and start the night (maybe even stay there all night! :D). ‚Ä¶"
112,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good burgers, and definitely worth the half price they have on Monday, or through a coupon on Groupon. Not sure if I would feel the same if I paid the full price."
113,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"In need of an amazing dinner and good time? Get the huge chicken burger with bacon and cheeze, 2 long island ice teas, followed by a large beer. Stay till around 23:00 and the place will be transformed into a club with great music and ‚Ä¶"
114,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice food, highly recommend the chicken parmi! The giant burger is also very nice, cocktails are good size for the price, especially during happy hour"
115,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very good nachos and burgers. 5/5 would come again for a 3rd meal.
116,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is really good and hanging out is really fun! Watched the Patriots game and lost our phone there, got contacted before we could contact them, really nice waiters and staff!
Defenetly coming again."
117,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Horrible service, inedible food. Go somewhere else to watch sports. They made us wait an hour for fries and a burrito. The staff was bordering on rude whenever we enquiried. When the food finally arrived it was served with no apology. The ‚Ä¶"
118,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An amazing steakhouse!! The food was unbelievable and the service was great!! You would expect a high price tag to go with the quality of food and service, but however, the prices are really quite modest when compared with the likes of CAU which is just up the road."
119,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Pretty happy with the place. Went to watch some AFL footy while abroad and no problems. My partner hated the food and while I didn't think it was anything to write home about it was decent. Just being able to watch my team win the footy gives it 5 stars for mine. üòä
120,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best place to watch sports. Lots of screens,  good service. Watching Rugby World cup Final was fantastic . Place was filled with jovial South Africans"
121,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Not your upper end kinda bar, fantastic cocktails and food. I had a kangaroo pie which was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted and my husband had the fish an chips, which was also to die for. An half price Monday's. How could we complain."
122,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Good service, but awful food. Among the worst we found in Europe. The chicken was all dark meat, ick, and the ribs were average. The beer was stale. So many other options in the area, Skip this one for a cafe...or McDonalds lol."
123,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fun place with good burgers, burritos and beer :)"
124,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Located next to the Rembrandt square it's a good place to have a drink and chat with your friends and strangers next to you. Long picknick tables in front of the club are covered by large parasols to protect you and your friends from the ‚Ä¶
125,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Was here during superbowl. Nice atmosphere, they tried to help you as best as they can while the place was cramped with people. Just a pity that the monday deals don't start on monday 00.00 hours, but that is something we should be familiar with around these areas."
126,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place for some drinks and beers, the price is fair and the environment is great. Lots of TVs and you can ask for any match to be broadcasted on any TV"

128,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It was okay! Very very big student crowd, not my thing personally but if you're into it then it's great! Make sure you have your student ID at the door otherwise you're not allowed in. Cheap drinks also!"
129,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I had the tacos and pins colada and they were very mediocre. I had to ask for tap water 3 times. They kept trying to sell me sparkling water.  Other than poor service and mediocre food, it's a great place to people watch and soak up the great views."
130,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best ribs in town, very tender and tasty. It's a good place to hang around with friends for a beer and something to eat
Also each night there are sport events on tv.
The staff is friendly and helpful."
131,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,a year ago,Lovely place for sports and good. Unfortunately due the Corona the seats inside are wvery harsh to sit on and they didn't turn on the sound of the game.
132,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The ""Aussie"" place. As an Aussie, I had to go. Minus one star for no Lamingtons or pavlova (at least when I went), however the meat pies are there, which saves the day. Naturally I gravitated here when the Rugby was on, so it was packed more than council flat. Still, great place, decent grub and lovely staff."
133,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Typical touristy bar, the kind that could be in any touristic neighborhood anywhere else in the world. Bouncers are incredibly rude and are ready to block the entrance of those who disagree with them.. Once you're in, it's alright. They have some nice shots at the bar."
134,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The drinks and food were reasonably priced. They have a smoking section. 6 beers and 4 wines with 3 starters cost us 58‚Ç¨. Friendly and fast service.
135,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favorite bar in Rembrantplein. Their Monday discounts are outrageous. The servers are really quick and cheerful. Their internal decour is questionable, but I would just keep going back there for the cocktails, food and ambiance."
136,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"You need to have a crazy evening? Watch Sport Show ?  Some Aussi Fast Food ? or good Burger ?  Come here, if you do not mind high price drinks - ‚Ä¶"
137,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the better places in Amsterdam to go out. Interesting crowd can get a bit too busy. Only thing is they make you pay to pee.
138,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great spot to watch NFL on Sunday in Amsterdam. Seemed to have most games on, food was good (get the pies if you're hungry), and beer was flowing"
139,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been there a lot of times when it opens as a bar, never had an issue with getting inside, popular music with a nice dancefloor, the service is very good only down point is that it attracts a lot of creepy guys"
140,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Well, they don't really lie.  Lousy food and warm beer.  It's not that bad, really, but it isn't that great either. Good location, my salad was big, though pretty basic, and the beers were cold.  Meh."
141,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a year ago,"They serve amazing food, a really nice plays to hang out, great atmosphere, the staff is super friendly and fun to talk to, just an amazing place"
142,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Used to be my go-to bar for all my Sports events but the service got degraded and the prices are way too high. Occasionally I still drop by for beer. Heck their slogan says it all: Lousy Food and Warm Beer
143,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's different. It's rough and it could use someone with a ladder and a feather duster. But the burgers are just great! You need to try the kangaroo!!! Still waiting for them to add a third size after ""not so huge"" and ""huge"": ""really huge""! See you next year coco's!"
144,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beer, weed, awesome food, great atmosphere ! I would sleep over if they let me!! All low maintenance girlfriends with love for chicken strips will be more than satisfied! üíö"
145,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent on the night time for some drinks and cheap cocktails, food wasnt great but the menu does say 'lousy food' haha! Was still cool and one of the cheaper places to go in Waterlooplein."
146,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely to sit and watch the world go by,
good food
good drinks"
147,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Plenty of Aussieness, great atmosphere, food & people."
148,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a very nice disco pub with 3 Euros entree fee after 11 pm in the night. Before 11 pm, entry is absolutely free. Nice place with loud music."
149,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What can I say, Coco's is a game changer. Such a big venue, brimming with cheeky character and promising good times. On every occasion that brought me to Coco's, I've ended up leaving with a full belly, full heart, (very drunk) and with ‚Ä¶"
150,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,ü§Æ
151,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Australians, Brits and English speakers in general go here. They have good value shots and decent Strawberry daiquiri. There is a dance floor which is small but OK. Added value for karaoke Thursdays!"
152,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great vibe for the Rugby World Cup final!
153,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Lousy food, cold beer. Friendly people."
154,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent service! Lacky was extremely accommodating when I ordered, I have food intolerances and he went out of his way to satisfy my requests. Both Lacky and John were very friendly. The food, cocktails and service brought us back a second night and I would definitely return again!"
155,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is like my home bar for all the games and matches I watch. The beer is superb. The chicken wings are finger licking. The staff are so kind and swift.
156,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,40 minutes after the server last checked on my table I finally got someone‚Äôs attention.  The staff was more interested in talking with one another than servicing customers on a not so busy Sunday afternoon.  Terrible experience.
157,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,6 years ago,Never have I ever experienced racism by the staff of an establishment like I witnessed tonight as I watched my black friend get kicked out of a sponsored event because someone put his hat on his head. When I asked for the bouncers name who ‚Ä¶
158,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,3 years ago,Don‚Äôt waste your time. We went in and had a waitress come very quickly. The drinks came soon after but we were sitting for 45 mins and our food hadn‚Äôt been served. Such a waste.
159,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great location, chilled and laid back place to sit and enjoy the area. Burgers are delicious and staff are friendly and helpful. Look out for a beautiful ginger cat."
160,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The meal I chose (Kangaroo steak) was amazing, 1 star less because the Pepsi was brought directly served in a glass and without bottle, plus, it took more than one hour before we get our meals."
161,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Always crowded, slow service, ok atmosphere. Good for watching football matches with foreigners and tourists, used to have great crocodile burgers but the food has gone downhill in the past few years and drinks are overpriced so this is pretty much the only time you will find me there"
162,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Friendly staff and pretty decent food. Monday nights was half off food, so that made it worth it. Otherwise the food would've been too pricey. Fun atmosphere."
163,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cheap drinks (for Amsterdam standards). Drinking environment.  Good also for live sports.
If u want to have a nice drink night out with international people this is ur place."
164,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,5 years ago,If you like NFL football then this is place for you on a Sunday. All sorts of specials on offer. Just dont expect wine in a wine glass as they have no wine glasses. Cocktails not up to much
165,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are looking for some Amsterdam nightlife, I guess this is the place to be especially during the weekend. During the week you can still enjoy awesome burgers (and kinda huge) and good beers and cocktails, especially during the happy hour..."
166,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. And on Mondays it's 50% off ribs and chicken dishes. And it's huge. So good if pay the full price.
167,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfectly informal & casual sports screening bar!
And when the night comes around, its the perfect party spot as well !
Cheers to Coco's and their smoked chicken wings on a not so busy day!"
168,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Super bad service, fries were cold, they sold us two normal beers for a special beer, which cost much more (Zatte, my favorite beer) and didn‚Äôt even give us a new one. Super bad place / can‚Äôt recommend it"
169,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent burger, tasty, juicy and full of flavour and filling.

Friendly staff, good atmosphere. Well worth a visit!"
170,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,An enjoyable Monday 50% off food with the guys.  A beautiful waitress served us.  What more could you want (besides her phone number?)  Rianna from Slovakia? (Sp?).
171,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this place. Whether its just a drink on a weekday, watching a football match or clubbing on the weekend, its perfect for everything. Good choice of drinks and bites too!"
172,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,5 months ago,Took almost an hour to get our drinks
173,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Actually we had fun in this bar until the barkeeper (turns out to be the shop manager) served us dishwater. As we kindly asked for clean water he pitched a fit and wanted us to leave the club. He said ""you Germans always want tap water for ‚Ä¶"
174,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very loud music, impossible to talk, felt more like a poor disco than a pub. Terrible drinks. Popular place to watch games."
175,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,a year ago,Waiters were very spicy. Didnt wait till i was done talking and just walked away. Multiple times. They were all karens
176,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Tourist trap that should be avoided at all costs. There are so many better bars in Amsterdam, even in Rembrandtplein. For anyone who is not white, the bouncers and service express serious racism and this venue should be avoided at all costs."
177,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent place to watch NFL games (American football). Customer service was top notch, tons of TVs, great food and beer selection!"
178,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun place which gives me a real southern hemisphere feel. Big portions of food, lots of beer and always showing the rugby. 5/5"
179,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, good beer, good atmosphere. What more do you need?
Try out their pies, burgers or ribs coupled with some nice beers and you'll be back there before you know it."
180,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to come to watch football. I came during the World Cup and it was packed with spectators.  Service was a bit hard to come by, but considering the amount of people there it wasn't so bad."
181,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Stag's allowed. Entry is 3 Euro on Fridays. Locker charges 2 Euro coin. Spacious club. Good Music.Nice funky ambience.
182,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Tried to be Aussie but wayyyyy off. They prefferd to play NFL and EPL over a huge game between Sydney and Hawthorn . Played all the other stuff on big screens and all the ausies stuck in a corner on a tiny screen with EPL commented in the ‚Ä¶
183,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice atmosphere and great service, but oh man, their cocktails are the best! Creamiest pi√±a colada I've had in a long time"
184,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Best Kangaroo burger ever.
185,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I have one complain about this place that they forced me to go out because I was bearing my hat. I accept the rule but there were two girls wearing hats and no body talked to them. This is racism.
186,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good burritos. Nice of them to put on commentary for the America's Cup on request for a small contingent of Kiwis. Would have been even cooler on louder volume, but was nice of them to accommodate anyways."
187,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,3 years ago,The worst burger I ate in my life. Wasted money. The slogan of the restaurant ‚ÄúThe lousy food‚Äù is not a joke. It‚Äôs the right name for this place. So that‚Äôs what you get.
188,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Consistently decent hearty trashfood with huge portions, although a bit expensive. Great for a hangover lunch, they serve ""breakfast"" until six in the evening."
189,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Decent service. Nothing exceptional. Staff is friendly but you need to call out for them.. They are too busy and hard to find. Good place to watch sports
190,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,3 years ago,They show the worldcup soccer matches in 25fps interlaced standard definition analog signal. Single analog chinch connectors are used to feed the screens (!!) I have not seen that in the last 15 years. Crazy signal interference is added to increase the nostalgic feeling. Cheap drinks though.
191,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Aussie pub with the feel of home
Plenty of space and lots of big screens to watch your favourite sport..  excellent food at a great price... üôåüèª"
192,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great Restaurant with awesome Food and Drinks.
193,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Warm beer and lousy drinks - their slogan says it all.
The service is oriented towards cranking orders rather than making you feel comfortable, and the athmosphere is something of a mixture between a divebar and a ‚Ä¶"
194,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to pile in and watch sports. Staff were happy to put Rugby League on the tv too so they even cater for minority sports ü§£
195,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great (sports) bar for juicy but cheap burgers, amazing cocktails, and a lot of different drinks. Good for large groups as well."
196,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Massive burgers and great cocktails but low on staff so tool forever to order and pay as there was only a single girl serving outside but plenty of staff inside not busy at all
197,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Beware of pick-pocketing. I have been going to Cocos for a while now for its friendly staff and easygoing ambient, however I have heard of 2 robberies in a space of 2 weeks. I don't feel comfortable there anymore."
198,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Happening place.Cheaper drinks.Fully crowded after 11 pm.Large dance floor and cheerful people.I have been repeatedly going here,as I loved the ambiance.Toilet is nice and we'll maintained."
199,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The multi screen behemoth that‚Äôs a staple of stag dos. Weekends it can get messy. Good drink deals always. Pub quiz is also good
200,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place to have beer, play pool and chill. People are friendly and good service"
201,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good cafe, good food, a great selection of drinks and a good atmosphere during football matches. If you come to Amsterdam, visit this site and you will not make a mistake in that I am sure. !!!üëåüëåüëåüëå"
202,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Great food !!! Slow but super friendly service - definitely a party spot and one of the best sports bars in Amsterdam
203,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Basic tourist pub with bad music and standard drinks. On the plus side it has a lot of seating and a smoking section near the dance floor if you go for that.
204,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I cant decided between 3 or 4*.
The bar itself is okay, people look okay, outside sitting for smokers, during night time party and dj. Drinks anyway are the same everywhere.
Its just not.. you know.. The final ingrediance is missing for that place!"
205,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very racist looking bar with the poorly attempted aboriginal artwork. A schooner of VB is way over priced and the music is always very average
206,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Didn't have any food but the beer was cold and multiple kinds on tap. Karaoke was fun to watch and Im sure more fun try.
207,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,6 years ago,The place itself isn't great but expats often have their first visit here and sometimes several times after. Which means the place is great if you're new in town and you're struggling with Dutch.
208,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We spent more than 2 hours waiting for simple dishes (nachos, wings). When the food arrived it was not fresh, and it was cold. Bad experience."
209,Coco's Outback, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I was in the bar last night,  26th Nov and I took a funny turn and vomited heavily - maybe 4 times i recognise this was fairly disgusting and I could have maybe vomited in a number of other places so I offered to clean it up and gave the chap 20 Euro but still was made to feel awkward about it"
210,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very central spot, Jamaican Jerk Chicken actually tasted like the real Jamaican Jerk! üëçüèºSpareribs meat even fell of the bones üî•üî•üî•ü•≥"

221,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Expensive, dirty, with terrible food and bad beer selection. They also charge you to use the toilets which I have never seen before in this country. Only tourists with no clue of where to go in this city would consider going here. Avoid!"
222,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Adrian is an amazing bartender, really made me feel welcome and had great banter to back up his terrible hairstyle, give that man a raise!"
223,Coco's Outback, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place to meet tourists and have a good time. They have cheap beer and snacks. After midnight it feels like a night club
224,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Pretty good place to go to if you want to chill out and meet new people from all over the world. Staff are super friendly and it has a good vibe before 11pm

230,Coco's Outback, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Security staff super rude and unprepared to handle people, my friends and I had a terrible experience there, abuse of power and totally unnecessary use of force. I used to recomend this place to everyone, not anymore. Never coming back"

238,Coco's Outback, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Is your outback burning with excitement? Or can you not wait to go walkabout? If you answered yes to any of these questions then stop. Wait a minute. Turn around two and a half times and look up. What do you see? The sky, or the original dreamtime stories themselves coming to life? Come to cocos a boy, leave cocos a man."

244,Coco's Outback, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Big place to dance that can easily fit over a hundred people. For this size the beer should've been cheaper.
