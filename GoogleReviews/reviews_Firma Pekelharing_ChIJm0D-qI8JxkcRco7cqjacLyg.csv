0,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,An absolutely top restaurant with special and fantastic dishes.  Lovely vibe and very good and friendly staff.  The place to go in Amsterdam.
1,Firma Pekelharing, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place to try everything, order all the dishes and all the wine and enjoy."
2,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favourite restaurant in the neighborhood at the moment. Delicious food and friendly staff. I ordered a glass of wine which I didn't like very much though I finished it nearly, told the waiter I want another glass but other wine because I …"
3,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Simply delicious food. Very friendly - and sightly cheeky - staff.

4,Firma Pekelharing, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and very good service. The waiters were always available and explained the whole menu. We got two pasta dishes. From those two, only the lasagne did not meet my expectations, as I found the sauce very heavy and overcooked. The second dish was very tasty. Also, their Pinot grigio wine was tasty."
5,Firma Pekelharing, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Big restaurant, with an Italian menu. The staff is very friendly and I enjoyed me gnocchi and creme brûlée a lot. Downside is maybe the very loud noise because of the size and setup. But nice for a groep of 2-6 people"

8,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I went there quite randomly, just because the terrace was in the sun and I was hungry (ahah) and I ended up EXTREMELY satisfied ! The pastas were really amazing, and the staff very nice and helpful. I will definitely come back :)"
9,Firma Pekelharing, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I ordered a four course meal. They brought the first course for me and then forgot to bring the rest, we waited 30 minutes and nobody even checked on us or asked us if we were ok, I had to get up and ask a waitress to bring the rest, no …"
10,Firma Pekelharing, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,Extremely rude service. Told us completely out of the blue that our table was reserved and we had to leave.

16,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty and high quality Italian food! Dishes are on the pricey side, but it's quite clear that this is because they are cooked with quality ingredients. The saffron arancini were great (though different from Sicilian ones), so was the …"
17,Firma Pekelharing, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Was really looking forward to this. The Food was ok, but apparently since we were a large group (6?...even if we originally did book 10, but gave them more than hours warning to change to 6), we were only offered a set menu with a three …"

Whether you’re a meat-lover or a vegetarian, their menu offers up many delightful dishes to try. My one complaint is the beer selection, though their wines are always quite nice!"
21,Firma Pekelharing, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Location nice but Saturday very busy and loud. But we liked the atmosphere. Food was delicious overall. Price wise upper limit. Pasta really worth the visit. Two major critic points: service was very slow and not professional in a way that …
22,Firma Pekelharing, 2 stars ,a year ago,The Baccalà and marinated fennel were good but served with only two crostinis not really enough for two people. Lovely vitello and overall presentation of all dishes. Polenta was extremely oily but had good flavour. Courgette flowers were a …
23,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Oysters and cava with best terrace view for watching the hustle and bustle of the Van Woustraat, an excellent 4-course menu changing every week if you don’t want to choose from the a la carte menu, as you have eaten it all yet as coming back very often.."

25,Firma Pekelharing, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"This place has delicious Italian food on its menu. Don't think standard pastas or pizzas though. Absolutely loved the ravioli and gnocchi. Combined with some great red wine, a good atmosphere and nice service, I can truly recommend it."
26,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I walked in without a reservation on a Monday night, without a reservation, and felt warmly welcomed and treated well (as a single diner!). I had a SHOCKINGLY enjoyable meal of fish soup and Jerusalem Artichoke  ravioli. The service was just fine, the food great, and the atmosphere warm and relaxing. I loved this place."
27,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great neighbourhood restaurant. Come with a date, a group or alone and share the big communal table or sit at the bar. Whilst living here my favourite thing to do on a Sunday was walk up to the pijp, take in some shops and then come here …"
28,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food, nice atmosphere between brasserie and Bruin cafe. Good service and a lively ambience. There is a sucking pig on the menue that you have to order 4 days in advance for a big group. Definitely going to try that next time."
29,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Charming waiter! We had a 4 course menu and each dish was incredible, in particular the croquettes and chicken. Very comfortable surroundings and atmosphere, would highly recommend!"

31,Firma Pekelharing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent Italian food, compliments for the original menu. Good atmosphere and 'service with a smile'. During peak hours a bit crowded, tables should be just a little less close to each other."
32,Firma Pekelharing, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food is super greasy, very oily and salads or pastas are mixing up totally irrelevant ingredients. Personnel is quite pretentious, and the menu is expensive for what it is. It’s not a Mediterranean place, it’s some kind of Dutch restaurant …"
33,Firma Pekelharing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Expensive but a cozy (gezellig) setting. I paid €48 for three starters (shared between between 8) a main and some wine. Which is a lot really. But you’re paying for the location too, De Pijp is after all, the trendy area of Amsterdam. Not …"

36,Firma Pekelharing, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"The food is fine and the ambiance very nice, but I had a similar experience to other reviewers that the service is shocking, to the point that it destroys the pleasure of the evening.  Our waitress was so incredibly rude throughout out meal we will never ever be back.  What a shame."
37,Firma Pekelharing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have been here 4 times over 7 years and every time the standards are high, food is great, staff are uber helpful, beer is good, and it's medium priced.. it's cool.. if you are near and wondering if it's good..it is"
