0,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"It‚Äôs a very cool place, especially in the summer when you can sit outside and enjoy the view, the pizzas are quite good large and with a different doe than the usual Italian pizza. I‚Äôd definitely suggest if you are in the area to go and eat here."
1,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I had the vegetarian pizza and it was nice(not awesome but nice). The best thing about the place is that it has both a nice view(facing Amstel river) and nice food! The staff were really kind tooüëçKeep in mind that the pizza portions are quite big before ordering one per person.
2,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Amazing pizzas and pastas! I can personally recommend Pizza B√≤ (Calzone)
The terrace is also just amazing and the service is very friendly and super quick!"
3,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,a month ago,Pizza came in cold but after a few minutes in the oven the taste was great. Tiramisu is like a taste explosion. üëç
4,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Delicious pizza and especially the pasta alla carbonara. The portions are very big!
Staff is friendly, especially Ilaria. ‚Ä¶"
5,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"When they say the pizza is big, here it's huge!
Size apart, the staff is nice, could be a bit faster in the orders, so you don't get your drink after you finish your meal. ‚Ä¶"
6,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Very good quality and prices are ok üòä also location is wonderful close to Spaklerweg metro station and many green areas to sit around! Besides that is stunning to see the sunset from there.
7,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Very good food nice place,service is little slow."
8,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,6 months ago,A good place with plenty of seating inside and outside. Once seated you have excellent views to Amsterdam over the water. The place has a wide choice of giant pizza's and pasta's.
9,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Food was good and they were so kind.
10,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great little italian delight with big portions of Pizzas....lovely setting..with wide play area and riverfront to boot...place to dine n watch the sunset...
11,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,a week ago,"Large portion, tasty pizza, nice location"
12,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,a year ago,"You can eat delicious pizza while sitting in a nice restaurant next to Amstel river. Portions are quite big, but you get a box in case you won't finish it. Friendly staff. Went there for dinner, there were available tables only inside, but they thought of us in the moment they had a free table outside. Nice place to visit."
13,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow, big delicious pizza. Surprisingly good for 2 persons. Price is worth the "" buono "" Italian food served. Gracious servers. Speak English  too. Good location infront Amstel river. Relaxing ! Recommendable !"
14,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,a month ago,Very good food but service was very long and they forgot a couple times our order. I suppose the night for Valentine's day was also very hectic but a bit or a shame.
15,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing experience! The food is great and the staff super friendly. The pizza‚Äôs are huge and delicious. Please try the chocolate souffl√©, you won‚Äôt be disappointed! ‚Ä¶"

17,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"The pizza's are gigantic and very tasty. Drinks are okay, the service is good and the wait seems average 30-45min for a meal. Having good company is recommended. ‚úåÔ∏èThe ambiance is okay."
18,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Restaurant! Outstanding service and the best pizza I have ever eaten in the Netherlands. Thin, crispy crust, and delicious toppings. They are good to share, as they are about 30 inches in diameter. The pasta is also delicious! Nice sauce and great quality parmesan cheese on top. Lovely atmosphere. Would love to go again soon!"
19,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good restaurant with excellent pizza. The staff is very friendly and helpful. However sometimes they are a bit under staffed and should definitely get more people working in busy nights. Besides that I would highly ret eating here!!!
20,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Best pizza I have had in ages, pasta looked good, mahooooosive portions. Tip, get there early to enjoy a walk along the river."
21,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food and we had a very friendly waiter. Great interior/atmosphere :)
The pizza is huge by the way!"
22,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,a month ago,Love love L‚ÄôOsteria Amsterdam since the opening. After ordering during the lock down it was such a pleasure to visit them again. üòä
23,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Pizza was very large and delicious. The waitress (Ilaria) was super nice providing recommendations on the pizzas and wines.
24,L'Osteria, 2 stars ,2 weeks ago,Very disappointed. Arrived to be told the terrace is closed so sat inside to just watch people from the terrace being served. After 10min of no service I asked if we could order just to be told I need to stand in line for the bar/terrace‚Ä¶. Absolute joke and has nothing to do with any of the other restaurants with the same name‚Ä¶
25,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"A very Dutch ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù restaurant. The food was not bad at all (tortelli al prosciutto), but recipes are variations of Italian ones. Pizza looks huge."
26,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Massive pizzas, lovely staff and cold beer."
27,L'Osteria, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Lousy pizza and service.
The ingredients to top the pizza were just the cheapest canned choice one can buy. The waiters actually complained to us about the tip left by the customers ‚Ä¶"
28,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"True Pizzeria Atmosphere. The food was delicious, great Bufala pizza. The experience was the same as in a good pizzeria in Italy, relaxed and enjoyable. The staff was helpful and present. Lovely limoncello. I will be back for sure"
29,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice Italian place. I really love the location (especially in summer) since it is by the water. Pizza's are huuuuge and very tasty.

34,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very decent food options for a very good price. Service was quite slow, took long before food came or before we could re-order beers. P.S. the pizzas are massive."
35,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"+ Very big size Pizzas
+ Good price Vs portion.
+ Friendly staffs. ‚Ä¶"
36,L'Osteria, 1 star ,6 months ago,I ordered Risotto Funghi and i was very disappointed. I managed to eat half of it and it took me half an hour but only because I was starving. It had a good taste(the sauce) but rice was terrible. It tasted like eating non cooked pasta ‚Ä¶
37,L'Osteria, 2 stars ,a year ago,60 Minutes to wait at outside take away corner. Especially because during order they announced only 20 minutes to wait. Our neighbours had to wait even longer. There pizza order got lost at the pizza order stand and then they got a cold one.
38,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,a year ago,"L‚ÄôOsteria is marked as one of my favorites on Google Maps but today wasn‚Äôt a great experience. The service was very slow, we had to ask and signal for a waiter every time. At first we thought maybe they were understaffed but at some point, ‚Ä¶"
39,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"One of the few places with actually great italian food, along with the view and the interior design of the place. went there twice, great on a sunny days and also child friendly."
40,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit out of the way but great food and a nice atmosphere. Next to a small lake which makes for a good evening dinner backdrop.
Close to metrostation Sparklerweg so it's easy enough to get to."
41,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Nice food and a nice location, but service could be more professional"
42,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Nice location. Pizzas are huge. I was jealous that my friend got one and I got pasta üòÖ
43,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, huge portions at a very nice and cozy location"
44,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The pizza was GIGANTIC and really really good. It was super satisfying to dig into such a big pizza. Did have to wait a bit before being seated but that was alright.
45,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, beautiful location. Pizzas are huge so one is definitely enough for 2 adults!"
46,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Pizza 4 stars. Attitude 2 stars. People buying take aways and sitting in the restaurant are almost like two different castes... üôÑ Even though what they pay is identical
47,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Friendly, great service. Super fast in the kitchen. We barely waited 5 minutes for a delicious pizza."
48,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Huge delicious pizza's & pasta's and quick service!
49,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Wonderful (and huge) pizzas! Wonderful and friendly staff. Top location, with terrace, playground and view. Nice interior."
50,L'Osteria, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Unfortunately the meal was a disaster. Lasagna was dry, no sauce or bechamel and the middle was cold probably from rehitting from frozen. PAsta was raw (no, it was not al dente but raw).
Would come back only for drinks."
51,L'Osteria, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Edit: Again on a regular weekend... Nobody seemed to be responsible for the tables outside. Staff how showed up were not responsible for taking orders and after waiting a long time and having a super tired kid with us, we kindly asked to ‚Ä¶"
52,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Food was great, people were awesome! They sang me happy birthday along with a lit tiramisu. :) terrace was lovely to sit at."

Don't go for lasagna and the personnel is quite disoriented sometimes"
54,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice Italian restaurant with good prices and service.

Food was good and service nice."
55,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Love this place - the pizza's are amazing (especially in size) and the atmosphere is usually also really good. Especially during summer when the terrace is open. For 5-stars the service can improve; they forget things, are too busy and do not take extra time. However overall, one of my favs!"
56,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great service, Amazing food, pizza's are Huge.....what I love the most is that they have several Gluten Free dishes üòÉüëèüëè"
57,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy place near the water with an amazing view over the river amstel. The people there are friendly and helpful. The food is tasty and priced reasonably. The doses are massive, you can easily share a pizza between two. If you don't finish ‚Ä¶"
58,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, good atmosphere, great service, the food is good and variety of drinks"
59,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was strange to an American because the pizza was served as a whole without slides, and eat with knife and fork. The waitress was nice enough to slide them for us when we asked but probably thought we were weird or entitled people who ‚Ä¶"
60,L'Osteria, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Long waiting time. We waited 45 min for our pizzas.
But the food was ok"
61,L'Osteria, 1 star ,a year ago,I have been billed twice when I ordered pizza there online. I called them and they said to send an email and guess what I did not hear for weeks when I sent an email to the address in the website. I called them again and they said that ‚Ä¶
62,L'Osteria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We had two different pizzas and were quite dry in my opinion, the size it's huge but disappointing taste. The Spritz also wasn't done with the right ingredients so wasn't a regular one, we ordered Tiramisu and also wasn't great so food wise ‚Ä¶"
63,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We called before and reserved, when arrive it was very busy and took time to get to table because big line and man at the door had so many persons coming to him and alone. Once we got to table serving was slow but 1 waitress was doing a lot ‚Ä¶"
64,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Super big pizza's and good quality for the price!! Been here more than 10 times since I live across the street. Staff could be a bit quicker sometimes but since they have super rush hours I can understand it will slow down sometimes. In general a very nice dinner for a good price with lovely sunsets!!!
65,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This lovely place is located in a nice area at the river with some options to sit outside. There's a good selection of food and drinks at reasonable prices. The pizza's are huge with a very thin dough. I tried the one with italian sausage ‚Ä¶
66,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The Pizzas were just too good to be true. The Ambience is very pleasant. Loved it.
67,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best pizza in the area. Even God approves

71,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We had a very sweet and friendly waitress! Ordered a starter (pizza panne i believe) which was too big for one person. Luckily we shared it. Then had some pasta which was the best pasta I had so far! At the end we wanted to pay but all the ‚Ä¶
72,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place with tons of outdoor seating g and nice play area for kids. It maybe seemed like they were understaffed during our dinner time. It took a very long time to get our food and one of our appetizers we had to ask about. Overall a ‚Ä¶
73,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, service and staff. Very kind, polite and helpful catering to all our needs. Price of the food is also payable for what you get. Ive never had such a big pizza or calzone."
74,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful pizzas on a beautiful spot near the Amstel. Especially the simple pizzas (Margherita is the queen) are quite good. Big, thin bottom and thick crust. The environment is very energetic and the waiters and waitresses are quite friendly. Never tried the other food then pizza, but it also looks good."
75,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,a year ago,Favorite place to grab lunch with friends. Beautiful along the waters and tasty good with big portions at s fair price. Our Italian colleagues gave their stamp on the quality as well!
76,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"First of all my compliments that the staff actually knows the food and has their own personal favourites. This might sound a bit strange, but it's nice when you ask a waiter for a recommendation and they actually can describe why they like ‚Ä¶"
77,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Pizza was delicious. Unfortunately service was really  bad and slow. Also beware of wasps!
78,L'Osteria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was alright, but I‚Äôve had better. The pasta was somewhat bland. The Moscow mules are not recommendable. You get glass with some vodka, ice and limes, and a ginger ale (nope not ginger beer) on the side to ‚Äúmix‚Äù the cocktail ‚Ä¶"
79,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We were staying in a nearby hotel for 6 nights and ate here on three of those! Really friendly team, great food, and by Amsterdam standards, great value for money. The setting is amazing too, right on the waterfront. Gets very busy in the ‚Ä¶"

88,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It's not that expensive and the food is good. The pizzas are quite big. But you can share one or get two flavors (two halfs) on one pizza. Lovely helpful waitresses is always a plus one of course.
89,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I ordered a pizza ruccola and it was truly the best pizza i have had in holland.I live here for 3 years and never had a real pizza except from L‚Äôosteria!!

92,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The genuine Italian experience that begins with the exotic welcome greeting in proper Italian accent at the door. Great coffee,  pizza and more. If you're walking by, need a rest, drink or food don't doubt and just drop in!"
93,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I was not expecting such massive pizzas. The pizza is thin, but the diamater its really big. If you are not very hungry, one pizza can serve two. Was gladly surprised about the prices, not expensive at all despite being located in a fancy ‚Ä¶"

96,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely delicious food, great fresh pizza, friendly service. Only downfall is we had to wait a long time for our table, then service was slow as it was busy. Worth the wait though."
97,L'Osteria, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I can relate to the recent reviews. Hardly any personnel to help you. We sat there on Wednesday with three people for 20 minutes (the sun was out, so it wasn‚Äôt that bad to wait) and no one served us. The one waitress outside was only ‚Ä¶"
98,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Generally great quality of ingredients and confident food. Location is beautiful at the water and the view of Amsterdam. One downside is the popularity and the size of the building. It is very crowded and loud, staff are not able to keep up. Would be 5 stars if they'd either hire more staff or reduce the density of tables."
99,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best pizza in Amsterdam so far! üçïüçïüçï And what a beautiful view of the Amstel.

102,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing pizza. Nice place
103,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizza at its best. This German Born Italian style restaurant run by Dutch experts is a good mixture of everything you need for Pizza. It looks like global food. Nice location, good products, service very friendly, it may take some time to serve you though."
104,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place. The personnel is very nice and friendly. Nice atmosphere and food. There's still space for improvement, therefore 4 stars.
I wish there were more out-of-the-box vegan options in the menu, it would make it really cool and appealing to the new generation of people who give a damn."
105,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,a year ago,Really nice restaurant with BIG pizza's. Good service. Real Italian food. Fair price. Looking over the water towards the old city center of Amsterdam.

108,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really cosy place with great food!

110,L'Osteria, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Service is still bad and the pizza's were almost cold when served. Drinks did not arrive. We had to ask for the drinks when the food was already on the table.

113,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good pizza nice crusty crust. I won't recommend extra's, they do not really meet  the expectations. We asked for extra gorgonzola and they were only few drips, it was not worth the money."
114,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place for a bite outside. Great view of the Amstel and excellent playground for the kids. Food and drink were good but lost a star due to service. The place was not busy and we had to go inside to ask for service from the staff who were sitting at the bar. I'd give them another chance since the quality of the food was great.
115,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy place close to the river. Good Italian ingredients. The only issue is the size of the pizza compared to the plate (not easy to eat).
116,L'Osteria, 2 stars ,3 years ago,food is cheap but not really good either... staff is alright i guess. but the view is amazing !
117,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place serves huge pizzas! They have lots of options and they're all delicious! And if you can't choose than you can get two different sides on one pizza.

119,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,a year ago,Large pizzas for a great price. In terms of quality other pizzerias in town are better. Atmosphere and views are great.

121,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice place with big and delicious pizza
122,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The service on the terrace is not too good. Long waiting times, orders that go wrong etc. But it is an ideal place to be with kids on a sunny day. One can have a nice drink or pizza whilst watching the kids play in the adjacent and connected playground. Just like having a garden."
123,L'Osteria, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good and cheap pizza. Pastas are nice as well. When ordering ahead they are not always ready when told. Nice terrace.
124,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome pizza, very tasty, the best I‚Äôve ever had in the Netherlands, almost Italian. They are also huge so fine to share. The tiramisu was terrible though."
125,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very tasty pizza. Terras was full (reservation required on sunny days). But we took our food away (they do take away) and ate it in the park next to the water just in front of the restaurant. Will certainly do that again soon !
126,L'Osteria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A fantastic, atmoshere-generating, young and live restaurant on the Amstel, some 7 km from Amsterdam downtown. The restaurant is managed by Dutch people, but you immediately recognise the presence of an Italian chef. The pizzas are tasty ‚Ä¶"
127,L'Osteria, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Reasonable Italian food for a reasonable price. Wonderful location near the bank of the Amstel. Staff is very friendly and helpful but on a sunny afternoon there are just too few of them so ordering took ages and it took ages for drinks and ‚Ä¶

133,L'Osteria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is good, but the service we experienced that evening was not good in any way. We waited 1,5 hour for our order, because they had forgotten about it and when the food arrived they had gotten one of the orders wrong. The food was very good, but you have to have patience."
