1,Siriphon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I have been in Thailand and tasted the real Thaï food and I can clearly say that this place serves authentic Thai food !

7,Siriphon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Coming to this friendly place for +15 years. It’s great, just as the cook and it’s host. Highly recommended. Try the chicken cashew or green curry with garter."
8,Siriphon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cute restaurant with delightful staff. The menu is long, decently varied and the food is very tasty. The beer wasn't very cold when we went, but this is a minor quibble."

12,Siriphon, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Every week since lockdown we get takeout. The two women running Siriphon are tireless and cheerful, despite their struggle to stay afloat in this time. And the food remains really tasty and affordable, as always."
13,Siriphon, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Value for money. In middle of city.
Host was good and friendly. Food presentation was good. Taste can improve more."
14,Siriphon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The best Thai  food in Amsterdam. The real taste of Thailand they have Singa and Chang beer.
15,Siriphon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Been there with a group of friends. The place is small and quite crowded with tables so can get noisy but overall it is a nice restaurant. The service is fast and stuff very welcoming. Food was good, I haven't been to many Thai restaurants …"
16,Siriphon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice Thai restaurant. Mix starter was a good starter and enough for 2 people. Fried rice was nice. Fried chicken with mushroom and oyster sause and red chicken curry with coconut milk was really good. Green curry chicken was nice but it has strong anise taste if you don't like it. It is good to book in advance by calling them.
17,Siriphon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Dishes taste great, if only a little on the small side. Try the cashew chicken. Their fried rice is also very nice. You don't usually have to wait, but sometimes they'll close early if it's a slow night, so don't go too late."

21,Siriphon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place and nice people. Unfortunately the food was pretty bland. Not that it wasn't spicy enough, but it just lacked excitement. Given the many five-star reviews it received, I guess the chef had an off-day ?"
22,Siriphon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Okay Thai restaurant. Ordered Phad Thai, Fish Curry Tom Yam, Fried Rice for 4 people and Thai Ice Tea. Taste other than the fried rice is good. The fried rice is a bit bland. The service is very fast and friendly although the portion a bit small but reasonable for the price."
23,Siriphon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Super oily dishes, the fish dishes had soggy tampura that made it impossible to eat. We ordered wine and soda water, when we asked for tap water afterwards, they said they don't do tap water...Lastly they were super sketchy with the bill …"
24,Siriphon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food here was very good -- but the restaurant's approach to water was bizarre, to say the least. We asked for tap water, which they brought reluctantly. Then one woman said the water they gave us was actually for another table and tried …"
25,Siriphon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The best and most authentic Thai we've found in Amsterdam. Friendly and welcoming service. Recommend both the Pad Thai and the sweet and spicy cashew chicken.
26,Siriphon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent service, doesnt get any better than this. Not ""westernized"" but real authentic Thai food. Asked for extra spice and it burned my mouth just as when I was in Thailand. Great!"
27,Siriphon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food. But some things can be spicy. I recommend it if you are near. The owner is really friendly. It is a great prize for the quality of food.
28,Siriphon, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"A bit hidden on a side street practically a stone-through away from the Heineken Square (Heinekenplein), this lovely resto has excellent food, a cozy atmosphere, moderate prices, and a friendly service given by the owner and her family.  Recommended!"
