0,Michel-Inn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A real italian pizza, with a Grest dough and delicious topping. Good service and prices in the average for Amsterdam. For me it's also positive that they have local craft beers on tap."
1,Michel-Inn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to eat and have a good time. Very good Pizza and the Foccacia is tasty. Tiramisu is also delicious.
2,Michel-Inn, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent grub. Had pizza the first night. Bruschetta and Spare Ribs the second night. Our Airbnb was perfectly located directly across the street. Solid beer selection. Went with a Butcher's Tears.
3,Michel-Inn, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food, perfect pizza. Selection of beers is nice as well. Try the Brothers in Law. And the place is run by people passionate for what they do, which really adds to the overall experience."
4,Michel-Inn, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy neighborhood restaurant in Amsterdam-Oost. Friendly staff, not very big, so you sit very close to your neighbors. Just hope for them not to be loud. The food was very nice, a mix between Spanish tapas and Italian pizzas. Beware: the pizzas are huge! This is a good thing as they taste delicious."
5,Michel-Inn, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The owners are AMAZING, and the pizza is somehow even better (some of the best I've had ever including in Italy). I wish I could give it ten stars. Fair warning: if you have a dog allergy, you may want to go early in the evening because sometime's the chef's dog visits near closing time."
6,Michel-Inn, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Trattoria Pizzeria with Italian staff is a rarity. Place is cozy and good for families. Food is sub Italian standard; pizza bottom is too thin and soft, edges burnt. Calamares not fresh and dough too thick and salty. Although we asked for ‚Ä¶"
7,Michel-Inn, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice ambience. The meals are very flavorful, for my taste a bit too salty partially. Because of the small staff, you may have to wait for a bit. The pizza is very good."
8,Michel-Inn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The staff is incredibly nice! I had a great time at this place. We had the BBQ outside and the meat was delicious. I would definitely come back next time I am in Amsterdam.
9,Michel-Inn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome pizza! This is my go to place for a proper Italian pizza around Amsterdam east. The diavolo is a must for anyone who can handle flavor  üòÅ nice people, awesome food!"
10,Michel-Inn, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Ambiance is nice, staff is friendly. We had pizza so I can't say anything about the tapas, so maybe they're the secret to success of this place. Unfortunately the pizza is not: bland, over cooked, the dough is not properly leavened, definitely not worth the money. Sorry"
