0,La Piazza, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We came for a quick dinner, but La Piazza is surely also suitable for fine dining! Unfortunately we had to leave early because of the restrictions (they were very strict with the rules). Nonetheless overall a fantastic restaurant!"
1,La Piazza, 5 stars ,a month ago,"After a long day it was finally time to wind down and enjoy an Italian dinner. From outside it looks a bit old, but the interior inside is beautiful! The vegetarian lasagna was perfect (just a little bit much for me) and the service was spot on."
2,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"The restaurant was full, but nonetheless we were able to sit within minutes after a waiter (I think his name is Mart) got an extra table and chairs. The atmosphere was great, the service was excellent and the food fantastic. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam."
3,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Celebrated my birthday at La Piazza and it didn’t disappoint! We came with a big group and were seated upstairs. Not only did we have a private area, the food was excellent and so was the service!"
4,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Overall, I had a great experience the restaurant, but what I’ve enjoyed the most is the special taste of the pizza I had. The toppings were nothing out of the ordinary, but the mozzarella cheese is possibly the best one I’ve ever tasted!"
5,La Piazza, 5 stars ,a month ago,Went for a pizza pesto and a glass of the red house wine. Besides the garlic on the pizza (I prefer without but I forgot ask) everything was great! Also the staff was of great help (they helped me with some directions to some sites). Thanks a lot!

13,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Nice, fairly priced cocktails and a classic Italian pizza quattro formaggio.

21,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"I was reluctant to go as I’m a difficult eater, but the employees were very flexible when it came to dish modifications and very clear about what’s inside every dish! Another big plus is the huge servings of the glasses of wine!"
22,La Piazza, 5 stars ,a month ago,"The food was delicious and the service was wonderful, but what I liked the most is the old photos on the wall of the restaurant and its employees. La Piazza is more than just a restaurant!"

25,La Piazza, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Superb food, well located to Dam Square, reasonable ptices, good service. My only criticism is that as we weren't that hungry we ordered 1 anti pasta and 1 pizza and stated it was to share and the anti pasta arrived a few minutes after the …"

37,La Piazza, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Very bad organization with waiters. We have order two meals(wait for 15min and second meal was served 10min after the first one) and for 14 euro pasta ""carbonara"" is everything but not real italian meal."

61,La Piazza, 1 star ,4 months ago,Very bad service and food for expensive prices. SCAM!
62,La Piazza, 1 star ,a year ago,"Even though the waitress is nice, the waiter keeps buzzing around waiting for the clients to finish their dish so he can jump in and clear the plates. Thats extremely disrespectful and opressing.
Also, the mozzarella tastes like plastic"
63,La Piazza, 5 stars ,a month ago,Excellent price in the heart of Amsterdam - Dam square
64,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great pizza !!!!
65,La Piazza, 1 star ,a year ago,We came here for a quick meal in July 2019 and the service was not good. They were very rude when we were sitting outside and our food came very late and our order was partially wrong. The pizza was very greasy as well. Would not go back
66,La Piazza, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was semi decent.  The absurd part was the service, while taking our order, the server walked away 3 times and was very rude.  The server even wrote down the numbers of the dishes we wanted but even then my wife was given a …"
67,La Piazza, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Verry good pizza nice staff
68,La Piazza, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Only 1 pizza for three people? No, you leave. Please leave.

69,La Piazza, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was damn good for the prize! Ordered a pizza for myself and a carbonara for my friend and it came in good time. For a food joint near the centre of Amsterdam the price is really good! Highly recommend! Great staff too.
70,La Piazza, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Not great staff.. Kinda felt they were bugged to serve us, since i wasn't feeling that well and didn't want to order anything just for myself. My wife and I shared a pizza and she had a glass of wine. Food was good (not great though) and I constantly felt/saw that staff were bothered that we occupied a space there for a small order."
71,La Piazza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"First of all the workers are really nice!!! Not very expensive for the area and great atmosphere!
Looks very Italian, which makes you feel like you’re in Italy! …"
72,La Piazza, 1 star ,3 years ago,"BAD EXPERIENCE
It’s the perfect TOURISTS TRAP !
A talkative waiter hosts us, he comes directly to take orders, we feel directly …"
73,La Piazza, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We ordered pizza which was nice. After the first bite, we saw a mouse. An actual mouse in the kitchen and the waiter did not do anything but shush us. This is the first time I've walked out of a restaurant without paying. Would avoid at all costs"
74,La Piazza, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Sent upstairs on our own even though there were tables free downstairs, waiter was a busy body but did not greet us, pizza was surprisingly okay but the waiter farted mid meal AND we saw a bloody MOUSE!!! just jamming about! Avoid 🙁"
75,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Carbonara and pizza were out of this world! We received great service.  And they had a Barolo for $55 that was just hitting its peak. (I've never had  a Barolo under $90)  highly recommend!
76,La Piazza, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Outrageously rude servers/owners who openly criticize your ordering and pretty awful pizza. Can’t eat an entire 12 inch pizza yourself? Don’t bother walking in. They will force you to leave. Don’t bother walking into this place. And if you don’t want dessert, that’s a problem for them too."
77,La Piazza, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This used to be a very good restaurant but the quality of the food nowadays is very bad, the radio only gave us noise and when we came in we couldn't sit downstairs where it's still pretty comfy but I was pulled by my arm and demanded to go …"
78,La Piazza, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst place I have eaten whilst in Amsterdam. The starter was clearly defrosted and in some places still frozen, the main course, pasta, tasted horrible.
My girlfriend has had better Asda price pizza. …"
79,La Piazza, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is very good, and the portions are decent. The staff are almost completely unattentive. They will take your order, bring your food to you, and that will be all until they bring your check."
80,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Right beside the palace on dam Square. Perfect place for people watching and the food was amazing.
81,La Piazza, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious authentic Italian food expertly prepared in a quaint setting right next to Dam Square.  Convenient location and good service.  Definitely worth a try when in the mood for pizza or Italian dishes.
82,La Piazza, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Mediocrity at its finest.  Don’t be fooled by the menu.  They only serve pizza, and it’s like a Tony’s pizza—not even as good as DiGiornio. Insalata mista was a bowl of iceberg lettuce and a couple of mealy tomato wedges instead of the arugula and parmesan I was expecting.  Keep walking and look for something better."
83,La Piazza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Proper Italian food cooked by real italians, molto bravo 👏!!"
84,La Piazza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We were hungry and ended up here. Nothing much going for it – average food for average prices. Typical place that opens for tourists and doesn't try particularly hard to make its food tasty.
85,La Piazza, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice ambience and an euphoric waiter,
combined with tasty food was very nice. Just the Toilets were a bit strange... hm - overall perfect for a tasty Lunch or dinner in Amsterdam!"
86,La Piazza, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is the best place in this area.
The food is great, the prices are very good and most important - the staff that works there are very nice and give a very good service.
Go and eat pizza or pasta, you will not regret it !"
87,La Piazza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I ate a pizza here few days ago and if you are looking for a traditional Italian one, this is definitely the wrong place.
The staff is not really friendly, and on the pizza they put the garlic oil....definitely overprice for the quality!"
88,La Piazza, 1 star ,3 years ago,Awful service and watered-down sauce. Would never recommend. We ordered one more beer for a joiner and 20 minutes after finishing said beer no one had checked on us.
89,La Piazza, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We ordered napoletan pizza and cream spaghetti. When we bite the pizza, it is like drinking the north sea (it means fuxxing salty). However when we ate the spaghetti, it   was not a cream pasta But milk pasta. I think the chef pour the all salt in the pizzza. It was the worst restaurant in the amsterdam."
90,La Piazza, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"The prices are way to high, and the food is not good.  The service is not bad and the waiters are nice, but they tend to leave the door open even on a cold rainy autumn day. So if you are felling cold and are looking for a good place to heat up and get a proper meal, then this place is certainly not right."
91,La Piazza, 1 star ,3 years ago,I ate a pizza here tonight. The tomato sauce was pretty salty and without oregano. The cheese quality was pretty bad too. Wouldn’t recommend this pizzeria even to my enemy.
92,La Piazza, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pleasant enough food, unpretentious surroundings and reasonable value for Amsterdam.  Showed up as a twosome on a busy evening around 1700, but they managed to find us a table anyway.  An easy choice if you're in Dam Square."
93,La Piazza, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The first impressions were very nice. Quiet cosy place to eat some pizza. The menu was structured but it was too overpriced for the quality that we got.
94,La Piazza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved the atmosphere, very authentic! I feel like I managed to find a no-hipster place in town! Waiters also very kind! Keep it up guys!"
95,La Piazza, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Overpriced. Paid 4,50 for the cheapest ice tea there is in holland, 3,00 for “garlic Bread” 2 slices of bread with minimum of cheese and 14,00 for one of the baddest pasta carbonara."
96,La Piazza, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice place, nice and kind staff, great pizzas, but small portions and very overpriced! 4,50 € for a medium coke it is just outrageous! Recommended for a quick bite."
97,La Piazza, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Decent pizza and staff. Only at the first floor the Italian ambiance was missing because of the club/house music being played.
98,La Piazza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Pizza was good but got charged €9 for two medium cokes ive never had a drink that overpriced I guess I should've brought a water bottle or something
99,La Piazza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute place that’s been here for 20+ years. We go here every time we’re in the city. Try the pizzas and the meat lasagna!
100,La Piazza, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Every year when i visit Amsterdam I come to this place. They have the best pizza's. Also the staffis very friendly and speak various languages which is helpful.
101,La Piazza, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Please try pesto pizza 🍕❤️
102,La Piazza, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The pizza was ok, not special, but they sure haven't heard of the word hospitality, and the prices for the drinks are absurd, real robbery, would not go back there"
103,La Piazza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely dishes 😋  especially the pizza

104,La Piazza, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Average pizza with above average prices. Very very thin base. Made with cheap ingredients.
105,La Piazza, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good location in Dam square seems to be a nice place to visit when it's not as busy because staff couldn't keep up with th amount of people that needed to be served. Food was very tasty and it was a good price.

109,La Piazza, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Very expensive prices, coupled with pretty sub-par food and very slow service. If I could use one word to describe this restaurant it would be price-gougey."
