10,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of two of my favourite coffeeshops in Amsterdam. Very cozy, located between the main canals, around the corner from the main tourist paths, which makes it a bit hidden. The selection is great, liberty and dr g are my personal favourites."

13,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It was okay. Not the best coffee shop I've been too. It cost 2,80 euros for a sparkling water and it took like 10 mins before we even got served what we wanted. And the place was empty. I get that we are Americans and apparently the people ‚Ä¶"

16,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 1 star ,a year ago,"Avoid if you are a tourist! Seriously the worst service I have ever seen!!! There was this guy with a mustache who seemed literally bothered by the fact that we were there. Extremely rude to us and other tourists, but seemed quite friendly with Dutch people.

21,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Weed is nothing special, was expecting more.

31,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is one of my favourite coffeeshops. Great chilled atmosphere with a great choice of smoke.

Staff friendly and worth the tip at the end. 10/10
32,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I've read other reviews that were negative, but my experience was good.  It's a small space, I didn't try any food, but it's pretty much what you'd expect.  I do have to commend them on their restroom.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Tastefully decorated and VERY clean."

41,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,For me the stuff was great..  coffee too..

43,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 3 stars ,3 years ago,One of the bud tenders doesn't speak very good english and the other one is a charming brit. I got the one with the bad english. Weed was good but definitely not great for the price. Also neither of the bud tenders really knew about weed. Only some basic old-school ways of describing some things.
44,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly staff. Cool/chill atmosphere. Flower and hash are some of the best. Good place to get a hot or cold drink while you roll and smoke. Much calmer than the other location.

49,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"An enjoyable time, I really liked the whipped cream which came separately from the hot chocolate as it was a great munchie snack. Unfortunately for me the atmosphere was wrong, the place was a bit dark which made it feel shady, and the heavy techno music really offput the chilled out vibe I was looking for"
50,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Never meet a person enjoying what they do as one servant at Barney‚Äôs Lounge. Blonde guy, very tall, and eloquent! The passion for his job was mesmerizing as were the buds shown. Cannot find the words to describe their supercalifragilisticexpialidocious MILKSHAKE!"
51,Barney's Lounge coffee shop, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The owner likes to ventilate his anger to his personel in front of the customers. Quite freaky for a chill place like a coffeeshop.
