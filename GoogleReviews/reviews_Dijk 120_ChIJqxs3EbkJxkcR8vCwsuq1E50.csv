1,Dijk 120, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had two beers during the day when it was quiet and developed an appreciation for this retro bar. The local regulars that frequent here lend it an authentic feel.

8,Dijk 120, 1 star ,2 years ago,The old lady speaks like a mad teacher. No toilet is included in your drink fee. Good to have wifi but the lady will disturb you when you are using your phone.
9,Dijk 120, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Acceptable pub, but the staff is constantly attending to their other expatriate friends. Not at all very welcoming. There are other wonderful places to go where you don't feel excluded."
