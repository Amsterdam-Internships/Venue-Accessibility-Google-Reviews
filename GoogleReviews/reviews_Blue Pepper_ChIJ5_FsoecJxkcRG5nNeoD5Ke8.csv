3,Blue Pepper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A really nice place to discover the Indonesian cuisine - variety of plates that are adopted in way (from my point of view) to European taste and are still keeping the richness and uniqueness of their cuisine: some plates impressed us by the …
4,Blue Pepper, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I am a bit torn about the ratings to give. As someone who is familiar with Indonesian cusine, I think the taste authenticity is lacking, the spices and taste is adapted for the European palate. Presentation style, was done in the number of …"

The kind waiter will lead you along the journey to discover the true contemporary indonesian taste. Relaxing atmosphere."
15,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Outstanding Indonesian food and really attentive service. We wanted a light dinner and only ordered the rendang and prawns ala carte. The chef felt our meal was incomplete without some vegetables so he included some complimentary stir fried …
16,Blue Pepper, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"If your an average Joe like myself, do not go here it is way too expensive ! Two set menus €60 and €65 we were able to get a la carte and just get a main course which was €24 per person for a small sized meal. The food was lovely and the staff was great but was well overpriced"
17,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The extremely professional staff made sure our rijsttafel included plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. The meal itself was incredibly fresh, beautifully presented, and absolutely delicious. The server and host came to …"
18,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The satay is absolutely out of this world. The rest of the food was good too and it's a nice cozy atmosphere where you can actually have a conversation.
19,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Another great tasting experience at Blue Pepper complete with wine flight. Because I couldn't eat all that was offered on the meat and fish set menu I opted for the vegan tasting menu. This was equally good and I was surprised by how much …
20,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"We came here for valentines day and opted for the taster menu.  Both of us agreed this may have been the best meal either of us have had for years.  Staff were very friendly and helpful.  My only negative point is that I'd have to come all the way to amsterdam to enjoy this meal again, otherwise we'd be regular customers!"
21,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Among the best Asian restaurants we have been to, including the best in Singapore and Hong Kong. The spicy recipes are left intact, without 'adaptation' to European tastes, which makes it an authentic Asian experience. We had 1 fish and …"
22,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There are good meals, and then there are great meals you'll remember for a long time. Our experience at Blue Pepper was one we'll remember for years to come. We ordered the chef's menu and it was all fantastic. Great ambiance, excellent service and attention to detail. Would recommend it without hesitation."
23,Blue Pepper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Stylish interior and friendly staff. 4 course tasting menu was full of surprises and kept me entertained for the whole evening. A special mention for the dessert which featured an 'electric flower' that was a never-before experience for me. …
24,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had a group dinner here to celebrate a birthday. There were a lot of vegans in the group and everybody was taken care of by the restaurant team perfectly. In fact a full vegan menu was offered to us. The place is cosy with luxe chairs …
25,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We came in for an early dinner after a long day of walking around. This was one of our favorite spots in Amsterdam! Great selection of dishes and drinks. First time trying bitterballen and it was great. SO got the combination hutspot and I got the oven dish (cauliflower, beef, cheese, mashed potatoes). We loved our experience here!"
26,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was the most interesting meal I had over five days in Amsterdam. Highly recommend if you're sick of Dutch food and want something different. Also really appreciate how they worked hard to accommodate us on a busy night with no reservations.
27,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Enjoyed a fantastic meal while vacationing in Amsterdam. Was able to try the vegetarian and meat selection menus. Enjoyed watching one of our table guests enjoy the grasshopper appetizer while I ate a chicken wonton.The palate cleanser before dessert was one of the most intriguing dishes of the evening.
28,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious Indonesian food, nice exotic cocktail and friendly service with smile. The food is the main attraction though and I guess the place is justifiably a well known local address for the best in authentic Indonesian cooking in the Dutch capital."
29,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a delightful and delicious dinner at Blue Pepper last Saturday to celebrate a milestone birthday. We highly recommend it for a wonderful rijstafel!  It was memorable in so many ways, starting with the food, which was amazing!  We all …"

34,Blue Pepper, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not bad, but I have eaten so many times so much better `rijsttafels` for much less, that we left this restaurant feeling ripped off. EUR 46.50 per person for the classic `rijsttafel` for 3 salty courses and 1 sweet course, so set dishes in …"
35,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The most interesting meal we had in a long time. Spciy food, but with unfamiliar spices. Soft-shell crab with a tangy dressing opened our eyes and ears, and wild chicken took us to another level of complex slow-cooked curry. Flawless service and food explanations throughout the evening."
36,Blue Pepper, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We had looked forward to try this out for a while, being fans of Indonesian cousine and knowing this is a modern interpretation thereof. Except from a couple of fish preparations, very good and unusual, we found basically the same classics …"
37,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I reserved a table for 2 on a rainy Monday night for my boyfriend's birthday. He had been craving a good Indonesian dinner and I wanted something special and unique for his special day. Blue Pepper did not disappoint. Even though we were …
38,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An outstanding example of an Asian kitchen. This team has both the quality of food and service right. After being asked if we wanted our food (Asian) spicy or mild, they set out to produce course after course of little wonders, bringing the …"
39,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic restaurant we discovered on a recent trip to Amsterdam. From mild to very spicy, an amazing range of dishes served in one beautiful meal. Just enjoy the experience!"
40,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Exquisite food. Our favourite Indonesian in Amsterdam. The spicy prawn curry tastes exactly like we had in Indonesia. Every bit worth the price.
41,Blue Pepper, 1 star ,4 years ago,"After reading reviews about the Blue Pepper we decided to make a reservation during our stay in Amsterdam. Upon arrival it seems unassuming and the staff were very friendly. You are given a lot of space to dine which we did quite like, but …"
42,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food and atmosphere with a pleasant combination of locals with families and some from our neighbourhood. The classic rijsttafel is a lot of food and wickedly they ask if you want more, which is actually possible. Ask for seconds of the beef curry!"
43,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best meal with pairing wines that we have had in a long time. We had the vegetarian option and the meat option, both were excellent. The ambience and camaraderie made a truly memorable evening. Thank you"
44,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wow. Discovered this place by chance. What a find. Amazing Indonesian tasting menu that included everything from grasshopper to electric blue jelly. Probably not for the unadventurous as there's no choice beyond meat menu or vegetarian menu but if you're willing to go with it you won't be disappointed.
45,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A stand out in the culinary world. Tasting menu had the best dish progression and timing of any menu I have had, each dish complimenting the last and the next, the portion size was perfect and left me happily struggling to finish the last …"
46,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Scenic and romantic dinner cruise on a luxury boat with a surprisingly high quality of fresh cooked Asian food, all cooked in front of us and lovingly presented. At some point when the boat sails on the big river it is truly thrilling. …"
47,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,6 years ago,We took the Blue Pepper dinner cruise in December. We were spending a weekend in Amsterdam and it was raining quite a lot. The choice was between sitting in our hotel room and getting soaked trying to see Amsterdam on foot. So we chose the …
48,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had a fabulous Indonesian dinner at this charming small restaurant. Packed but very personal service. Food is delicious and the surprises alone are well worth a visit. Highly recommended.
49,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We booked Blue Pepper dinner cruise for our anniversary. Just a few couples on a picture-perfect boat. Fine Asian food with a variety of tastes ending with an unusual and thrilling dessert. Serenely elegant and exclusive.
50,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I went to blue pepper for my father's birthday and they blew my expectations. Food was well though out, with carefully selected fresh ingredients. Great mixture of Indonesian flavors and modern cusine."
51,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food - a real dining experience with here and there some lovely surprises! I've been there before, but just found out they have a pre-theater dinner and so it's possible to reserve at 5:30pm and still get to the theater on time! Highly recommended!"
52,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best Indonesian in Amsterdam. We have eaten at several Amsterdam Indonesian restaurants and this is the best. Great atmosphere, attention to detail, and great flavors. Not a fast dinner, so bring someone you want to spend some time with."
53,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,a year ago,Picked up the rijsttafel for 2 this evening. It was fantastic! All my senses were awakened. So great to have this in these difficult times. Friday Date Nite was a great success!
54,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very impressive and innovative dishes! Love the fact that they divided the whole ""rijsttafel"" into multiple courses. Great service to top it all off. Absolutely worth a visit and we will go back when we are in town again."

Staff very friendly and accommodating, perfect wine recommendations."
56,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Scenic and gourmet tour of Amsterdam on their beautiful antique boat. Our group was thoroughly charmed by the exquisite food and soulful service. The early to late evening timing gave us the chance to see the city both in daylight and after dark, nicely lit up."
57,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"For people mostly used to Vietnamese and Korean cooking among the more recent Asian kitchens to come to the US, this kitchen is different and the food more curry-like and heavier. A collection of delicious, small dishes that make up the …"
58,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Recently tried. They have an outstanding creative Indonesian kitchen, you cannot compare the menu with any other Indo place in town. Chic and classy with plenty of high-end (expensive) wines, but cooking and service at a level matched by few other Asian joints in town. Reserve for the special occasion."
59,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super tasty food. Lovely hosting and great portion sizes. Some innovative  Indonesian dishes and flavours. Well priced so a real gem all-round.
60,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Top quality food and warm, friendly service. Also an extensive and well-priced wine list. Overall ambience/quality/price all in perfect balance."

65,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,9 years ago,This restaurant does not look much from the outside but my taste buds really came alive with the best Indonesian food I have ever tasted.

66,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious! Highly recommended. We did the more traditional rijsttafel and loved the variety/selection. Definitely will go back the next time I'm in Amsterdam!

A lot of good quality food .
We stayed for 3 hours! …"
68,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The best south Asian cuisine I have ever had!! The peanut sauce, the chilli and everything, just perfect!! The staff will explain every dish so that you can have the best experience."
69,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic dining on Blue Pepper's luxury boat. Atmosphere on the boat and through the Amsterdam canals at night is simoly magical. A superb 4-course meal was served with wines.
70,Blue Pepper, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"North Americans best call ahead, be posh, or avoid. We walked in, were ignored, and when we asked about a table, the response was scoffing. I'm sure the food is nice but I doubt it's good enough to make up for that approach to service"
71,Blue Pepper, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I have eaten in Indonesia (Java, Bali, Flores, Lomboq etc) and many Toko's in the Netherlands, but this experience is completely different and also the taste is not genuine. I will not say it is bad food, but the amount your spending can be 50% less for REAL Indonesian food."
72,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very special and romantic dinner cruise. The combination of great food, wines and night-time sailing experience of Amsterdam is truly unique."
73,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We found this small restaurant after reading the reviews on Der Feinschmecker. Amazing food in a beautifully designed place. Don't forget to ask for the 'special' exotic items on the menu!
74,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Small and very welcoming restaurant with unusually high standard of cooking. Nice wine list and Indonesian beers.
75,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wow what exciting and fancy food. We walked in but they gave us a very nice sofa table. You can spend hours eating unusual things here!
76,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fascinating small restaurant with top quality Asian food. Great introduction to rice table at an attractive price. Totally enjoyed.
77,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Novel experience with Indonesian food and wine. We didn't know a nice German Riesling went so well with the spicy flavours.
78,Blue Pepper, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very cosy, relaxed restaurant with great service. Every dish of the tasting menu was beautifully presented and delicious. A modern take on Indonesian food. Will be back."
79,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Been in NL for three months. This is one of the best spots I've had the pleasure of eating at here in Amsterdam. Presentation is excellent and the food passes with flying colors.

82,Blue Pepper, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Average Indonesian food. We got the ""tradition"" tasting menu and it was below my expectations. I didn't think the food was that authentic and portions were small."
83,Blue Pepper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Decent food for the price and an okay selection. No full bar - only a selection of drinks to make. Friendly staff and on top of things.
84,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Little beauty of a restaurant with museum-like art and mood lighting. Food is equally charming, sometimes spicy, and full of intense flavours."
85,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for fine dining. Good service with friendly staff. Would recommend a reservation but luckily we managed to get a table without one.
86,Blue Pepper, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Some weird and wacky interpretations but all  tasty and interesting. Excellent service but you do need deep pockets. The decor and toilets are also rather tired.

90,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Superb food and wines. We had the mini rijsttafel with 2 glasses of an Italian red and felt very satisfied.
91,Blue Pepper, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was actually pretty good overall but many of the dishes were way too exotic for my tastes. There's no way I'll be willing to eat grasshoppers.
92,Blue Pepper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've come to the conclusion that fine dining and Asian (Indonesian in this case) food, for me, don't really go together. Nonetheless, great food and service."
93,Blue Pepper, 4 stars ,8 years ago,Great fusion food. The inclusion of thai and indonesian into menu was authentic enough. Great wine. Cosy abt 25 tables.
