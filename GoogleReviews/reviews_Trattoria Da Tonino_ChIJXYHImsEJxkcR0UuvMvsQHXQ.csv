0,Trattoria Da Tonino, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Great meal, but quite simple. Wasn't extraordinary but enough, price is affordable, but we had to pay 5.5€ for tap water... And also the visa cards do +1€ for the check.."
1,Trattoria Da Tonino, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Reasonable…. Definitely not the best pizza in the city as they mention on the website.
The place is really small, but sufficient enough when it’s not busy. We were the …"
2,Trattoria Da Tonino, 5 stars ,a month ago,We had a wonderful and delicious dinner here. Owner was very gentle and cheerful. He has done every request we have given with joy. Lasagna's are very good. You can customize your orders here. We will definitely visit again. Thank you  very much :) Kind Regards from Istanbul :)
3,Trattoria Da Tonino, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, and Italian music"
4,Trattoria Da Tonino, 2 stars ,6 months ago,I give two stars just for the waiter... he was a good guy... but the food and drinks are orribile... pizza it was better in a turkey restaurant or domino's..  beer didn't taste anything ... just orrible... sorry but i not recommend this restaurant.... he just a fake Italian restaurant...
5,Trattoria Da Tonino, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The food was very good.
The service is top notch.
Lastly the atmosphere in the place is very homelike."
6,Trattoria Da Tonino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great pizza's, nice and crisp crust. The toppings taste great and the cheese is just amazing. Real friendly waiter too. Pricing is avarage for pizza and quite valuable in Amsterdam."
7,Trattoria Da Tonino, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little Trattoria, but... Christmas decoration in June and plastic plants. Service and Pizza is quite okay."
8,Trattoria Da Tonino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I did not read the reviews before.... chose this place randomly. Was positively surprised. PIZZA was AWESOME... tiramisu was a disaster. Friendly service :)
9,Trattoria Da Tonino, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Awesome service, very good food"
10,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We live around the corner and thought on this past rainy Sunday, lets take away some pizza. I ve never seen two more miserable little pizza’s for 20 euro. The cheese was plastic and the meat cheap. Waste of money."
11,Trattoria Da Tonino, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Nice staff, food is not super"
12,Trattoria Da Tonino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really tasty carbonara and nice big portions for 12 euro. There was just one guy running the whole place which was impressive and his service was friendly and timely. I would definitely recommend here for a quick lunch stop and can imagine it would make a nice dinner stop also.
13,Trattoria Da Tonino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Normally I finish my pizzas but this time I only ate halve of the pizza. The pizza wasn’t like a tasty traditional Italian pizza. The beer they served was also death, it was supposed to be a normal Heineken from the tap but it tasted like …"
14,Trattoria Da Tonino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It’s a good place to eat, nothing spectacular, but good enough."
15,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Chicken soup is in fact instant soup, bruschetta were extremely small, garlic bread is a joke and it comes with margarine instead of butter, juice of any type comes by the glass and you don t see what bottle they pour it from. Apple juice …"
16,Trattoria Da Tonino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly service. Quite good food, if not superb. Perhaps a little pricey at €113 for 2 adults and two kids. This was for two small garlic bread starters, a pizza margherita, cannelloni, entrecote and scallopini, with three desserts, …"

19,Trattoria Da Tonino, 2 stars ,6 years ago,We ended up heading here as my friends fell for the discounted food offerings but sadly it turned into something of a tourist trap. The staff were nice and friendly and yes the food was very quick but I'd have to say the food was below …
20,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,4 years ago,"My friends and I went for a meal there, ordering a variety of dishes including steaks and pastas. All meals were poor quality and overpriced, with the rib eye steak being particularly lacklustre. I'd rather have starved."
21,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst Restaurant ever.

He tried to sell us juice as wine and he tried to sell us alcohol free beer as …"
22,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We waited like about an hour for 2 pizzas. Then i asked the waiter how long it is going to take and he screamed ""We are not Mcdonald's"". I was just shocked about his reaction and it was really unfriendly. I will never recomended this place to eat..."
23,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Coca Cola was not real Coca Cola, and the Heineken also was a poor quality beer. Check your drinks when order your meal. The rest of our dinner just normal, nothing special to mention."
24,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We said we were from Portugal and the manager said "" oh good, Cristiano Ronaldo is my favourite player"".... he was trying to be nice, ok. Then we ordered garlic bread. It came....not toasted....saying that this way is better.... ok, …"
25,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,5 years ago,"My girlfriend and I found this place whilst looking for somewhere to eat, so we headed inside. It's quite daunting when entering a completely empty restaurant, and can also be worrying. Why was this little Italian restaurant on the busy …"
26,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Sad place. Pathetic pizza, cola cost 4.5 euros - which he poured a big glass of where I couldn't see! (cheap euro-saver cola 2Ltr bottle of course- and when I went to pay he added an extra euro. Pity I can't put zero stars for rating."
27,Trattoria Da Tonino, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Very good food for great value! The owner is so nice!
28,Trattoria Da Tonino, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Service was great and very friendly, the food my friend and I had was delicious. I would totally recommend it to a friend visiting Amsterdam. Very nice and I didn't find the prices that outrageous- even as a budget minded backpacker."
29,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,5 years ago,What a terrible place. The samon was from a supermarket freezer and totally overcooked. The musscles dish my girlfriend ate was also frozen supermarket stuff. The wine didn't even taste like wine! We ended up paying 60 euro's for something that you buy for 7 euro's in the local supermarket. Do not eat here!
30,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,3 years ago,Awful! Waited for 45 minutes to get an awful pizza (cheap frozen one would have tasted better!) - had to go and pick up cutlery on my own. Big glass of cheap coke. DO NOT GO THERE!!!

32,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I haven't seen so antiphatic owners in my life. Misbehaved, unpolite and they make us separate our table in the middle of our meal because they didn't have enough space."
33,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,4 years ago,Forget it. Everything is terrible. Wine is like  limonade. Seafood pasta is made of surimi. I made the mistake not checking reviews before.
34,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,6 years ago,Too expensive for what you get and very rude service. The food looks and tastes as if it was bought directly from the supermarket.
35,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This should be your last option in Central Amsterdam, better go to mcdonalds. The quality of service and management was the worst I have seen in the Central Area."
36,Trattoria Da Tonino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Awufull place!!
They had a bad service and waited for a long time for just a burger!They just cheat everyone!"
