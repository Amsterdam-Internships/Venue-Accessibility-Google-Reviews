2,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Friendly staff,
nice view,
Guinness tastes as it supposed to,
Jameson, ginger & lime, too."
3,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,a month ago,"If I could put zero,  I would add zero. The worst fish and chips in the world is served here. Soggy uncooked batter, frozen fish, nightmare chips. Why would you advertise it as a special of the day? Avoid this place like the plague."
4,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved the food!!A++ I had the grilled salmon! My husband had the fish and chips!!! Twas all delicious!!
But if you ever go to this restaurant,  make sure that you are hungry!!! Because ‚Ä¶"
5,Aran Irish Pub, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to stop off for a drink or food,breakfast lunch or dinner. It's nice outside sitting next to the river watching the boats go by on a sunny day. They do charge you 50cents to use the loo even if you are a paying customer.  Food was fine and plenty of drinks to choose from. Definitely worth a visit."
6,Aran Irish Pub, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"It's only ok. Obviously designed for stag parties. Not particularly pretty inside or out. Grand if you want a load of drinks. Had breakfast here and it was cold! Service was standard. It's a busy spot, so maybe it's just me."
7,Aran Irish Pub, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Very touristy, basic sports bar. Nothing special but a nice place for a quick coffee or Guiness"
8,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great place with a nice Irish atmosphere (I‚Äôll be honest, there were so many irish people that night that it might‚Äôve helped). The staff is very nice and smiling and the beer is well priced ! Recommended"
9,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Very rude personal, awful service, we waited 20 minutes for a waiter trying to order something and nobody came to us. Trying to make an order at the bar I was sent for only table service but a few persons took beer at the bar just in front ‚Ä¶"
10,Aran Irish Pub, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"The setting is nice, the terrace is too. Unfortunately  for anything else it‚Äôs downhill from there. Slow service, understaffed, food is good if ur starving but boring at best if you‚Äôre not malnourished. Meh"
11,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,3 months ago,Rang the day before just to make sure they would be playing the Irish rugby match that would be on (you would kind of assume they would given its an IRISH pub). Said it was grand that they would be playing it. Arrived today a little late ‚Ä¶
12,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great service, amazing food, 5 star place"
13,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice Irish Pub in a good location. It has two floors so there's plenty of room. I was there when it wasn't busy at all for lunch and pretty chill. I had Irish stew, which was pretty good and my friend had trout that she enjoyed. There's a smoking room on the second floor, which is kind of unique. I'd recommend it for a casual lunch."

17,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice place to get a beer. Onion rings are the best I've ever had!!
18,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Good service upstairs. Great bar snacks also. Lots of screens for watching sport whilst staying sufficiently hydrated. Great location overlooking the canals and entrance to Vondelpark. Recommended.
19,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice atmosphere, great location. The staff is very friendly and makes you feel right at home. The only drawback is that they show every major soccer game on a zillion screens so that there is no escape. And I am not into soccer so I avoid the place at game time.  :-)"

31,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I come here often for breakfast - these are substantial and good. Also great for a warm lunch on a cold day - stews are good. I would steer away from burgers and nachos etc. Great atmosphere and I‚Äôve always had great service, which compares ‚Ä¶"
32,Aran Irish Pub, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We went to watch the rugby and it was a great place to watch. Good selection of drinks and staff were friendly. Due to dietary requirements I didn't eat in here it's a very pub food menu (probably wouldn't recommend for veggies). Would go to watch sport again as good atmosphere.
33,Aran Irish Pub, 3 stars ,2 years ago,First visit was on a Saturday to have a few drinks whilst watching the football. Was busy but managed well and no issues. Good atmosphere we came at about 6:30 for about two hours and spent about ‚Ç¨40 on drinks between two of us- no issues ‚Ä¶
34,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good looking Irish pub with okay prices. The sandwiches here are good, but don¬¥t be fooled by the names. The ¬®healthy¬® sandwich is with bacon, cheese and eggs, so the term healthy is a suggestion at most! The wait here is fine, as long as ‚Ä¶"

36,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, great atmosphere. As an Irish person I can say they‚Äôve captured the culture very well. I had a full Irish breakfast and a cup of tea which were top notch. It was a bit squished and I was sitting with my back right up against someone else‚Äôs chair but for the most part I was able to ignore it."
37,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food here is truly amazing and delicious. Must try for breakfast is Omelette with ham and cheese, ham & cheese with mushroom. For those of you who would like a sandwich which is amazing is the Healthy sandwich which includes ham, ‚Ä¶"
38,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to have a pint and watch the boats go by. Food is really good too and moderately priced for Amsterdam standards. Nicest Bacon Baguette in the city here. Cooked to perfection and is a generous size. Perfect for the morning after!
39,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The service was extremely bad. The waiter (guy with Irish accent) was not customer friendly at all; up to a point that his attitude and communication towards us was just rude. At first, we thought it was just us, but as we observed him, we ‚Ä¶"
40,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy pub, food looked delicious, drinks were just right and prompt. I can't help but make a stop here every time I'm in town as it's a good location and they usually have football on TV. Good service, and unfortunately I didn't see any elevators for the back area where the toilet is located."
41,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I remember visiting here back in 2004 & they had automatic pumps for the Guinness, it was terrible to say the least!

46,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Well, it's what you would expect from an Irish pub in the city centre, a relatively wide amount of beer but slightly more expensive but prime location, evening team is really fun and music was an honest trowback to all the classic the whole ‚Ä¶"
47,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The waitress was really kind and really nice, that‚Äôs why I put a star.  We asked one beer and one cola. The glasses were dirty, we could see the lipstick in the glass. I asked to the waitress to have two new glasses, he apologized and he ‚Ä¶"

50,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,3 years ago,Extremely poor and rude service. They‚Äôll make you wait easily 15 minutes and when you go to the bar they‚Äôll happily tell you to just sit and wait another 10 minutes. We saw at least 3 other groups leave without getting a drink. I guess they ‚Ä¶

54,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good beer, good place to people watch."
55,Aran Irish Pub, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"‚Ç¨15 for an overcooked burger on a stale bun & slimy salad. Wouldn't recommend eating here but a decent place to grab a pint, although a bit spendy at ‚Ç¨8."
56,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,3 years ago,Location and surroundings really great. Atmosphere and offer typical of a pub. The service is a disaster. Service is rude and outrageous to naughty. Never again !!! Management would be well advised to monitor and train its staff.
57,Aran Irish Pub, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The food was completely average and drinks expensive (‚Ç¨8.50 for a bottle of cider!) Had to pay to use the bathroom even though I was a customer! That was ridiculous üôÑ ‚Ä¶
58,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice bar, only a request, play songs from spotify app it has many good Irish songs , irish pub song is my favorite.
Thank you very much for the beautiful hospitality"
59,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The quintessential of Amsterdam since the 2000s: 7 euros a pint, unfriendly staff that act like they‚Äôre the customers, no creativity. In general the city itself is stuck since 20 years and cannot progress to develop their nightlife despite they could benchmark easily with London and Berlin"
60,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Unbelievably rude staff, couldn't quite believe how miserable they are. It's a pretty poor excuse for an Irish pub... Don't expect even a luke warm welcome or a smile from any of them. I've been here a few times over the past couple of years but I certainly won't be back again."
61,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,3 years ago,Rude staff and they wouldn't let our group pay in couples.  One table one bill!  We walked out.  Terrible customer service.  13 meals and drinks off your bottom line.

64,Aran Irish Pub, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Attentive staff and reasonable drinks selection. Wouldn't say it's a very authentic Irish pub in terms of atmosphere...few rowdy football fans watching the [English] Premier League match kinda tarnished the vibe. Would've stayed for another ‚Ä¶
65,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great bar - made to feel welcome immediately. All staff incredibly friendly, but little shout out to Robbie. Cheers guys"
66,Aran Irish Pub, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to grab a beer and unwind. You have the perfect view and some nice beers. Since it's an Irish Pub don't forget to grab a Guiness!
67,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The service was awful and arrogant, i felt like the bartender is doing me a favour for just talking to me.. the beer was fine though.
NOT recommended."
68,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Don't get seated, you'll be sure to regret. No real Coca Cola, but you get a look alike when you ask for a 'Zero'. The expresso coffee is made with filthy water. Conclusion: Tourist Milkery.
Moreover, it is also very expensive."
69,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They should have the right to call themselves an Irish pub revoked. Shockingly rude staff. The worst I've experienced in a long time. Not just one person either, it seems like a job requirement to work here is being a jerk."

87,Aran Irish Pub, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horrible! Arrogant staff providing poor service. It is a pity they serve so many tourists it must give such a bad image of the restaurant service in Amsterdam.
88,Aran Irish Pub, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and great place, right after the Leidsebrugge. The tables outside overview the canal and boats passing. Food was excellent. Try broth for a change :)"
