0,Agabi Santa Maria, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The food was delicious! We had spare ribs, fajitas and enchilada.  Very friendly staff."
1,Agabi Santa Maria, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I visited this restaurant with my girlfriend. It was empty on a Friday night at 7:30 but we thought we'd give it a go. My steak was quite good, however chips were undercooked. The enchiladas were not great. The food was quite expensive for the quality."
2,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Tourist trap!!!

First of all, you don't know where the entrance is. 3 doors are open, but ‚Ä¶"
3,Agabi Santa Maria, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So happy to find a place with a good tomato soup and a GREAT beer, yes it is so Argentinian place, I love it"
4,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,3 years ago,"One of the worst meals I‚Äôve ever had. Food was cooked in the microwave and cost 19 Euros for one dish. This is a huge scam, don‚Äôt consider eating here. We had fajitas, enchiladas and chaliquile. All the dishes were cold in the center and very watery. Tourist trap! Scam!"
5,Agabi Santa Maria, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Never in my life I had anything this bad! The only hot thing here was the plate, but the food cold, old , dry tacos, cooked instead of fried meat, cooked salad etc. And finally...that hair in a piece of chicken!!! ‚Ä¶"
6,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,3 years ago,"In one word. Overpriced.
You pay a lot for the service they offer. The meat is ok. All the rest is under expectations. ‚Ä¶"
7,Agabi Santa Maria, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Fine restaurant with very friendly staff. The food was good and tasteful. The prices were a bit high. It was a bit confusing that outside there was a sign: Steak 9 euro, which was for the restaurant next door."
8,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The worst burrito I ve ever ate. And that for ""only"" 17 Euros. 8 of the 10 beers were not on stock so I had to take a corona. Which was served warm. After all we had wasted a lot of money for waiting on simply bad food. Not recommended."
9,Agabi Santa Maria, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I had fajitas and my man had a steak both dishes took 20mins and we're both cooked to perfection. Best meal I've had in a long time and was as fresh as you get. Go in and eat I promise it's so good. Tracy from Scotland
10,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,4 years ago,"So we arrived at 7pm no other customers, one lady serving. We order 4 nachos and one enchalada. It took 45min to get the friggin nachoes. There were supposed to have chillie sauce, ONLY ONE DRIP!? she said it's underneath, nope. And chicken ‚Ä¶"
11,Agabi Santa Maria, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Lovely little place. Owners are very friendly. The argentinian steak is lovely: moisty and tasteful. Selection of mexican beers as you would expect. Decent housewines. I've been there multiple times. They are not always as fast as they should be but then again, it's no fast food joint and the atmosphere more than makes up for it!"
12,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,6 years ago,"This was one of the worst meals I have ever had. With my son looking around and hungry about 7pm. one old lady serving cooking etc. Asked for veggie tortilla (was supossed to be mexican)! meal consisted of a few tortilla chips, side dish ‚Ä¶"
13,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst place ever! Over priced. I‚Äôve never felt so scammed. The food was cold in the center and the portions were way too little for the hight price they have. They could at least put some salad in my plate! A lettuce and half a Romano at least! It‚Äôs a scheme
14,Agabi Santa Maria, 5 stars ,8 months ago,All the food was served fast and it was very tasty! And very friendly owners!
15,Agabi Santa Maria, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Being Argentinean, I can definitely confirm this is far, very very far from Argentinean. I was very disappointed: 1) Empanadas don't even have the shape of empanadas, they're made of paprika and onions (no beef??) 2) They advertise steak ‚Ä¶"
16,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,2 years ago,The food was very bad and over priced. The service was horrible they charge even for ketchup and Mayo 1.5 Euro. And they don‚Äôt take visa or master card... I never will go back there
17,Agabi Santa Maria, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was good. It was primarily Mexican with only 1-2 Argentinian options on the menu. The chicken Santa Maria fajitas were good
18,Agabi Santa Maria, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice hosts and great food. Can absolutely recommend it.

Very helpful. They even gave us a bag for our goods when we asked."
19,Agabi Santa Maria, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Really nice food and lovely staff. Best steak i've had in 4 years!!!
My wife had a freshly made burritos-she loved it! Higly recommend to visit this restaurant!"
20,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,2 years ago,Food was ok but beware. They will charge you for bathroom and this is a CASH only place except maestro.  There is a puny sign that they take maestro but no sign that says only cash and no visa. Beware!
21,Agabi Santa Maria, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I ordered the 9.50 euro menu but all I became was a small piece of steak and some potato sticks which are called ""fries""

22,Agabi Santa Maria, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A quiet and beautiful place, Mr. Hani (the owner of the restaurant), has exceptional experience in serving grilled steak. I would recommend visiting him"
