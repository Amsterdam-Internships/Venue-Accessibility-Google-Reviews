0,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Honestly wish I‚Äôd taken more photos to do this review justice. The food, the wine and the service were exceptional. So much so that we made sure to shake hands with the owner and thank him personally. Do not let the 4.5 star fool you. It ‚Ä¶"
1,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The absolute best wine bar you will go to in Amsterdam. I have been to many wine bars across the world and this one has some bottles (and by the glass) selections that will make you glad you visited. Awarded with one of the best selections ‚Ä¶
2,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This place is a gem.  So glad we randomly found it walking through Amsterdam.  Johnny, who served us, was on point and extremely knowledgeable on all wines.  The vibe is relaxing and sophisticated.  Johnny took his time to explain the ‚Ä¶"
3,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing place! Was recommended by another Dutch-owned wine shop down the street. Super friendly couple running it. Best place to try a variety of wines from the region. Ask about tastings. Good prices too. Highly recommended.
4,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Quintessential wine bar!
Wine flights of many wine regions of the world!!
Or by the glass.... the charcuterie,  bread .. olive along with the wine tasting are of the highest quality."
5,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great wine! We had the sparkling and ros√© tastings and they were incredible! Staff was mighty friendly. Would've loved some less mainstream poppy music but it might've been just the first song I heard ;). Still expected other music in this very nice setting.
6,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Central but in a quiet street. The bar is cozy and relaxed staff is friendly and helpful. If you don't know what to pick you can do a sort of a tasting for a really reasonable price and you get 3 glasses of the same category, like bubbles, ‚Ä¶"
7,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Quite an expensive place but a great range of wines and some fantastic nibble style food too. ‚Ä¶
8,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Limited ambience in the dark, anonymous corridor of a bar, but the wine list is fantastic. I liked in particular their ‚Äòtrio‚Äô of half glasses in tasting combinations. Snacks and bar food were surprisingly good. The seeds of a great venue but somewhat flawed if you are not seated at the bar."
9,Bubbles & Wine, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Not friendly to Americans, harassed by other guests, no staff got involved

Yes, I can explain more, do you have an email i can write to? We were there on October 8th from 11:40 until midnight."
10,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent bar! Cosy. Great wine selection. Great ""bites"" food. Great service. Nice staff. Overall great experience! We were not looking for and were very glad we found it!"
11,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful classy and sophisticated wine bar. Had a beautiful champagne. Romantic and decorated well. Huge wine menu! Very impressive and snacks too with cheese boards, caviar and jamon."
12,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A great selection of global wines by the glass,  and an even greater selection by the bottle. Seemed like a really fun place to meet and socialize."
13,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Incredible selection of drinks, unbelievable atmosphere and sophisticated but warm decor. Very classy but relaxed. Very warm staff too. May be the best wine bar I've ever been to. Real hidden gem. Top class."
14,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great venue, nice wine selections. The cheese and charcuterie is a nice compliment"
15,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly, warm and cozy winebar. Great wine and friendly service. One staffmember very helpful and friendly, the other kept looking away whilst talking to us. Couldn't hear what he was saying, that was odd."
16,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great atmosphere, super friendly and knowledgeable staff, and a ton of options!"
17,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic wine bar. Really friendly staff with a good selection of wines and snacks.

19,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy place with good service, staff is welcoming and helpful, located in central Amsterdam but surprisingly quiet and less crowded! In case you want to avoid crowds and just chill, this is the best place to visit. Quite a lot to choose from ‚Ä¶"
20,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for champagne and wine. Will def go back. Google says it's cash only but that'd incorrect. All major credit cards accepted.
21,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great wine place with an easy option for a small wine tasting. As a snack I can recommend the Cheese Plate.
22,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very knowable staff.  Try the samples and you will be embellished  in your  knowledge. To sample their entire expansive range  would be a very long stay indeed
23,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Tucked in a little street that leads away from Dam Square this bar has been a personal long time favorite.  The range of wines offered by the glass is really very good.  Being able to have a 'flight' of wines to get a good understanding of ‚Ä¶
24,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent for a girls night. I got a table outside with 2 friends, 2 bottles of wine and 2 snack boards. Great experience! Jonny was very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely go again üòä"

27,Bubbles & Wine, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I read about Bubble & Wines before my trip and it was one of the many things I was very excited about. I love champagne. I‚Äôm not a big champagne drinker. Certainly not a connoisseur or anything, but I really enjoy it. For me, it‚Äôs a once in ‚Ä¶"
28,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite wine bar in Amsterdam, located in a rather quiet location on the Nes, just off Dam square. Wine bars come and go but Bubbles & Wines has now been around for a number of years. Excellent and varied wine menu withm more than 50 ‚Ä¶"
29,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Go here. It‚Äôs great. Tell the owner or server your favorite kind of wine and expect a recommendation, a bit of education, and an overall excellent experience."
30,Bubbles & Wine, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I‚Äôm vaccined, but my vaccine disaccepted‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm was discriminated."
31,Bubbles & Wine, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Extensive wine list. Prices into the thousands. Not too many wines by the glass. One of the few wine bars i know that offers interesting flights. Some small food bites. Overall aimed at being fancy and chic.
32,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great wine selection. Good flight options as well.
33,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great spot. I'm actually here right now and it's great. Yesterday it was quiet but the staff was great and k knowledgeable. Tonight, I talked wine with the bartender and got some great advice (and a little taster üòÅ) of cheese to go with my port. I'd come back any time!"
34,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were looking for a Wine Bar in Amsterdam to spend a late afternoon at, and found Bubbles & Wine through one of the Amsterdam magazines.
Bubbles is clean with plenty of seating, and a long bar for you to taste at. ‚Ä¶"
35,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"AMAZING wine, food, champagne...the owner and staff are exceptionally super nice! Hands down, one of the top go to places in Amsterdam. The service is exceptional."
36,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, good wine and perfect services."
37,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We loved this place for a quiet retreat when visiting the city. Fabulous wines and tasty nibbles to accompany. A hidden gem that we will hunt down again on our next trip!
38,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,6 years ago,The premiere wine bar in Amsterdam. The prices are a little high but for a special occasion or that glass of something special this is the place. I especially liked the flight of bubbles and the cheese plate. The staff are friendly and jovial. A lovely change from Dam Square.
39,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"An absolutely stunning place! The atmosphere makes you feel both special and cosy, it is a luxurious yet unpretentious place with a collection of wines and champagne that would leave you with a dizzy head‚Ä¶literally, haha! And also, should I even mention how extremely friendly and welcoming the staff is!"
40,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great by the glass wine selection including a number of different wine flights. The only nit I'll pick is that the atmosphere is very dark and I think it comes off as a little bit less inviting than most wine bars.
41,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful little place. Knowledgeable staff. Had a great time taking a load off and relaxing with a flight of wines! Would love to come back again!
42,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice environment. Excellent selection of wines. Great place to grab a glass of wine and relax
43,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We stopped in for a few drinks after dinner. Really enjoyed the wine and champagne flights. Felt kind of pricey for what you were getting, but overall a good experience."
44,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Top of the rock. Excellent champagne, caviar choice and service. We need a booking for a restaurant,  they did it for us,  and taked care we had an extra caring service because they know the restaurant manager.
That's what makes coustomers happy to come back"
45,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good wines. Nice atmosphere. Super friendly staff. Would definitely come back! :)
46,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great wines, love the location but they are pretty expensive. For some of there wine selection I do understand that but the side dishes are really overpriced."
47,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Awesome selection of wines and flights available. Inside is a little small with limited seating. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff!
48,Bubbles & Wine, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"because there are so many wines by the glass, we had a couple come out that were not fresh.  one of which they insisted was.  not acceptable.  food is really nice though."
49,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Quality in wine and food is what you get here. And quality has a price. Here you will find wines that you will not find in other places. Walk in and enjoy the nice atmosphere and nice people
50,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The bartenders were very nice and provided helpful traveling advice.
It s a very cozy, but elegant atmosphere.  They have wi-fi too!"
51,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best wine bar in town. Great selection and their flights are fantastic if you don't know what to choose.
52,Bubbles & Wine, 1 star ,2 years ago,The place is nice but the customer services is terrible. The girl was nasty with my boy. The waitress that our attention was insistently arrogant and the treatment was humiliating.
53,Bubbles & Wine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A little spendy but for sure a cool place to stop in for a glass of wine while your out shopping.  The also give an airline discount.
54,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Visiting this place each time I come to Amsterdam
55,Bubbles & Wine, 2 stars ,5 years ago,The pretention of this place far outweigh it's wine selection. Instead of the normal Spa rode you get this exquisite 'gently sparkling water' ... You get the idea.
56,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Magip place !!! Romantic, great wines, a dream !!!!"
57,Bubbles & Wine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent staff, amazing wine, and great side dishes, they really take good care of you at this place!"
