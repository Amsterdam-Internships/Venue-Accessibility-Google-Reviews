0,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,a month ago,Really good food at a pretty reasonable price. We showed up 20 minutes before they closed (sorry!) and they still gave us great service. Make sure to ask for a fork and napkins if you plan on taking food to go!
1,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Ashaming and disgusting experience !!!
So, I‚Äôm a long time loyal taco mundo customer, Since 2018.

2,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Cheats Delivery:
Taco Mundo always seem to be looking to save on Delivery despite paying their couriers for the delivery they never come on time. ‚Ä¶"
3,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Ordered some Tacos and they tasted like near death, like something was not right about those. Delivery guy was nice though. But don‚Äôt get the Tacos."
4,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,10 months ago,"I've never given a restaurant one star before but the food was really that bad. The food was cold when it arrived, even though the carrier arrived within 20 minutes. ‚Ä¶"
5,Taco Mundo, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I ordered a veggie salad, probably the worst salad in the history of salads. 3(!) tortija chips at the bottom tasted like they have been trapped there forever, the black beans that should be there were missing (!) and the sauce roja and jalapenos were terribly spicy like I wanted to torture myself. Never again."
6,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"‚Äú25 minute average delivery time‚Äù is far from accurate. Prepare to wait at least an hour.
Would be quicker to just go and pick it up yourself. No, actually scratch that. ‚Ä¶"
7,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,7 months ago,Almost hit me driving the wrong way at 30km+ on a pedestrian priority zone. Their response? Are there cameras? You can't arrest me.
8,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Great food, but long time of waiting

I‚Äôm probably guys have too many orders"
9,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"My sister ate there I just accompanied. Next day she had food poisoning so strong they almost refused us to board, we had to get a fit to fly letter for her. She didn't eat much more on that day than in Taco Mundo so I would be carefull..."
10,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!

Food arrived 1hr 20mins after ordering. Delivery time was stated to be 30mins ‚Ä¶"
11,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,7 years ago,Attention! FOOD NEVER CAME! I made the order and PAID on-line but the order never came home. I cycled for half an hour to the Taco Mundo shop and they told me that they could not give me my money back and I had to send an e-mail through the ‚Ä¶
12,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,It took 7 minutes for two or them to figure out how to put one burrito and one drink on the system. Then another few minutes to navigate the card reader. And still managed to mess up the order. Walked out without the order.
13,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing - food is legit and super cheap. The churros are delicious and the staff are so friendly. Yaaas taco mundo u rock. also there is a vegetarian option for each menu item so extra yes thank u ‚ù§Ô∏è
14,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious tacos! Absolutely perfect!! Thank you!
15,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,We didnt receive our order and tried to contact via phone and email and no response we are still waiting it's the next day and still havent heard anything back and still didnt get the food I expect a reply and a full refund very disappointed
16,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,a year ago,"Got the order wrong, phone number not working and no response from the online customer service. Don‚Äôt waste your time with them."
17,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I asked for the extra bread and even though i wanted the pay for it amigo who works there said he doesnt know how much to charge and got so angry.Then he used f... word to my face.So moral of the story, you can eat there but get ready to be insulted."
18,Taco Mundo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Maybe not the most authentic Mexican in town, but tasty nonetheless. Very reasonably priced and I'm guessing it's a healthier option than let's say mc Donald's for a quick bite."
19,Taco Mundo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Enjoyed the food.
Lovely flavors.
Especially quesadilla, guacamole, salsa was amazing.
Fries are to die for."
20,Taco Mundo, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"They're definitely not the best tacos but when in Amsterdam you don't have a lot of room to be picky when it comes to tacos, unfortunately."
21,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,The bowl was 8 euro.. It was chips with a dash of rice and meat... Save your money.. This place is a Mexican Subway.
22,Taco Mundo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Sloppy food. Degrading service. No relevance to Mexican food whatsoever. Waste of time and money. I hope I dont get a food poison.
