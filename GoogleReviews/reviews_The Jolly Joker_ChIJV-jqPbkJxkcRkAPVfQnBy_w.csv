0,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great experience! We spent every of our 3 evenings at this coffee shop. Reminds one of an pub. The guy at the counter was super funny and helpful and if you‚Äôre lucky, you can get a table at the top floor."
1,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Such an amazing place. Will remember coming here with my sisters all my life. Such a fantastic vibe. Will come every time we visit Amsterdam. Can not wait.
2,The Jolly Joker, 1 star ,2 months ago,Since there is take away the door is locked. There was nobody to help me. After trying to open the door a couple times a very upset person told me in a very rude way to stop shaking the door. ‚Ä¶
3,The Jolly Joker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome little coffeeshop in a prime location. Reasonable prices and decent menu. Quite small with limited seating but much quieter and more relaxed than other coffeeshops we frequented. Good to see they were so vigilante about ID'ing ‚Ä¶
4,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,When I visit Amsterdam I always stop here to load up for my night. The pre rolls usually have 70/30 tobacco and weed ratio but I often order 2 grams to roll my own. They have everything u need when it comes to rolling up. Had a panic attack one morning while sitting up top with some friends. But I‚Äôm pretty sure I was just really high

12,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was one of my favourite coffee shops in Amsterdam, just on the edge of the res light district. Staff was friendly, but seating was limited."

14,The Jolly Joker, 1 star ,a year ago,very bad attention two girls very carefree about the business. In addition to buying joints made only of tobacco and they did not accept me to return them. I started charging the phone and they asked me to disconnect it immediately! without ‚Ä¶

16,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great coffee shop with a warm and classic vibe! They had awesome friendly staff. Limited seating but it's worth it. Coming all the way from Texas I would definitely recommend!
17,The Jolly Joker, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Big guy behind the bar was rude and arrogant. When passing the drinks menu to my mrs (while i bought the weed) he shoved the weed menu in my face and demanded i purchased their product first. Cool interior however, average weed, quite pricey."
18,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What can I say but I love his coffeeshop. Great location and selection of buds. So many people walking by to watch. Just sit back toke and try to spot the locals amongst the tourists. Take a wicked bong hit by the window for all the people ‚Ä¶

21,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely great place to have your coffee and smoke. Music is on point not to loud but just enough. Peeeerfect! If you are in Amsterdam you have to come through!
22,The Jolly Joker, 1 star ,6 years ago,"This would actually be a nice place to have a smoke of it wasn't for the man behind the counter. We were there for literally 5 minutes, and he was rude to me and 3 other people who came in. Also, you can't smoke your own weed in here, even ‚Ä¶"

24,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A nice shop we enjoyed every visit during our stay. It was well stocked, good prices (in comparison) plenty of beverages to choose from. It‚Äôs a must for us every time we visit, and it never lets us down. Great couple of hours spent watching people enjoy this beautiful city."
25,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,a year ago,"First time to Amsterdam, always wanted to visit this place.  Flight delay gave us literally 24 hrs here and we enjoyed every minute of it!  Jolly Joker was a great coffee shop that wasn't intimidating at all.  Went up to the bar,  ordered a ‚Ä¶"
26,The Jolly Joker, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"After several separate visits to this coffeeshop, I can only say that the interior was cozy but that's about it. The staff was not friendly and I did not feel welcome even though I bought their smoke and drink. They do not let you buy a ‚Ä¶"
27,The Jolly Joker, 1 star ,3 years ago,DON'T BUY THEIR SPACE CAKES! COMPLETE RIP-OFF! Tried 2 of them at different times and NOTHING happened. Same for my friends who are not even smokers. The only high we got was from the sugar in the cupcake...

Can be a little bit overcrowded but if you're going at the right time you gonna ‚Ä¶"
29,The Jolly Joker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice coffeeshop, it's comfortable, the weed is good and it's not one of the more expensive in town. Only downside for me is that the barman kept putting the music louder and louder it was sometimes difficult to speak with my friends at the same table."
30,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Small and cosy coffee shop with a small but satisfying selection of weed, drinks and snacks. Great atmosphere with very unique wall decorations. Friendly staff, great atmosphere.

31,The Jolly Joker, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice place.  Great weed. A real favorite when in Amsterdam.
32,The Jolly Joker, 1 star ,a year ago,Very bad welcoming in this coffee shop. The seller is not warm to us and talk badly . You also have to buy weed first to get a drink.

36,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of our favorite coffee shops in Dam! Always try to get here when visiting. Last visit October 3rd 2018. Had the Jack Herrer & Cheese. Both very good with a decent buzz. They don't have a dealer as such as the weed they sell is pre ‚Ä¶
37,The Jolly Joker, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Blonde lady who works here is incredibly impatient. I didn't understand her point of view concerning ""maestro"" atm cards, trying to explain to her that it's an American MasterCard Debit which also works on maestro. She immediately became super nasty."

39,The Jolly Joker, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Everything was fine, ok selection not that huge. As always ask the staff if you would like to find your mood essence! Staff was friendly. Store is situated in a corner so can get crampy at times, but overall relaxed atmosphere."
40,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We didn‚Äôt actually go inside this coffee shop but my mum slipped and fell right outside and the staff was so incredibly kind and helpful, bringing her a chair and water. Lovely people, you should absolutely patronize this place!"

44,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to pop in and have a quick smoke before you carry on with the touring of Amsterdam. The pre rolled and mixes were excellent and would recommend most to pop in and have a look.
45,The Jolly Joker, 4 stars ,9 years ago,Clean place awesome weed and laid back people from all walks of life.  Met a 6th grade teach that share some mind blowing hash.  Found a great house boat to live on near Jolly so I'll be visiting back when I return.
46,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My all time favourite coffee shop!!
47,The Jolly Joker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place, friendly personnel and good prices. The only min point is that the place was full of smoke, thus breathing in there was tricky."
48,The Jolly Joker, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Came here once before a couple of years ago and didn't like it. Came again this time and it's alright. Not the friendliest but a nice bar to sit at and no need to use herbal mix like in other places. Would visit again

61,The Jolly Joker, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Bad service, good environment"
62,The Jolly Joker, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"Our experience here was funny, but not in a good way. The staff seem overly focussed on profit which ironcally probably means they make less profit as people gradually learn to stay away. Here are a couple of examples: ‚Ä¶"
63,The Jolly Joker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Glenn was awesome. Really cool dude. Great place to sit and have a smoke! Fantastic music too!
64,The Jolly Joker, 2 stars ,9 years ago,At any bar in town you can buy a drink then take a massive dump in their toilet. At this coffeeshop they won't even sell you a drink without buying from their weed menu. I wasn't even there for a dump. Avoid.
65,The Jolly Joker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The weed is God, but the service is not that great. Also not so many places to sit to enjoy what you just bought. Worth a go,"
66,The Jolly Joker, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Small and cosy close to the main streets and areas. Chilled atmosphere even if a little cramped at times, just need to find a good spot!"
67,The Jolly Joker, 1 star ,8 years ago,"1* joker coffeeshop. We went in for a drink and smoke but were greeted by ""show me some id's guy"" (tall Nordic type dude with glasses). Then we both (me stoned & my gf) showed our id's and were ready to order some drinks, the dealer flashed ‚Ä¶"
