0,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Been a customer here for the last 5 years, always good food, nice portion sizes, always tastes great and they usually hire friendly people too. Highly recommend if you're in the area!"
1,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty food, at a very good price. We had the vegetarian fajitas burrito which proven to be more than enough, we could barely finish. The nachos were also very tasty. Good overall experience, only lacking some comfort in the table area. Even this was understandable as its main business is take out and delivery"
2,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great food and really large portions! I got two of the veggie tacos and could barely finish them! They are definitely worth the money!
3,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Tomatillo has the best burritos in Amsterdam. I know because I've tried most of them! Their ranchero style burrito is a thing of beauty.. I mean: just look at it! Thumbs up.
4,Tomatillo, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious!  Also probably the best tortilla chips in Amsterdam.
Edit: What happened to the chips?!  They were no longer thin and handmade the last order.  So sad, they were the only good chips in town."
5,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice and fresh. Very friendly staff that make the food to our taste. Also answer all our questions politely and in very good detail. If you like Tex-mex, this is definitely the place to go!"
6,Tomatillo, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Worst Mexican food I've ever had delivered.
Burnt smell, Soggy Tacos, steak was gross, we threw out a 50 euro meal"
7,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"They make the best burritos that I've tried in Amsterdam so far, compared to multiple others I've tried. …"
8,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Hands down the best Mexican food I've eaten in Amsterdam
9,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,a year ago,My very favorite place in Amsterdam to get good Burritos! I really recommend trying the Tempeh Burritos. It’s not super nice to sit inside but they deliver and Vondelpark is just around the corner. With every order you get a free bag of nachos.
10,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Great food, and great serving sizes. The order process could be described in a more straightforward way, because new customers might feel overwhelmed without a process to follow."
11,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We got burritos here to eat as dinner in the Vondelpark. They have a great variety of sauces with different levels of spice and the burritos are a good size and very filling. The food was very good, however maybe a bit on the pricy side. …"
12,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty Mexican food for a quick lunch or dinner. Not very different from Salsa shop, however the salsas tasted quite nice. I tried their  veggie burrito and it was huge. The chips are okay."
13,Tomatillo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Salsas are very good and the taco shells are tasty and authentic, but the ingredient ratio in the tacos seemed a bit off.  Tasty, but not fantastic. If you do go, the pork tacos were the best of all the ones I tried there."
14,Tomatillo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"1. The food is way less than average for a Mexican.
2. The place is very small and had only three very modest tables with uncomfortable seats. …"
15,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I got the Fajita Burrito with ranchero sauce, which was delicious. It was huge and came in a little box without any cutlery... It was really hard to not make a mess out of the place where I was eating. I had to destroy the box to be able to …"
16,Tomatillo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Oh goodness I want to like this place but they just seem to pour liquid smoke into a tortilla and call it a day. They must think it tastes good because I don't think anyone would intentionally mess up a burrito this badly. I grew up in …
17,Tomatillo, 1 star ,2 years ago,I used to work nearby and visited this place quite frequently. The guys working there were very nice and the service & food used to be great. …
18,Tomatillo, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Nothing special about this place. I loved quite some time in Arizona and there I had the best Mexican food I ever had. This place doesn't even come close. I suppose if you are a student with no taste buds. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend. Good quality is below average. Price is in line with Amsterdam for a place like this.
19,Tomatillo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ordered a vegan tempeh burrito and got a burrito with cheese. When I returned it the employee acted like it was my fault for not noticing there was cheese sooner. They made a new one correctly which tasted great. Shame about the mistake first time round!
20,Tomatillo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Slightly underwhelmed by my experience at this place, long waiting times due to this being a popular spot with online food deliveries (delivered from here myself in fact). Food is alright but definitely not the most authentic texmex you'll …"
21,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place has the best burritos in Amsterdam, hands down. I always eat a veggie fajita burrito with habanero sauce inside, tomatillo style. Plus the portions are very large. Never disappoints. They deliver but I always call ahead to pick up on my way home from work"
22,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,11 months ago,If I could eat Tomatillo burrito's every day for the rest of my life without ever getting tired of it I would do it. My (almost) weekly guilty pleasure and probably the best burritos in town.
23,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"In my opinion they sell the best burritos in town. I especially recommend, to make your burrito ""Ranchero style"", as it makes this amazing food even better!"
24,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Probably the best burritos in Amsterdam. Good variety of tasty salsas and above average guacamole. I recommend the tempeh burrito for vegetarians.
I would disregard a lot of the 1 star reviews. It's a good meal for a decent price. True Tex-Mex it is not, but if you want true tex-mex, go to Texas!"
25,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Love this place. I always do takeaway from here when I crave good Mexican food. Love they have vegetarian options- the tempeh is awesome. My go-to dish is the tempeh fajita burrito smothered with the tomatillo & ranchero sauces. Portions are large, I usually get 2 meals out of 1 burrito. So good. Never had a bad meal here!"
26,Tomatillo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I can't even describe how disappointed I am because of the service I got at this place. The way employees of this ""restaurant"" treat their customers is just outrageous. Expecting to have some good Mexican food me and my friends (5 of us in …"
27,Tomatillo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Really disappointing, boritto was not full of the flavour I would expect with tex mex/mexican food, all I could taste was sour cream and cheese, there was no balance and even less meat, 3 small bits of beef in the half boritto I managed to …"
28,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A quick grab and go or you could sit and eat, if you are lucky to find a seat there! Burritos are really good. They are freshly made. Decent try if you are around!"
29,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent food. Nice the chefs experiment around. For example they have baked tempeh as filling. My favorite is by far the Burrito Fajita Chicken Ranchero Style with habernero salsa.
30,Tomatillo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible place and fake food. Dont believe the positive messages. The beef burrito doesnt contain any beef, only wet rice and black beans. The only 'meat' you can discover is very bad tasting fat kind of meat. And it is not even warm. 2 burrito and 1 beer is 37 euro!"
31,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"I had the Tostada Steak, and I loved it. Very tasty and ingredients seemed fresh. Kind of messy and hard to eat, but I always have trouble eating Mexican food. Seems to end up everywhere besides my mouth sometimes. …"
32,Tomatillo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It was tasty but the burritos where basically all beans and rice, hardly any meat at all and no sour cream or guacamole, for €12 a burrito I expected alot more unfortunately..."
33,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good Mexican food with both veg and non veg. Good atmosphere and staff is very friendly. There are varieties of Mexican food and all are worth trying.
34,Tomatillo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's not bad, but for anyone familiar with authentic Mexican food it will be a let down. Not too fancy of a place, but works just fine. Lots of vegetarian options and friendly staff. Important to note, they only take cash or Maestro cards."
35,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Friendly people run this small restaurant geared towards takeaway. Below average prices, good portions, and great salsas, fresh homemade chips all add up to quality."
36,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Speaking as a Transplanted Texan living in Amsterdam...this is THE place.  The food is spot on from the amazing huevos rancheros to the overstuffed burritos.  I can't tell you a favorite because it is all fresh, tasty and mostly organic and …"
37,Tomatillo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I am from Texas and my husband is from California and live in Amsterdam. We know what real Tex Mex tastes like and the food here is not even remotely close to true Tex Mex. To be honest, we couldn't even finish our meal. The guacamole was …"
38,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A very cool place to eat. The kitchen opens quite early, the stuff are friendly and you could easily ask for recommendations. Moreover, the balance between the price and quality is excellent!"
39,Tomatillo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We ordered takeaway and it was borderline disgusting. My chicken was undercooked and everything tasted bland, cold and uninspired. …"
40,Tomatillo, 1 star ,a year ago,"Poor quality , poor presentation...we receive our order incomplete, with sauce..."
41,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best Burritos anywhere. Yes, I said anywhere.  This is the best one I have had so far, ever. Ordered a fajita burrito with tomatillo sauce and extra cheese.  This is what you want."
42,Tomatillo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I found Ritos much better value for money and seemed fresher and had lovely fillings. This has only rice beans & cheese and is overpriced.
43,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious! Not a fancy interior but that doesn't matter one bit because the staff is excellent and the food is amazing! Probably the best tex-mex I've ever had.
44,Tomatillo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Disappointing food and attitude

We went to have a steak burrito …"
45,Tomatillo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"A pity no zero available. We were 3 couples tonight, from each me my order didn't get served, even after paying the order. After 30 minutes an employee come and gave the justification that 'you didn't order from me, but from my colleague …"
46,Tomatillo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Totally let me down man! Submitted an order via Uber Eats to be delivered an hour later. Then 10 mins before delivery time they cancelled :( Don’t take an order if you are not willing to deliver!
47,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Large portions, good salsas. Veggie quesadilla only has cheese. Little choice in beer and quite expensive."
48,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Got burritos vía Uber eats, quick with 6 person order and also accommodated the requests in notes! Will definitely be ordering again!"
49,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"easily the best Mexican in Amsterdam. Affordable, consistently fresh and excellent food.  If I could give them 6 stars I would.  Lovely staff too!"
50,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice and friendly, thought the price was a bit steep then a burrito the size of my head came out which was super tasty. Not perfect but great."
51,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Very good place: they have different kinds of burritos and tacos, tasty and generous. Price is a little bit high, but not exaggerated, worth it."
52,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The best.
53,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I am no expert but the taste and texture was great. Mostly a take away and delivery setup but some tables up the front.
54,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food from this place is simply amazing. We always order food through their website, so don't know what the restaurant is like."
55,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best burritos I've found so far in Amsterdam. The prize/quality/quantity is 10 out of 10 stars.
56,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably the best burrito I have eaten in Amsterdam, very hard to beat. Great service and friendly staff."
57,Tomatillo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good salsas, but overall the burrito was bland: both the rice and black beans were unseasoned and they make up half the burrito"
58,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Arguably the best burrito in Amsterdam. Chicken is my favourite as it is always crispy.
59,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best TexMex places in Amsterdam, at a fair price."
60,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Don't expect a polished interior or fine dining experience but do expect fantastic food (the salmon burrito is a particular treat) and you won't be disappointed!
61,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious burritos!
62,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Tasty, uncomplicated Mexican food for reasonable prices. You can eat there or take away."
63,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super delicious breakfast burrito - very happy I recently discovered this place.
64,Tomatillo, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"A good mexicandutch restaurant but nothing out of this world. It is a bit overpiced, considering that you are only eating normal quality food."
65,Tomatillo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Please dont serve mexican food. Its terrible. Tacos are at most 1€. Not 5
66,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great mexican food like Tacos, Fajitas, Burritos. Expensive but great servings."
67,Tomatillo, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Our experience was not great. The food was average. Maybe better to just stick to takeaway
68,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,THEEE tastiest!! Get their burrito atleast once a week.
69,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff is amazingly friendly, and the food, for what it is, is exactly what you'd expect at a reasonable price."

71,Tomatillo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worst Burrito, expensive, bad quality and bad actitud from the cook... 🤮🤮🤢🤢👎👎👎👎"

73,Tomatillo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is good, they prioritize delivery orders before in person so my suggestion is to order online"
74,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"The best tex-mex in Amsterdam hands down. Try the pineapple or chipotle salsa, it's unreal."
75,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Always a party in your mouth. Highly recommend the freshly made Tacos.
76,Tomatillo, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great texmex food. Good meat, best beans in town... I guess"

83,Tomatillo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good, but they need to work more on their salsas"
