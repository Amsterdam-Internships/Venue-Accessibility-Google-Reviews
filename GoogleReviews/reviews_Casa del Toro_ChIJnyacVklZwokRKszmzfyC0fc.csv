1,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Casa del Toro has one of the best vibes of any restaursnt I’ve been to in the city— the bar has a giant guitar on the ceiling and the garden area is super cute. They were super accommodating to customize my veggie quesadilla with the …

4,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best margaritas. And their homemade salsa and chips rocks. Highly recommend. The staff was very friendly.
5,Casa del Toro, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Order chips& guac and two tacos. The chips are well seasoned and crunchy, which we enjoyed a lot. However, the tacos were off. The pescado taco was salty but blend otherwise, and the portobello taco was saggy. The service was nice."
6,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fresh and delicious food and drinks. Happy hour is from 5-7 with half price cocktails. Cocktails are creative and made by an experienced mixologist. …
7,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Casa sel Toro is my go to Mexican restaurant! The tacos are delicious as well as the quesadilla.

9,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Go for the appetizers. Steer clear of the tacos.

12,Casa del Toro, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"There was a $50 minimum per person, which is a lot when a small menu is made up of tapas style dishes. We struggled to reach the $50/person. Food was ok, I definitely have had better food. There was a performer which is a girl doing …"

19,Casa del Toro, 3 stars ,10 months ago,"Pretty disappointed in the experience as a whole. If you’re going just to see the aerialist shows at 7:45, be prepared for the fact that the show is about 6 minutes long and every hour or hour and a half. The aerialist is wonderful but the …"
20,Casa del Toro, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Sangria was good so as the guac and chips.
Keep it mind that this is not a casual & nice priced place."
21,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there for their grand opening and loved it! Food, drinks and atmosphere were amazing. I especially loved the shrimp tacos! The chips they use for their guacamole have a perfect spice to them and need a shout out, as well! We ordered a …"

23,Casa del Toro, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"Tasty elevated Mexican restaurant. For an app, we got the tostada, which was smaller than we expected.

34,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food and service was great! We were a party of 8 so I know that is difficult to deal with and given COVID times, that much more difficult. We appreciate being accommodated outside and table adjusted to be further distanced from other …"
35,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food was incredible, prices were reasonable (Toto are we in Manhattan anymore?), service was great and the garden patio was a lovely escape from the rush of sidewalk eating. Will be coming AGAIN and AGAIN.
Oh and they allow dogs :) and immediately bring them water bowls"
36,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I went there Last weekend for Halloween Dia Del Los Muertos event,  cocktails were amazing and I also recommend the tequila flight tastings, I tried the Grand Patron and my friend Siete Léguas. Staff were all dressed up for the occasion which was nice to find a place with great ambiance and festive style- specially nowadays!"
37,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Modern Mexican fare. Tacos served by the piece, so easy to mix and match.
Very accommodating and friendly. Be prepared for a 10 minute wait, but you’ll be offered to order drink while waiting."
38,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was there for the grand opening. Just great ! The service is really good, amazing cocktails, performers (yes we had a contortionist on the bar) and food. I had the Tlayuda and shrimp tacos .... very tasty ! A great new spot in the neighborhood."
39,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Great tacos and service. Austyn was fantastic! Will be back for sure.
40,Casa del Toro, 1 star ,a year ago,Very friendly service. Unfortunately predatory pricing is not a good thing in the current environment. If your waiter suggests a pitcher - suggest you ask the price. $75 is plain ridiculous for a Basic margarita pitcher.
41,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fairly new in the neighborhood (as of 10/2020) but we've been there 4 times already. Limited menu but everything is very good and priced right. Very friendly service. And they have a very nice heated garden in the back
42,Casa del Toro, 2 stars ,2 years ago,This is an example of a chef going to Mexico once and thinking he can make their food. It was sad and expensive. First taco left unfinished in my life maybe. Service is good. That's it. Don't drop $5 on these bland tacos.
43,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Very good tacos and drinks! Definitely coming back!
44,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent atmosphere for dining in the age of covid. Their outdoor courtyard in the back of the restaurant makes you feel like you're actually eating inside of a restaurant. Much nicer feel than being on the sidewalk or in the street.
45,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Hade a great experience after a funeral the food and drinks where excellent and waiters where kind and caring thru our time of grieving
46,Casa del Toro, 1 star ,10 months ago,"PSA: Unacceptably poor fajitas. Do not order if you want to have a fajita. No rice, beans, or cheese. You get 1 giant tortilla on the side. This is a burrito that hasn't been rolled."
47,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great staff and good music! Good food kinda pricey but yummy
48,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious food/drinks, great service, and cute vibe - love the patio. Drinks are typical Manhattan prices, but food is very reasonable especially in Manhattan!"
49,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"The Tacos were so good, this is one of the best places I have eaten at in a long time! The staff were so great and I can't wait to come back!"
50,Casa del Toro, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good tacos, but service was subpar. We were seated in a very dark part of the dining room and had to use our phone flashlights to view the menu. It was like being being part of a search n rescue."
51,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I went there during my holidays, during Halloween, as per my friend’s recommandation. We spend very good time. It is very friendly and good food!! It is important for me, I am French 😄. Thank you to the team!"

53,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So happy to welcome this place to the neighborhood. Wonderful place for a date night, wonderful place to grab a cocktail and the food was delicious. Finally a cute spot to grab food and drinks in the neighborhood with an amazing vibe. Can't wait to go back."
54,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tacos are amazing (especially on tuesdays when they're 3$) and the cocktails are very creative. Definitely recommend the Matador's wife cocktail.

71,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Love the vibe and the service here! If you like spicy cocktails get the Matador’s Mistress - mezcal, pineapple juice, ginger, agave, lime and pink pepper. Food is great too - the guacamole is fresh and everything is full of flavor. Highly recommend!"
72,Casa del Toro, 5 stars ,4 days ago,Hot damn this is the spot! We were in the hood and craving some yummy Mexican - Casa del Toro did not disappoint. From the funky eclectic styling (there’s a guitar on the ceiling above the bar!) to the “just right size” tacos and excellent …
73,Casa del Toro, 4 stars ,a week ago,"The staff was super friendly and courteous. The restaurant was very clean. The bathroom was spot clean and well maintained. My only downside was the food temperature. When I got my tacos, they were barely warm so by the time I got to my …"
