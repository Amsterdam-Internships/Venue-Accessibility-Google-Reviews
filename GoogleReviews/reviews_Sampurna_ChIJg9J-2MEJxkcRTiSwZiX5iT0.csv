1,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a month ago,Liked the food and the ambiance. It‚Äôs a bit pricey but the large food portions make up for it.
2,Sampurna, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"It is really delicious, but quite pricey for the value that you get. The waiters does not explain too much and they are like in hurry. ‚Ä¶"
3,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 months ago,We've had a sharing plates menu for 2 involving multiple samples of dishes. I really liked many of these with beef being particularly delicious. Prices may seem high but the portions are substantial. Staff was very friendly.
4,Sampurna, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Indonesian restaurant. The menus contain a lot of meals. Unfortunately, they are not really tasty, and the prices are expensive. However, the service is excellent. I recommend you to book a table before going there as it is really busy during dinner time."
5,Sampurna, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Very cozy restaurant with pleasant ambience and very good staff. We ordered a shrimp with rice bowl and also shrimp crackers. The food was a about spicy but very tasty. The pricing for the quantity of the food served is justified because of the quality.
6,Sampurna, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Definitely get the sharing platter - it will allow you to taste a variety of different meats and flavours. Dadar gulung is a must as dessert, it is coconut pandan pancakes filled with coconut, palm sugar and pandan leaf."
7,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious chicken & beef skewers, in the centre of Amsterdam. With reasonable Prices"
8,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Excellent rice table!

11,Sampurna, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The best rijsttafel I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam. Friendly service, cute restaurant, and a good location to start your evening. Seems expensive until you see how much food comes out! You will not leave hungry."
12,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Authentic Indonesian food, Rijstafel as tasting menu really to recommend."
13,Sampurna, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I'm Indonesian and this place is a must try! The taste was literally the same as how high quality Indonesian restaurant in Indonesia would be. I'd say it taste like Sate Senayan (if you ever try one in Jakarta). We order the celebes ‚Ä¶
14,Sampurna, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"First time trying indonesian food. Highly recommended, great food and good service."
15,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really great food and indonesian cuisine - comparable to food in indonesia! Nice view of the flower market too.
16,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely cuisine in an excellent location!
I shared a meal for two which contained about 10 dishes to be eaten with rice, I loved much of it and what I didn't like so much my partner enjoyed! ‚Ä¶"
17,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Absolutely fantastic food, great service and a wonderful vibe. Make sure you book as it get busy."

19,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The restaurant was highly recommended in the your books and it did not disappoint. The food is a bit overpriced but tasty, and really authentic. If you want to experience a bit of everything then go for menu for ‚Ç¨23 per person. It has a bit of everything and is very filling. Their house wines are also very good."
20,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent Indonesian restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam. The service (the staff work really hard) was great and the restaurant has a nice vibe to it. The food was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend getting more than you think you ‚Ä¶
21,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We loved this restaurant!!  Great Indonesian food!  Reservation required.   It‚Äôs a very busy place but small enough where you still think you‚Äôre the only ones there.   Had a group of 6 in our party and we couldn‚Äôt finish all the food.
Recommend the spicy menu (it‚Äôs not hot) and I think you‚Äôll love it."
22,Sampurna, 5 stars ,6 months ago,My first time eating Indonesian food and everything was so delicious. The staff was super nice and explained everything to me. Great place to try many sample dishes if it is your first time.
23,Sampurna, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was average, service was poor and ambience was below average.

Food: ‚Ä¶"
24,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic place just off the flower markets. The food here is great. Manageable dishes in tapas style. Very good service and very friendly. First time for Indonesian food so cannot compare but this seemed fantastic and well spiced. Meat was all cooked perfectly.
25,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolute gem of a place! An awesome restaurant for authentic Indonesian food! The quality and taste of most dishes were very similar to that you would find in many restaurants in Jakarta! ‚Ä¶
26,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, great service and even better food! The dining area can get a little bit hot when the weather outside is warm. Although there is outdoor seating, you would be eating right on the sidewalk with people walking past you. The food was excellent; spicy and crunchy. Vegetables were perfectly pickled. You won't be sorry."

28,Sampurna, 1 star ,4 months ago,"If you're looking for bad customer service, this is the place to be!!! Get sent out into the rain to wait, until the waiter finds time for you. Watch him clean tables, take orders and serve drinks, all while getting soaked. Even though ‚Ä¶"
29,Sampurna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and cool place inspired and decorated from the  Indonisian culture. The food was nice and the personel was friendly and happy to explain the menu witch was a little bit confusing. It s an expencive place and the 2 $$ sould be 3 in the google page.
30,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Was looking forward to some great Dutch Indonesian food. Atmosphere was nice and staff friendly. The starters of fried dumpling and chicken soup were good and authentic like the ones we have in South East Asia. ‚Ä¶
31,Sampurna, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good quaint Indonesian restaurant next to the Flower Market. It is busy and reservations are recommended. We had the ""Rice Table"" (Rijsttafel).
My favorite dish: the chicken satay."
32,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very pleasant little restaurant, the food is very unique and very well made. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed. The only thing I would criticize is that the staff could be more attentive, I had to go to the waitress and order the next dish. All in all still a superb experience! üëçüèª"
33,Sampurna, 2 stars ,4 months ago,We had a reservation for 7pm arrived and oh surprise no table available. They made us wait 30 min outside ok they gave us free drinks the least they could do. Then we finally get a table and an hour later still no food on the table. So if you go to the restaurant be prepared to wait and be ignored.
34,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Managed to find us a table evern though they were very busy. Delicious food, all individual small dishes in the 2 person platter. Plenty for the three of us."
35,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Am from Singapore and needed to satisfy some Asian cravings and this really hit the spot. Everything we tried was above expectations. The rendang was above the normal standards as well as the mie Soto and the fried chicken wonton was a winner! Thanks Sampurna
36,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Some of the best Asian food I have ever had!  I have it in many places and this is as authentic as it gets.  This place is well worth stopping if you are a tourist. Very friendly service and pretty quick compared to other places.  Get the sample and you will not be disappointed.
37,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow, what an amazing meal!! Loved the presentation of the many small dishes to share and so many different vibrant flavors.  We ordered the meal pictured to share and then another separate entree. Loved the spicy chicken and beef dishes and ‚Ä¶"
38,Sampurna, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Super tasty rice table, good value, reasonably priced wine, however the service is friendly but not proactive,  it was busy so we were constantly having to catch their eye, but not enough not to go back, as the food was really good"
39,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious indonesian fare. Food portions were adequate and taste was authentic. If you enjoy spicy food, it's a must try! If you dislike spicy food, don't take up space in the restaurant."
40,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the food and the service! The rijstaffel is to die for. Very authentic Indonesian food and they definitely didn't hold back on the spiciness. Try the dessert, Dadar Gulung, too. You won't be disappointed."
41,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"You cannot go to Amsterdam without trying the Indonesian food. The thing to get is the rice table, a bit a everything where a whole group can share. Sampurna had a solo version that was a ton of food, all very delicious. The satay was amazing!"
42,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"As Indonesian, this restaurant has authentic Indonesian food ! Better to book your dinner in advance, lots of people came to the restaurant wanting to eat but rejected since the restaurant was fully booked."
43,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious and authentic Indonesian food. Came here with my husband and friends, they are so satisfied and amazing with the food. The service was so great. Definitely will come back again when we visit Netherlands next time"
44,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I love coming here whenever I'm in Amsterdam. It's a little pricey in comparison to the other rice table options in the city but the service is superb. For a southeast asian missing food with real heat... This is a great place to be. If you ‚Ä¶
45,Sampurna, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I really wanted to get a bite of Indonesian food and this was billed by Google trips as a good spot. I however have to disagree, I got what I would consider their signature dish and while the plating was very nice with a bunch of side ‚Ä¶"
46,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Excellent food and they have the option for you to order multiple small plates that way you can try everything !
47,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for Rijstafel.

Starts with the crispies and about 10 different items to taste. Very delicious ‚Ä¶"
48,Sampurna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,They can get really busy. You MUST make a reservation before hand to save yourself from all the trouble. The food here is really good even though the prices are abit steep. A dinner for 5 cost us around ‚Ç¨200. But it is definitely worth it. ‚Ä¶
49,Sampurna, 1 star ,5 months ago,"The food was tasteless and nothing special. I‚Äôm very disappointed considering the other reviews I saw. Maybe the chef was on holiday. I left most of my food and they still charged me for it.
Disgraceful"
50,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I can‚Äôt say this is the best Indonesian restaurant ever since this was our first time trying Indonesian food but it was a pretty good first experience.

51,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing Indonesian place. Someone else on my table ordered the Rijsttafel and it was delicious! If you like spices and hot sauces this is a great place.
52,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We loved it! perhaps because we ordered simple stuff like the nasi goreng and it was delicious and fast. We have tried other indonesian resto, the price in amsterdam is about the same. Would recommend for those wanting to eat indonesian food."
53,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome Indonesian food and very nice service! The Piring Sate Siang was delicious. Bear in mind that the food is spicy.
54,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"EXCELLENT Indonesian food. Generous, well priced, delicious. Best satay beef of my LIFE - order PIRING SATE SIANG"
55,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very delicious Indonesian food

Especially the rice tafel ‚Ä¶"
56,Sampurna, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Rice table is good option when you visit this place. You can share in lunch time and only charged for one person. If you go dinner time same food you will be charged twice I mean per person. Drinks are real small glass
57,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and loved the food. Rice goreng; green beans with tofu in coconut curry; chicken and beef satays; fish lumpia; extremely spicy chicken curry; spicy samba beef curry; mango and peanut salad. Beer, lots of beer to wash away the heat. Friendly, attentive service as well."
58,Sampurna, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Came to this spot from New York with my Indonesian friend and the food was absolutely phenomenal to us both. Everything from the food to the service completely blew us away. My friend grew up in indo and he said it was the best Indonesian ‚Ä¶

61,Sampurna, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We really enjoyed our meal here. Service was excellent. Highly recommended.
62,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Upscale option for Indonesian, but you‚Äôll pay for it. Above average wine menu and a ‚Äúsolo‚Äù option if you‚Äôre looking for a personal rice table."

68,Sampurna, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Amazing food from Indonesia ! you have to do it absolutely ! the restaurant is really nice also and the service is very good. Just before the flowers market. The bill is very reasonable.
69,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Obviously, being a tourist, I wanted to avoid the tourist places. Not one of the people in here were tourists. All local Dutch! Tasty food and genuine Indonesian food made for an incredible evening. Located directly in front of the flower market, it also provides perfect access to the town, day or night!"

79,Sampurna, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Still open for takeaway (no indoor seating because of Covid19), this is a great place for good, authentic Indonesian cuisine. The vegetarian 'rijsttafel' is a wonderfully varied meat-free menu, with a range of strong flavours. Highly recommended."
80,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great Indonesian tasting experience! Wonderful selections and a friendly, attentive staff."
81,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the food. Was recommended by the tour guide and was worth it. Will recommend to any visiting Amsterdam to try this.

83,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The Fried Duck (Bebek Goreng) with Green Chili was excellent.
84,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing Indonesian rice table -this was one of my favorite meals while on vacation with my daughter. I loved that we could share a great vegan meal and I didn‚Äôt feel I was missing out on anything-the flavors were beyond wonderful. They have several options to choose from so it‚Äôs great for everyone to enjoy.

91,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love this place. The flavors are so incredible and portions are perfect. I wish we had a place like this in San Francisco.
92,Sampurna, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best rice table we have had so far in Amsterdam! Delicious and great variety.
93,Sampurna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good! A new experience for me. Indonesian food was not on my radar before. Similar to Thai food. A little too sweet for me to eat often, bit I would definitely go back. Loved the spicier dishes!"
94,Sampurna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôve visited Sampurna a couple of times for group business meals and we have been very impressed. Rice tables are very good value, with good variety and they can easily cater for vegetarians. Service excellent as well. Location is also good by the flower market."
95,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food presentation was good. Tasty but price wise would be higher than usual indon food you can get around amsterdam
96,Sampurna, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We had an amazing experience with food here, portions were fair and the spiciness level perfectly balanced. The interiors are a nice mix of elegant and exotic, with a subtle light that gives that lazy Asian eatery atmosphere. Five stars so ‚Ä¶"

100,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First time I have ever eaten Indonesian cuisine - have since been to Jakarta, Indonesia and I can safely state that this place is the real deal. Really tasty food, nice variety and really generous portions. Recommend this to anyone who wants to try Indonesian cuisine in Amsterdam."
101,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just loved it. I tried Indonesian food for the first time ever and it took my low/no expectations to next level. The best taste I got during my entire 1 week trip in Amsterdam, situated very close to the flower market, you cannot miss the place if you are around there. Highly recommended."
102,Sampurna, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food was good (presentation & taste). Inside it was very stuffy since it's a tiny space. The service was ok but definitely not more than that. The dishes are very expansive especially for someone from Berlin. I payed 47‚Ç¨ for two dishes ‚Ä¶
103,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best Indonesian food in town!! Service is great as well

105,Sampurna, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Extremely tasty! You can taste high quality meat. Only found it a bit pricey for the size of the dishes..  other than that was fabulous place. Ordering a Tea too was a nice experience with the tray you can choose from.
106,Sampurna, 4 stars ,a year ago,Someone like me who ate Indonesian food for the first time ... I would advise you to steer away if you don't like too much sweet things... And if it's the other way around ... Then you will be in heaven... ‚Ä¶
107,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place to have a quick taste of Indonesia. I had Nasi Goreng and it was yummy. You can have the shrimp chips all you want. Spicy eggs, and peanut sides are a great addition to the meal. Friendly staff make it a pleasant outing."

115,Sampurna, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely restaurant, excellent food with the subtle depth of flavours you expect from great Indonesian food.

117,Sampurna, 1 star ,2 years ago,Really disliked the place. I feel that the cuts of meat were the cheapest and fattiest parts. Food didn't have a lot of flavour apart from spicy or satay. Also noticed that the service was cold and rushed. I noticed some Americans getting ‚Ä¶

121,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Not only the best Indonesian food I have ever eaten. But my ‚Äòdevil chicken‚Äô was perhaps one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Service was fantastic, prices extremely reasonable considering the quality and the restaurant itself was beautiful."
122,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We got one of the dinners for 2. The flavor and variety were amazing. 11 dishes plus rice. So much food we couldnt eat it all!  Satisfied our craving for Indonesian food for sure. Friendly staff too! Sorry the photo isnt of everything...some we finished off!

127,Sampurna, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Awesome dining experience. Our first Indonesian restaurant, we had the suggested rice table menu of many small rather spicy dishes, which we both love. Very pleasant staff and no regrets for the 100 euro meal for two, including wine and ‚Ä¶"
128,Sampurna, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food but poor value for money when travelling on the Australian dollar. The food and service was really good.We had 2 different types of rijsttafel which were devoured by all. Excluding wine the meal for a family of 5 was the equivalent of $300 (australian). That's a lot more than I would pay for Indonesian food in Sydney.

130,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, the food is heavily. ..you can tell it's made with a love and passion for the food that was created, and the presentation is an art form in itself. The staff are so friendly and the service is quick and efficient. One of my favourite places on this planet."
131,Sampurna, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was ok. Some of it was tasty, but most wasn‚Äôt anything special. The rice was hot, but everything else was a bit cold. One of the waitresses wasn‚Äôt too kind. I don‚Äôt think the food/service justified the price tag. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
132,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food was a real paradise, the location is fantastic in the middle of flower market with a view on the street , the service was great and very kind people. If you come to visit Amsterdam don't miss this restaurant"

134,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We tried Sampurna based on someone's recommendation and are very glad we did! I recommend trying one of the three ""sampler"" menus. You get to try a variety of meats, vegetables, and sauces. The flavors are bold and exotic. We enjoyed everything we tried. I think you will, too!"
135,Sampurna, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Rudest service ever.  There are a lot more delicious Indonesian food around without dark faces, rude service and no service.  We booked a table and ordered wine, waiting to order for 15 minutes without any service.  There was one girl ‚Ä¶"

Not too spicy food. Crisp and tasty."
145,Sampurna, 1 star ,2 years ago,The worst restaurant ever. Very slow and not polite at all. We kept waiting on the table almost 1 hour and the waiter not even look and want clean the table. No purpose if the food good but the service very bad. Very sad. We should proud to ‚Ä¶
146,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious Indonesian food, just like my mom makes. I knew the rijsttafel came with several dishes, but I didn't realize there were so many, especially since we ordered 2 different rijsttafel. Everything was very authentic. Only a few of the waiters spoke Indonesian."
147,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely restaurants friendly staff with excellent food selections for all types meat lovers or vegan. We had huge platter, food was amazing hot and tasty."
148,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good variety. Lots of vegetarian options. We all took rijsttafel dishes for sharing. So much good food and different flavored. Dessert are also surprising and interesting. It was a great dinner.
149,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had many good meals, but this was the best.  We had the three course rice and it was spectacular.  The satay was the best I've had. The service was great and I can't wait to go back."
150,Sampurna, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This awesome Indonesian Rijstaffel restaurant has some excellent ambiance and food. Inside is dark and moody, and fairly quiet. Service is great and fairly fast considering the complex dishes they serve up. They even have some good beer ‚Ä¶"
151,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A must-try restaurant in AMS!!! Great Indonesian food ü•ò The staff was lovely too.
152,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best meals I have ever had.  The flavours are amazing and the staff were friendly and attentive.  Highly recommend!
153,Sampurna, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Still one of the best Indonesian food places in town. A bit more upscale than most but worth the money. Try the Sateh Solo. Three different meat skewers, including one made of the, rather posh, fillet steak."
154,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing service for Europe. Excellent food. We had an appetizer, meal, dessert and bottle of wine and were out in under an hour, but were not rushed. Outstanding food and service, from a couple from Texas."
155,Sampurna, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Very good food. When they say spicy, they mean spicy. If you don't like spicy you can get non spicy plates.
It's definitely best to get one of the fixed menus, unless you really know your ‚Ä¶"
156,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty food and great service. Perfect amount of spice, a little kick but not overpowering. We went for a set menu that had a great variety of dishes."
157,Sampurna, 1 star ,2 years ago,Had a horrible experience. Came in to have lunch and was turned away because only 1 waiter was working. Half of the restaurant was empty and many that were seated were done with their meals. The waiter was also rude and confused about what he was doing. Would not return.
158,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"But for the ridiculously high prices, the experience brought my taste buds back to the very best Indo food that Jakarta itself has to offer.  Impeccable sate kambing with real emping crackers. The rendang was tender with very strong ‚Ä¶"
159,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a year ago,Just amazing ! With a lot of flavours üòç I really recommend it !!!
160,Sampurna, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The staff is very friendly and the ambience also feels nice. The food tastes really good, but with the mixed platter coming pre-prepared, 29‚Ç¨ per person is too expensive."
161,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Love the ambience of the place. Tried the nasi goreng and the sides that goes along with it and I must say that the food is genuinely authentic and superb. Yes it is a little pricey but considering this is in the city centre of Amsterdam. It is alright.
162,Sampurna, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"The food was OK albeit somewhat overpriced. However the evening was spoiled by the logistics. Although I made reservation the day before, we had to wait for about 20 minutes upon arrival. Obviously they accept more reservations than they ‚Ä¶"
163,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Highly recommend, taster menus were awesome with 20 different excellent dishes!

164,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 months ago,It was delicious.

166,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"First time I tried Indonesian food, it was delicious! Tender chicken and the sweetness of the sauce was devine. A little too spicy for me but otherwise perfect."
167,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Outstanding Indonesian food. Great fast service. I recommend the taster menu for terrific selection of all dishes. Perfect amount of spice.
168,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very friendly and helpful staff, food was delicious, fast service and overall fantastic experience. Would definitely recommend and cannot wait to come back"
169,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great and excellent Indonesian food. If you don't like spicy food, do not go there because they make almost everything spicy, they do even put chili on woked vegetables.  A pitty to my personal opinion."
170,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent food but RESERVE IN ADVANCE. We learnt this lesson the hard way. The rice-table (Rijsttafel) is a revelation. Every single dish has a distinct and exquisite taste.
171,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best Indonesian meal I‚Äôve had üëåüèº
172,Sampurna, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice place, nice food experience, very friendly staff. We took one of the 'tasting menus' and it was really cool. Most of the dishes were spicy so watch out if you are not a spicy food fan :)"
173,Sampurna, 1 star ,2 years ago,This place was supposed to be authentic - but unfortunately we weren‚Äôt even able to try it out. Arrived around 3:21 with 1 server and multiple empty tables. Among the whole restaurant there were probably only 7 tables that had customers in ‚Ä¶
174,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Sampurna has lovely food, and great staff. They walked us through the menu completely before ordering, and continued to bring food out the entire night! Great authentic Indonesian Cuisine."
175,Sampurna, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very disappointed when I visited for lunch after reading reviews. Ordered cod for main dish which cost nearly 18 euros. What I got was deep fried breaded cod (which is sometimes known as fish fingers!!!). One of the examples for how badly general reviews can be misleading
176,Sampurna, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"We came to this place to try the rijsttafel and ended up ordering a Batala rijsttafel for two. It wasn't cheap, priced at almost 30‚Ç¨ per person, plus a whole 5,5‚Ç¨ for a bottle of water, but the food was good and the way everything was ‚Ä¶"
177,Sampurna, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very pretty decor, kind and professional staff. We ordered two rijstafel (the first and the second on the menu). Food was very salty; beef chewy. Warm salad good."
178,Sampurna, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really good but slow and not so kind service
179,Sampurna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We visited this restaurant at the reccomendation of Mars,  our city guide. The food was delicious,  we'd never tried Indonesian food before. The service was fantastic. Highly recommend."
180,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Can't praise enough, best Indonesian restaurant here in Ams! Great location great location, great food and most importantly great staffs. Excellent service + authentic Indonesian foods = happy customer!"
181,Sampurna, 1 star ,2 years ago,Their food was very overpriced for what we got. The meal was a big disappointment and I don't understand how they charge so much for pretty mediocre food. We didn't even end up finishing all our food because it was so average. The staff ‚Ä¶
182,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very friendly service and super delicious food. We came twice in our three-days-stay.
Will come again! Thank you!"
183,Sampurna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had the Celebes Rijsttafel and it was a great sampling of Indonesian food as seen in the picture.  I like hot food and several of the dishes had a nice slow burn to them.
184,Sampurna, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was great, but expensive and service was poor (not enough wait staff for the crowd).  Also was disappointed that they didn't serve tap water (kraan water) on such a hot day and we had to buy several bottles of water to stay hydrated."
185,Sampurna, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tasty meal we really enjoyed it, cozy atmosphere, good location. A bit overpriced thought. Waiter at the end a bit forced us to tip which spoiled the impression."
186,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great staff, excellent food and great atmosphere. Bit small so reservations may not be a bad idea even though we got in without one around 8 pm the day of the visit."
187,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Outstanding food!!! They have great variety spicy and non spicy - all tasty! Just go with an empty tummy you be glad you did!
188,Sampurna, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Clean contemporary looking place close to the floating flower market with a helpful staff. Wonderful rijsttaffel custom made to suit both vegetarians and carnivores. I ask for my food to be ""mild"" because ""medium"" is too much for me."
189,Sampurna, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It's soo delicious and everything in the bowls taste different, I really enjoy the food there :)!"
190,Sampurna, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A variety of options for rijsttafel and food was good
191,Sampurna, 4 stars ,9 years ago,We called ahead but it wasn't necessary on a Sunday night at 8 pm.  The style here is Javanese Indonesian as there is no pork (Babi) on the menu.  There were three of us so we ordered the Batara Rijsttafel (rice-table) for two people and ‚Ä¶
192,Sampurna, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Pricey and when we got there, only one table at the entrance was available. Not too much space for a romantic dinner! We only checked the menu, waited for 15 mins, but then headed for an italian resturant."
193,Sampurna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing. Just, amazing. Best food around. I had the mixed veggies and my husband had the chicken in balinese sauce. It was perfectly."
194,Sampurna, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Food was great. Portion sizes are large. Most of the employees were lively but one was rude. They also have a great selection of teas.

201,Sampurna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Attention to the client is important here . I was offered kroepoek while waiting for my take out order. It's the small details that count. Food is packed with flavor
202,Sampurna, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great for a casual date. The food is authentic, affordable and well done. The setting is nice and the atmosphere is chilled out, cosy, and somewhat classy. Service is discrete and efficient."
203,Sampurna, 2 stars ,2 years ago,We felt cheated coz we ordered a dish of 23 euros and we're charged 47 euros... Coz 2 of us shared it... So you might want to clear that before ;) food is good but definitely not worth 47 euros !!
