0,Dolce & Gelato, 3 stars ,a year ago,"These churros were definitely on the better end of the spectrum. They were freshly made and I preferred these ones than others I tried while in the city. I think €11 is very expensive, and I live in London so they're definitely over priced. …"
1,Dolce & Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"These guys were super funny and nice to everyone, and made the rainy day better for sure. On top of having  fresh churros made when ordered they were sure to be very clear with sizes and the ordering process (despite the clear inebriation …"
2,Dolce & Gelato, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Fairly expensive, charged me 10€ for the cookies and cream waffle with a gelato ice cream. Ended up being way too sweet since he added chocolate syrup on top of everything 😱"
3,Dolce & Gelato, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing waffles, prices a little steep but I suppose thats because of the location. The staff, however, were not so amazing. There were 2 guys and they both had horrible attitudes towards me and my partner, rushing me to order and shouting …"
4,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,a year ago,Ordered a single Waffel with kinder on top and was charged 8 euros! Also it was preheated and not freshly made. You can find places around city centre where they make fresh Waffel with better taste.
5,Dolce & Gelato, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely delicious crepes! Came here at the end of every night in Amsterdam to get a banana & nutella crepe. Staff were also very happy and friendly, and remembered our order after just the first time!"
6,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,6 months ago,10€ for the worst crepe ever. Poorly made and completely unpractical to eat on feet. Biggest tourist trap in Amsterdam.
7,Dolce & Gelato, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Quick service. However not sure on the flavour of the chocolate waffle I had. The taste and texture was not what I expected  and certainly not a traditional waffle.
8,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,a year ago,"Disgusting! We asked for the banana Crepe, the guy told me they have no bananas. So we got the banana Crepe with just chocolate. Price was 6,5€ instead of 4,5€. Really awkward but ok whatever. And THEN after one bite of the Crepe, it was bad, the dough was rotten and not cooked, so basically rotten raw dough. I almost threw up."
9,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,5 months ago,"8€ for a muffin
Price is not on products and you can't change after order"
10,Dolce & Gelato, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Crepes were delicious and made very carefully and nicely. Staff were very nice. However $32 is astonishing for two crepes and a waffle. Far more expensive than equivalent snacks further down the block. Clientele are late-night revelers, and I'm pretty sure they're preying on said revelers' inebriated faculties!"
11,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Tried to charge 12€ for three churros. I walked away, with them screaming curses at me"
12,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,6 months ago,No visible sign for the prices. It is just a place to rip off people. Rude employees and tasteless food.
13,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Cost us 10 euros each for a waffle and when we were told the price, even his colleague seemed surprised. They were so rude to all the customers in the shop, not just us. They mocked some Asian tourists when they left the shop and also …"
14,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,BAD. Zero stars. Do not come to this place. Charged $11 for a waffle. Such a joke. Bad service. One of the workers even stuck his hand or water bottle in my pocket? Not okay at all. It should be illegal to not have prices listed and then …
15,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very expensive for a teeny tiny scoop! €2.50 for what was like a child's size serving anywhere else. No tasting before purchase; what kind of ice cream shop doesn't offer taste spoons?
16,Dolce & Gelato, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very much over priced in here. We went in to grab a drink and maybe a waffle... ended up spending over 22 euro on 3 items. I couldn't undertand where they got their prices from, but I felt too cheap to query. Good waffles all round but with …"
17,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,Went Tuesday evening and we were charged €11 for each waffle. After buying our waffles we realized something wasn't ok as the 2 men behind the counter whispered between them when we asked them the price. Wednesday decided to confirm if our …
18,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"No price displayed! Cost me 7,5$ for a crepe with only nutella on it... They are stealing money from people! Avoid it! …"
19,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The churros was actually nice, fresh and everything but the feeling of being ripped off is something what stays with you longer than the taste of the food. I didn't check the prices so I was left with a check for 17 Eur, for like 10 …"
20,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I bought a slice of cake and a brownie, the guy on the cash register pretty much stole money from me. I gave him a 20 euro note and he entered 15 in the till, giving me 5 euros back. When I asked him why he did that, he said it's an …"
21,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,"AVOID.
These guys tried to tip themselves multiple times. The greasy guy in the tight top also leaned over and pinched money from me whilst I was counting. They put my …"

23,Dolce & Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very delicious Crepès with very much Toppings for just the right price. Would come here everytime I am here. I recommend it to everyone as a must eat🤤
24,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,4 years ago,This is Tourist trap!!!! Don't go there. They ripping off the people.No visible sign with the prices. 11euros for a small portion churros(fried dough) with Nutella it's astronomic.
25,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,Too pricy. 8 euros for 8 pieces churros. No smaller portions. And too oily I threw most of it. And you can't find prices shown anywhere.
26,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,Just another waffle scam shop. I hope these people will go out of business someday because everyone reads these reviews. Don't ever go there! It's a scam. Prices are invented.

29,Dolce & Gelato, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Fooling with the custumers is simply annoying. Taking your cradit card as a joke is far not funny! The prices are high and not displayed. On the other hand the food is ok.
30,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,Be aware of those scammers! I didt ask for the price before and they charge me 10 euros for a little waffle... was on June 16th 2019 at 9pm
31,Dolce & Gelato, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The Churros were made fresh in front of us and tasted very nice with whipped cream and nutella, staff were very friendly, but the only thing this place lacks is seating as it was raining outside so we had to stand and eat in the corner of the store."
32,Dolce & Gelato, 1 star ,3 years ago,No prices signs and the guy wouldn’t tell us he prices when we asked. (Its overpriced) He took my card to do tap payment and wouldn’t give it back right away. Stay away from this place.
