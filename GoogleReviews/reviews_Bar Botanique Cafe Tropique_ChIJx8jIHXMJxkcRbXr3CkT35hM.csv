0,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Beautiful spot in Oost with absolutely stunning decor and atmosphere. The staff were attentive and friendly and honestly made the whole experience better! Cocktails were tasty, the Negroni was amazing. Only thing is the mojito just had way too much ice."
1,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Beautifully decorated place. We had a nice lunch here, seated in the back in an area that was supposed to be self service, nevertheless, they still served our table (we were not there to work but you can also work in the back of the restaurant). Good coffee, good food. Would recommend this place!"
2,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"It was ok, but as the main dish I ordered some type of tarta ( in the menu it was called Proven√ßal tarte tartine) but I had one grilled red onion with 1 tomato and maybe one dozen of green beans but in the big plate. Sorry but it‚Äôs not the main dish and it‚Äôs not the tartine"
3,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Super cool atmosphere and a great menu but they were unfortunately out of the first several things we wanted to order, including cocktails. Our food (a sandwich and eggs) was good when we got it but took over 45 minutes."
4,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Beautiful interior. Fantastic service. Drinks were a little pricey but it‚Äôs a great place to meet friends. Didn‚Äôt get to try the food.
5,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I loved this place! The people working here were wonderful and very attentive, I had the steak and turned out delicious! Also had copious amounts of cocktails and beers and all of those were great too!"
6,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Breakfast was perfect. We had the red velvet cake, the Croque Madame and the baked Banana Bread. It was so beautiful, that we came back in the evening to enjoy a couple of drinks and a plate of Bittergarnitur."
7,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,4 months ago,This is one of my favorite places in Amsterdam. We are from NYC and picky with the restaurants. This place has amazing food and great great customer service. The ambiance is great. I have been with girlfriends and also with my family which ‚Ä¶

9,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"We made our way to Bar Botanique on a sunny Monday evening. Its located in a very trendy and hip neighborhood in Amsterdam East and is luckily very close to our place. We ordered the sweet potato fries, bitterballen, vegan bitterballen and ‚Ä¶"
10,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The concept is great- tropical feeling is just right here in Amsterdam. Foods and drinks is good. Coffee is quite nice as well. Staffs are friendly. The location is might not be in the tourist spot but I find it is very charming area. I feel like blending in with local. Great to sit outdoor when it‚Äôs nice weathers.

13,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I liked here a lot in my first visit in the morning, when it was really chill and peaceful. So I chose to come again for my birthday dinner this time, on a Thursday (mind you, NOT Friday). It was so, so loud, as in a nightclub, when it was not... The whole night turned out to be a chaotic mess because of that."
14,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Food was mediocre and kinda cold.
Two lovely waiters, but some of the other team members where much less hospitable. A waiter even rolled their eyes at us when walking away.
No wow factor, will not be returning anytime soon."
15,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Tasty food, big portions that won't leave you hungry. We had the Parmesan truffle omelette and a goat cheese sandwich and were very happy with it. Friendly bright ambiance thanks to the many plants and high inlet of daylight"
16,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"I was here a long time ago and I just didn‚Äôt like the attitude of the staff, back then. Coming back now nothing has changed! ‚Ä¶"
17,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice hipster-like place. I went here and got a cappuccino and a vegan toastie. We also tried the chocolate fudge cake and carrot cake. Very cool vibe. I‚Äôve even been here at night once where they hosted a salsa dancing workshop. Good prices and good service as well.

19,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee and cocktails, certainly nice atmosphere. Place full of plants and staff are all friendly. Just a bit too much carrots on the carrot humus bread."
20,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice interior, but tables are a bit too small if you order multiple things, stuff barely fits. Food is good, pizza was nice. Also would recommend a homemade strawberry soda. A bit noisy, so not super cozy. Can also just grab a drink here."
21,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Didn't stay here very long since we were in a rush, but the drinks were nice, and the snacks were fine, albeit a little pricey. ‚Ä¶"
22,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Urban jungle concept with overloaded green. Total hipster but you would love to hang out here. Food is yummy but not impressing. The glasses could be cleaned better. The waiter changed my super dirty glass with a new drink, so service is still good."

24,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Great place and amazing food!!! We loved the place.

26,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Bar Botanique is by far one of the best Cafes I have been to in Amsterdam. The interior is beautiful, the staff super nice and the food.. the food is amazing! My sister and I went for breakfast on a Sunday morning and we loved it. You should definitely go and check it out, it is so worth it!"
27,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place not in crown of the city center. Inside is beautiful and you go mostly to see it. Food is good, they have burgers, salads, sandwiches and breakfast/brunch choices. A bit pricy but worth it."
28,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Greeted by a very friendly server. Nice selection of food, a great place for breakfast. I had the Croque Italien and Scrambled eggs with bacon. Both were delicious; I highly recommend the Croques! The coffee was also quite nice. Interior is decorated nicely and has a chilled vibe. Check this place out!"

31,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cool bar with an inspiring artsy atmosphere.
The food is very tasty and the drinks prepared by professionals.
The negative point was the toilet, a bit dirty and smelly.
Perhaps a pity for a cool place like that."
32,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,a year ago,we had the best service ever in Amsterdam. Jur was helping us at our table and he was extremely nice and. Kindly looked for the wine we asked (they have biological and biodynamic). Food was served quickly. Very satisfied

34,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cool spot in a friendly and eclectic neighborhood. As the name suggests there's a French /botanical vibe going on. Nice beers and good food snacks to be had - we had bitterballen - a must. All the staff were super smiley and helpful.

39,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The prettiest cafe in Amsterdam! The interior design is impeccable. I‚Äôm in love with the chic rainforest vibe. Three levels.

41,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Bar Botanique is located in East Amsterdam.

45,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the interior and tropical vibe. Food quality can be better though. Ordered Croque Madame (9.5 Euro) and A√ßa√≠ Bowl (9.95 Euro), Croque was pretty ok but A√ßa√≠ Bowl was a BIG disappointment: runny consistency (much runnier and thinner ‚Ä¶"
46,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Really cool vibe, the food was very good and the staff were quite friendly. The cocktails are winner too."
47,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Just back from lunch in Botanique. Lovely vibe and decor. Good menu. Loved the Croque Vegetarian. The Veg Toastie on the other hand was okay. Look forward to trying the dinner menu soon. ‚Ä¶
48,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Lovely options for lunch, whether you're looking for a snack, something sweet or a full meal.

49,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Nice place to hang out with the friends. Good service, good drinks."
50,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 1 star ,5 months ago,It's very nice restaurant but we were waiting for someone to take order like 30 minutes but no one come. So we decided to walk out.

53,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Celebrated my wife's birthday with a bunch of friends.. they made it memorable. Also it was surprisingly quite affordable with the pitchers.
54,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Food and drinks are good but had an issue with the bill - The server charged us twice the amount for an appetizer showing P.P and did not let us know in the beginning it is served for two people, upon complaining she said we cant do ‚Ä¶"

56,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This bar is one of the nicest in the eastern part of Amsterdam. Great decoration, good food (which isn‚Äôt overly expensive), fine wines and tasty cocktails. I would definitely recommend going there and to try the GT orange cinnamon."

If I'm ever in Amsterdam again, I will definitely visit for the amazing food !"
65,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is definitely one of the best brunch spot in Amsterdam Oost. Love the jungle kind of atmosphere and the reactive (not usual over here) and friendly staff.
66,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Drinks and food are tasty and it‚Äôs a very nice place even with radiant heaters outside, but we had to wait almost 1,5 hours for our meals. Additionally my pizza magherita was almost cold, when I got it. However, the taste was good. ‚Ä¶"
67,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Friendly staff, but bad price-quality ratio. The falafel burger was really dry and overall not appetising at all"

76,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Best bar in Amsterdam. I‚Äôm actually their neighbour. They are the most sociable bunch of people I know and the interior is something to behold.
77,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I really love the food their, and the decoration is really nice. In addition, the staff is usually really invested and helpful. Unfortunately, for me the music is just too loud which makes it difficult to have a nice conversation. I would enjoy this place a lot more with a quiet atmosphere."
78,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Visited this beautiful place for the 1st time last week. I planned a dinner for my GF's birthday. The place looks very nice and cosy and the service is great! The staff is super friendly, helpful and are really trying to give you the best ‚Ä¶"

80,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, and atmosphere! The waitress with the curly hair was lovely. We were with a big group and she was a perfect host. Even after we ordered 12+ Espresso Martinis in one go!  Deffo a go-to if you like botanic, Caribbean vibes and good food!"
81,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My favorite neighborhood ""grand cafe"", no matter if you need breakfast, lunch, simple dinner, just a cup of coffee or want to enjoy some local beers. This is just a good place to take a break from the busy neighborhood. Friendly staff, and lovely green scenery."

86,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 1 star ,a year ago,"I visited yesterday with my girlfriend for the 5th time and was again shocked at how lazy the staff was. We waited 20 minutes to order (not outside) and the staff was going around without looking at us. There are better places to visit in Amsterdam with much more creative plates, better ambience and most importantly professional staff."
87,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, extensive drinks list and so many plants! It's quite a big restaurant but because of the different levels you don't really notice, and good thing is that there always seems to be a table free! Great place to go for brunch, dinner of drinks."
88,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 1 star ,a year ago,"Came back to change my review from 4 to 1. Came here 4-5 times in the past year and although the service was extremely slow, at least I enjoyed the beautiful interior. Unfortunately, a pretty decoration is not enough to keep me coming back. ‚Ä¶"

93,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Located a little from the centre, it seemee popular with the locals, very chilled out vibe and well priced. Fortunately it seems to have escaped the whole Instagrammer pretentiousness thing for the time being"
94,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Was pleasantly surprised by excellent service and great food! Staff were friendly and polite and made us feel welcome
95,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good, coffee was like warm bath water, maybe it a European thing to make coffee that's just above cold! Interesting concept. Service was good, just absolutely avoid the Asian girl at the bar at all costs, I won't go into detail, you've been warned.. terrible.. should absolutely not be in the service industry."
96,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, service was excellent for example, the moment our water glasses were almost empty there was a employee refiling it. Orders were fast, several options of alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails, wine suggestions for each ‚Ä¶"
97,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cafe, with high ceiling and lots of vegetation! Good coffee, limited menu selection."
98,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Ambiance is nice. But food was not the best. Maybe because we were a group and had limited options. Bavette was delicious. Risotto was not cheesy enough. Fish and mussel dish was blend and could use more flavours. Service was good. I would still go back to try again without a group setting.
99,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Gorgeous place (inside and outside) with friendly staff and a great beer selection.
100,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved the music, wine and atmosphere. Very friendly staff!
4 stars because my vega burger was as dry that I could barely cut it. So I'd say it's a good place for drinks"
101,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I celebrated my birthday at Botanique, we were around 20 people. The booking process for a table went was very smooth, I received a lot of details in a nice and fast way. The service was good, drinks and food lekker :) There was a tiny ‚Ä¶"
102,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was a dissapointment. The pizza was average, i didn't really like the dough. More cheese and more toppings would make a huge difference. We also had the beetroot salad, which was tasty but too sour. However, it's a really nice place with good service."
103,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Popular hip place
Many yup's go here on a Friday.
The music is pretty loud and service nice and quick. ‚Ä¶"
104,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"4 stars because of price, which was just a little high, and service seemed a little stressed. Food was very good, nice mixture of salads and main courses. Excellent pizzas for kids (adult sizes only so one is enough to share). Steak Frites with  chard was lovely. Good choice of vegetarian as well."
105,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good colour scheme, botanical vibes and good cocktails.
Service varies, one waitress was rude and one waitress was lovely.
Food was average and not worth the price."
106,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely place! Okay staff. Toilets not very clean. My friend liked the lunch but thought more spices could be used to get more taste. I on the other hand thought it was good the way it is but the gold drink was not good. Expensive lunch
107,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is really nice and I love the tropical decoration with all the palm trees.
The food is also excellent. I tasted the pizza and a fish with vegetables. ‚Ä¶"
108,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Everything was perfect ! Great food, drink, music and service ! What more can you ask for ?"
109,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice atmosphere and location. It is a little bit overpriced in my opinion, however."
110,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"A bar that looks nice on pictures and disappointing in real life. The furniture are worn out and the couches look so dirty. The whole place, actually, has a dirty feeling to it as if they put all the effort right in the beginning of making ‚Ä¶"
111,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is beatiful, service was good and the food was delicious. The pizza was well baked and tasty and good sized. The prices were moderate ,  I spent 21.50 on the pizza and three glasses of wine. Well, moderate to the high side if you live in a student budget like I do. I consider it my fancy meal of the week :)"
112,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good cafe, nice atmosphere. Can be very crowded during weekend"
113,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The location is really nice, full of plants! Food is good, coffee can be improved but I recommend it in general üôÇ If you are looking for a place to work from, they have a dedicated area with 2 person tables and plugs üîå"
114,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place with Jungle feeling and delicious Sangria!
115,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was tasty and good service. Few remarks though:
Our reserved table for three was way too small, they brought our main courses before we finished the precourse for some reason and honestly the price is a little too high for the portion sizes and the type of food."
116,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I love the design of this place. The moment you enter you feel like you are in a tropical forest.
Prices are moderate and the staff are kind. ‚Ä¶"
117,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a nice brunch here on a weekend in Amsterdam.  It was a nice walk to the restaurant from city center and it felt nice to get away from the crowds and experience a less touristy area. The food, drinks and service were all great. I would definitely recommend this place!"
118,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice location! Good drinks, very good quality food (especially vegetarian, I love it) and lovely people! And of course people like the decoration, flowers, etc"
119,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good looking place, good vibes definitely but food is definitely not there. The pizza was dry and chewy and the fake smell of truffle coming out of one of the dishes made me a bit sick."
120,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great place to grab a bite or cocktail, especially during spring/summer. Everything's fairly priced and of good quality and they have these extremely fun social gatherings/dance nights for those who love salsa!"
121,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love the interior. The staff was really nice and gave me great advice on the drinks.
122,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice bar to go for a cocktail. The deco reminds you of a tropical place. It has a terrace, kitchen closes at 10 and the bar stays open until 3am. If you like Moscow Mule, try the Dutch Mule! Delicious"
123,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Sometimes, pretty slow service, looking over your head while standing having a chat, but when they come it's friendly."
124,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere but overpriced drinks. Cocktails didn‚Äôt have any punch nor enough alcohol. Mediocre wines at high prices, probably opened for ages..."
125,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice soroundings and great service. Cocktails were so-and-so, but good and okay priced. Didn't try any food, but the dishes I saw looked great."
126,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, friendly service, great cocktails and coffee. Sad though, they took the coconutmilk off the menu. Also a great place for breakfast!"
127,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love the mood of this place. They also have a nice selection of draft beers. I would not recommend cocktails, I think they need to improve quite a bit in this direction. It can be very crowded on weekend nights, but that's also one reason why you might like to go there!"
128,Bar Botanique Cafe Tropique, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a cool place !!!   What deco and atmosphere, feels like a mini-jungle in there :-)
The people working there are very nice & welcoming, service is top !! ‚Ä¶"
