0,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I had simply an amazing time celebrating my son's best friend wedding. Outstanding service from staff. The bartender on hand served top notch cocktails.
1,SkyLounge, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Never made it to the actual sky lounge I was told to wait 20 minutes for the elevator due to some difficulties. Then was told the elevator was being shut down. Had drinks at the bar instead. The bartender was nice, but I was disappointed about the lounge."
2,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,Cute rooftop bar but not very big. You definitely want to get there around 8ish to get a seat if you're going on a Friday or Saturday night.
3,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"All in all it's an interesting place to go for a drink. The view is sensational and the people are more to the upscale side. The service does a good job whenever they can get to you (or you to them), but the space is limited and getting a …"

6,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best view of the city. Great clean atmosphere with nice drinks. The live music was very good.
I was bit disappointed with the days selection of songs though. Country songs."
7,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing views. Expect a $5 cover and drinks are a little pricey but you can't beat the view or the live music.
8,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The SkyLounge was the perfect location to host my husband’s promotion ceremony. Aside from providing the most beautiful backdrop and view of Atlanta, the staff was amazing in every way. Lauren was extremely responsive to all of my emails, …"
9,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Love love love this rooftop right in the heart of downtown.. opens at 6PM.. we had to pay $5 cover charge since there was live music this Friday evening.. the views uptop are really nice and they have nice patio seating outdoors to enjoy …
10,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,a month ago,Amazing space and the two ladies one with blue hair and the other behind the bar were so friendly and kind. Lauren on the other hand. Keeping the review positive though.
11,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Such a beautiful space with a spectacular view of the city of ATL, more particularly the CNN & Mercedes Benz stadium buildings. The food is scrumptious, mouth savoring. The staff was courteous and helpful. Servers were present and visible. Overall Great ambiance and a nice place to have a special intimate events"
12,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice view, however it might be a stretch to consider it in the top rooftop lounges across the country... …"
13,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We meet friends for a birthday dinner at The Glen Hotel , order their Bourbon Wings, they were Amazing! they had a old Renaissance vibe near the bar. Then we went up to Skylouge, they only accept cash to go up. but the view was …"
14,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice atmosphere and good vibes. There was a musician there so that added a really nice touch. The bartender was fast and upbeat. Nice place to have drinks and mingle with friends. There was a $5 cover charge. First come, first serve basis. …"

16,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Walked in around 7pm and it was $5 cover to get in. Once on the rooftop don't expect the waitress to come to you ...after waiting 45 minutes for table service I finnaly got up and walked to the bar and ordered then walked back to my table. …
17,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I've been here many times before for New Year's Eve.  I would consider it a prime spot as it's close enough to see the fireworks at midnight but not directly in the crowd for the Peach drop. …
18,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Superior experience. I went there for a private event. The service staff was superb. The appetizers were pork sliders (didn't eat), bbq mini wings, beef skewers, tomato bruschetta, tomato caprese,  and mini crab cakes (didn't eat). The bartender accommodated me because I don't drink alcohol. The views were spectacular!"
19,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Great space located on top of the Glenn Hotel. Went for a private event and it was amazing!
20,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Great view and good drinks. The price could be better at the bar, the music could use more effort (especially on a Saturday) and charging a cover takes away from money that could be spent at the bar."
21,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Comfortable atmosphere for lounging with a glass of wine, music and being present with life. Amazing bartenders. They turned the heat on for me when I was cold. The view is inspirational. Great for sharing by yourself or with another …"
22,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Roof top lounge with a great food and drink menu. The views on the open patio are wonderful. This is a great event space for an intimate gathering.
23,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I attended a private business function. All I can say is   WOW !! The property is Beautiful, the staff is 4 star.. had a great experience..."
24,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great view, but no AC in summer. I assume they expect the breeze and the fans to suffice, but last time was a bit hot. I know it is expected to be an open space, but at least the bar area could use AC."
25,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great few of Atlanta.  Olympic park  and of course the Falcons stadium. Yummy drinks. Try the centennial. Service was awesome. Appetizers size allows for sharing. Prices about what you would expect.
26,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful location, decor, vibes and views. I stopped by on a Saturday night with my husband to enjoy some alone time. It is a very nice spot to have some drinks and enjoy each other's company.  The only complaints are limited seating, poor …"
27,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The views were wonderful but there aren't enough chairs and tables to go around.   However,  another plus is that even though the drinks are a little on the pricey side they are really poured like doubles."
28,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great spot to just soak in the city. Attended a baby shower here and everything was just perfect! Staff was nice and attentive!
29,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great Date night. You can view downtown it's sooo beautiful. Not a place for full plate dinner they only have small appetizers but they definitely have a bar with great selections. Definitely recommend
30,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great place for drinks and live entertainment. No food service in the lounge though at this time... friendly bartenders and great view of ATL.
31,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Pretty great experience! The drinks are reasonable considering the stellar view.
32,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came with friends on a weeknight. I don’t drink so I didn’t buy anything but the view was beautiful. Nice place to chat and hang out. The menu is very basic. Just regular drinks and no food (at least when I went...it was very slow so this might be different when it’s more busy)
33,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice view of the city. Meagre cover charge of $4. Food appetizers selections are limited. No entrees. Drinks are reasonably priced.
34,SkyLounge, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Great views and close proximity to MBenz and State Farm Arena make it a plus. Understaffed bar= slow service. Lack of fans to cool you off while waiting 29 mins for a beer made it worse. And at 11pm, they close early in the week. Way too early."
35,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Food was great, drinks were smooth and the staff was attentive!  Great views!"
36,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A really nice view of downtown Atlanta. Roof Top that is open. Ok wine and beer selection.
37,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great place for a date night. I love the drinks and views
38,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing view of the city! A must stop when in the area. Limited appetizer menu and bar service was slow. Kinda hidden so little confusing to find. But worth the hunt
39,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Kind of expensive restaurant but worth it, wonderful view!!! Highly recommended!"
40,SkyLounge, 1 star ,a year ago,"Hello beautiful ppl, I have to do this post so it's out there. I went to this establishment lastnight trying to book a birthday party, bartenders and the one manager made me feel so welcome. I had decided to have my party there, I just …"
41,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went for some early evening drinks on a warm Saturday. Awesome views, awesome drinks and a nice charcuterie board to snack on.  Highly recommended for something fun and different!"
42,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite rooftop bars in the downtown area! Great views & atmosphere!
43,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing view of Atlanta skyline, would love to see a few more small bite options on the menu."
44,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,a month ago,Amazing experience! The food was great! Love the atmosphere !!!
45,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great event place i was having a little too much fun.. Bartender was moody but that didn't stop us!!! Nice rooftop.
46,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful views with a relaxed vibe. The crowd has energy and is younger, but it doesn't feel ""exclusive"" to any age group. We went in the winter and they keep it very warm while still allowing you to see the beautiful views. Additionally, drink prices are very reasonable for such a beautiful location."
47,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,a year ago,This is my favorite rooftop in the city.  Because it sits adjacent to Centennial Park there are no obstructions for a great distance.  You have a great view of the Atlanta skyline while being a part of it.   There's usually someone playing …
48,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"My favorite place to chill, get a good drink and enjoy amazing views of the city"
49,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a cool place to visit for a first timer in Atlanta. They have an amazing view, live music and couches. They also have heating lamps. My only complaint is that the beer selection was less than great. Overall worth a visit, but I wasn't compelled to stay very long."
50,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Not so bad. Ambience isnt that great, less seating capacity. Had to wait for a while to get seated. Drinks arent that good either! Customer service was great!"
51,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice rooftop - beautiful views. LIVE MUSIC!!
$5 cover even for girls, okay crowd"
52,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It wasn't what I expected but maybe the experience would be better in warmer weather. To me it was more like upstairs than upscale and was extremely casual. The cover charge of $5 was fair but a band would be nice. There were only a few patrons when we went. The bartender was personable and his drinks were awesome.
53,SkyLounge, 1 star ,8 months ago,Not a very welcoming place at all.  I wanted to host an event there with a visit to the Rooftop lounge.  The Bouncer in the lobby put a stop to that with no remorse and a charge to boot.  No open dialogue to speak with a manager or anything.  That is unacceptable in my arena and clientele.
54,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Jay and Brian were great! The staff in general are friendly and the views are fantastic. I think this spot would be amazing in the summer months, not too bad in the colder months - makeshift cover made it nice to be outside if you wanted to …"
55,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"The views are unmatched and the live music was great, but in general the overall vibe and clientale was not what I expected. Also, the drinks and service were quite average."
56,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great event location.  Check them out for nice evening or special event
57,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice view for 3/4 of the rooftop. But not great, and not worth the $5 cover. Very loud live music - couldn't hear my wife standing beside me. Free water available, otherwise $10+ (normal for area). Was crowded and not a large area. Felt better in the downstairs lounge!"
58,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Very great place, night life, the view is amazing, well decorated, live music, good music, clean, good service, friendly, pay cover at night, there is a parking lot beside the building, they have some snacks, you can see the most important city building and night city lights. We will come back."
59,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great views and atmosphere. I would recommended to everyone to visit this rooftop bar
60,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great drinks, small bites where delicious.. the place had live music and also playing sports channels in the TV for the sports lovers.
Above all this place had best roof top view of the downtown for great pictures"
61,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to sit and have a drink. The view is what make it memorable though.
62,SkyLounge, 1 star ,a year ago,I will explain why I gave the Sky Lounge one star....... it was extremely boring!!!! If you are looking for a relaxed environment with barely any seating then this is your spot. The entertainment was a local artist and she was struggling! I quickly left and will not be back!!!!
63,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place to relax and enjoy a cocktail after work!
64,SkyLounge, 1 star ,9 months ago,"So overrated! The view is not even that nice. Pictures on website make it look soo much better and spacious than it actually is. It gets pretty crowded. It's first come, first serve, so good luck."
65,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Good cocktails and great view with excellent live music
66,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I am a Celebrity Photographer out here in Atlanta and we had a red carpet event last night! The staff is really awesome and I recommend going to Skylounge!
67,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Went to Skylounge with coworkers to have a team building event and discuss highlights from the previous year. Atmosphere was pretty good, plenty of seating, and the views of downtown ATL were great. I liked that it was mostly covered and …"
68,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best rooftop view of the city hands down.  Relaxed spot.  Great spot to bring coworkers.
69,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Views. Cannot. Be. Beat.  This is one of the best locations in Atlanta to 'city view'.  The building is only like 10 stories tall, but you get the open air view of Centennial Park and most of downtown.  The staff were friendly and the …"
70,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The sky lounge was great. The atmosphere was exactly what I was looking for. Very casual yet sophisticated. I ordered a double bourbon with a splash of ginger. I felt like the drinks were poured well (not light on liquor). I had to go to …
71,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice place to have a drink with a view. I went right after a game at MBS so the crowd was pretty thick. Waiting in line wasn't that awesome but the breeze on the roof was nice. Notice, I've said nice twice. Because that's exactly what it is: nice."
72,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice wine down spot. Atmosphere is very inviting. Drinks was decent.  Can get a bit crowded. Not alot of seating but people come and go. Seats do come available throughout the night.  4 stars because of seating and no food menu. But overall nice.
73,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great views simple drinks low key and chill
74,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,11 months ago,"It was okay. It can get pretty crowded since it's first come, first serve. Also not recommended for large parties. Nice views of the city from the balcony."
75,SkyLounge, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I arrived at the hotel and immediately, the valet staff was extremely nice, welcoming, and informative. I came to celebrate a one year anniversary with my girlfriend to enjoy the rooftop view. However, our time there was ruined due to one …"
76,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want to enjoy your drinks and a great view of downtown Atlanta, go to SkyLounge. I love this place and i will definitely go back, it gets packed because I guess a lot of people love the view but it's worth it. I suggest going at …"
77,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,a year ago,It was nice and elegant but to charge $5.00 per person as cover charge was unexpected. It's a small quaint bar lounge with live music. The view is nice
78,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,View is amazing and a nice place to bring a date
79,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The view was amazing, and the quick eats were great. The service was terrible, however. I rarely complain about service as I spent years serving. It was later in the afternoon and not busy. The two bartenders blatantly ignored me as I stood …"
80,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great rooftop bar, amazing views"
81,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,11 months ago,Get there early if you want to sit. It was a pretty laid back vibe. Live music and cool atmosphere.
82,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Had a great time! Great ambiance and laid back environment. The view was great!
83,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best view of the city. Surprisingly not many Atlantans know about this spot.
84,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice view of the city. However, drinks were overpriced, considering we were hotel guests. They do not cut their guests any kind of reasonable slack pricewise, considering how much they charge per night."
85,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome roof top bar with nice view of Atlanta Downtown! Superb service and amazing environment. 4 stars because I fel like the space is manageable and it could be a lot better.
86,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had out both in town and out of town guest stay the Glee Hotel. Great experience. Marshall at the front seat was incredible. He watched over every aspect of the comfort of our guest
87,SkyLounge, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, and that's about it.  Service was slow.  Had to hunt down a waitress to attend to our table. The musician was so-so.  To top it off there were huge bugs; resembling big roaches.  We killed 2, but that did not stop the …"
88,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a fun spot on a summer night. Live music, amazing city views, good drinks. They could use another bar just because it can get crowded but it's absolutely worth it and no wonder it's so popular"
89,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful rooftop views of the city skyline.  Only a $5 cover but they need better music. The acoustic guitarist seemed rather basic for the vibe they are trying to create.
90,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great atmosphere. Great space. The bartender (Angel) isn't the nicest but you can look past that after a few drinks!
91,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere. Real laid back. Gorgeous view! Casual attire is appropriate. Great for an after work, don't feel like getting dressed up, relaxed crowd type of place."
92,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As always was a great place if caught at the RIGHT time which I always seem to with my fiancee. Have a drink with a great view.
Awesome addition to our 3yr Anniversary last night."
93,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really laid back spot. Had live music, chill crowd, & great views of downtown. Would definitely recommend for an adult night out. Definitely an intimate location for close friends and lovers. Great for a date."
94,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice place for a drink and watch sunset.
95,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I attended Skylounge this past Saturday with a close friend . I honestly enjoyed my time here ! It was a very chill experience, I enjoyed the jazz music & the live singer was great ! The reason I’m giving four stars is because they ran out …"
96,SkyLounge, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Great view. But otherwise terrible, may your crops whither and children bare no seed. Drinks taste like wet, leftover oatmeal and there are about three seats and an unbalanced table. I was extremely disappointed by this place."
97,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great view of the city and even on Memorial Day Weekend wasn't too crowded. Drinks are pricey but quality. Great view at night as well as during the day
98,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"View - check
Music - check
Place was the schnizzle yo"
99,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great views of Centennial Park, Mercedes Benz Stadium, and the rest of ATL."
100,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The view was spectacular, but the drinks certainly did not live up to it. More crafty cocktails and more experienced bartenders would make this place more desirable."
101,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wanted to come here from a long time. Excellent service to accompany excellent food. You get to choose a range of options to put on your plate. Best in the area. Great atmosphere, super friendly staff. Definitely recommend if you are in this area. The staff is wonderful and the prices are reasonable"
102,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"I must start off by saying Sky Lounge was not what I expected at all! I guess when I hear the word Lounge I picture a DJ, a dance floor, and a food menu. When entering Sky lounge I was greeted by a spectacular Atlanta view, but a small …"
103,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Amazing location and views of the city with a relaxing cocktail. Great bar and atmosphere
104,SkyLounge, 1 star ,3 years ago,Does not look like the picture. Now I know why they want $5 entrance fee. That's how they make money. People pay and go up. Then right back down. Just like me and my wife. Even with the loud fans that will blow your hair off. We were gonna …
105,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A really great roof top bar experience. Great drinks and the views are the best in the city. You won't be disappointed. Nice staff too.
106,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Offering what are the best views in Atlanta, this loans is small but cool. There is sometimes a $5 cover charge, and one time they try to charge me $20 cover, so I was not thrilled about that, but I still love the view."
107,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great rooftop bar in the center of downtown, can't beat it."
108,SkyLounge, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I am dumbfounded by the dress code at this ""restaurant"". No hats, but you can wear strappy tops, flip flops, shorts, basically anything you'd like accept a hat. All the receive a less than mediocre drink at a high price. There is hardly any …"
109,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place; slightly elevated prices, but it's a rooftop in Atlanta so it's worth it; great view; came on a Friday at 9:30 and there was a light crowd. Recommend highly."
110,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The view is amazing and the drinks were good.  This lounge was a selling point of deciding to stay at the Glenn Hotel.  Knocking off a star because it could have used more seating and a little sprucing up, the atmosphere was just ok."
111,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice view! Good bar selections. Drinks are a little pricey but normal for a nice boutique hotel. Best spot for drinks and ambience in this area of downtown.
112,SkyLounge, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We paid 10 to get in and it was so NOT entertaining. I don't know if we came on the wrong night or what but it was DEAD!  We sat down and no one took our drink order(yes, someone was walking around but she did take another couples order)so …"
113,SkyLounge, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I went there to check the place out for an event and have a drink.  Sign and hotel says it is open until 10 on Sunday, however I went up there and at 8:53pm Sunday and at the bar they said they already had last call due to a slow night. …"
114,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,7 years ago,The SkyLounge is hands down one of my favorite places in Atlanta! It's great for date night or to gather with friends after work. The ambiance is always nice & the drinks are good and not too pricey. Call ahead however as sometimes it is closed for private parties.
115,SkyLounge, 1 star ,3 years ago,Valet was being shady in our car (didn’t park was sitting in it pushing buttons). Everyone appears like they don’t want to be at work. Menu showed one price for my wine and when the check came it was more so when I mentioned it the …
116,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,a year ago,Atmosphere was very nice. There was a $5 cover charge the day I went. Which was a Saturday night.
117,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great view.. No table servers but was able to get serviced at the bar quickly
118,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Gorgeous view, reasonable drink prices ($6 beer, $13 LIT), and a relaxed atmosphere are exactly what I needed after a day of intensive training at the conference center nearby. No food, mostly standing room."
119,SkyLounge, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Skylounge is located in glenn hotel.1st time going to sky lounge,probably the last too. Be ready to wait in line and pay $5 cover charge just to get on the elevator to skylounge. The place has no ac, which makes it too hot. Drinks are overpriced and music is nonexistent. The only good thing from skylounge is the view."
120,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Breathtaking views of downtown Atlanta. Great crowd, not too many people. Attentive staff. Not overly priced drinks. An unexpected $5 cover. Still not bad."
121,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Meh. $15 to park; $5/head for the elevator. Not enough places to sit. $10 beer. Nice view. Can you say tourist trap?!!?
122,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place and good drinks.
123,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome rooftop bar with great views.  Good drinks, bartenders, and small plates. Prices are what youd expect for a place downtown, not unreasonable."
124,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is a rooftop bar on the top of the Glenn Hotel. It overlooks downtown Atlanta. The Skyview ferris wheel is next it. The bartenders are friendly. The Skylounge Sour is great. They have sweeter signature drinks and a full bar.
125,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great drinks and environment, the staff is friendly as well!"
126,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow! The view is great up there...the drinks are well priced. Great place for first dates, anniversaries,  or to hang out."

I have been there and never waited to enter. Lol.
It worth a Visit... The staff was Very Nice Also😍"
128,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,10 months ago,The view is amazing up here.
129,SkyLounge, 1 star ,2 years ago,Went there to see the amazing sky line views... Website said they closed at 1am. It was midnight Friday night and they were closed.  I'd advise a call before you go.... cost us 40 plus dollars to Uber there for an upset.
130,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Wonderful service, good food, attentive.  We enjoyed my babygirls 30th birthday."
131,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,11 months ago,Amazing views and atmosphere. The drinks are amazing . The food is not good.

137,SkyLounge, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Decor was very nice scenic view great, but the bartenders and security very bad attitude. Ask for manager never saw one drinks wasn't that good. Kept saying DJ was going to return we got there by 11:00 11:30 never saw a DJ Rush's us out @  1 a.m. . I'll never go again"

142,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I'd like to start out by saying this isn't a place you go for dinner. It's not somewhere you go to party (you could) and it's not Somewhere you go hard on the weekends. This is a magic place, with wonderful views of the city skyline. You …"

144,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Okayish place with very limited drinks. The view is nice but it somehow felt like an incomplete experience. music was boring.

146,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing view of downtown especially at night, live music and good cocktails. Best downtown experience, if you are in Georgia you should definitely stop by"

149,SkyLounge, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Not enough variety on types of drinks to order the extreme air from  the fans excessive and annoying blowing hair all over also making it cold and uncomfortable   wish there was better mixture of  music overall the view was beautiful  and the experience was worth it glad I we went
150,SkyLounge, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful location. I had a bad experience with a bar tender towards the end, she grew impatient, mostly our fault. But all in all a fun place to hangout."
151,SkyLounge, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely the most awesome bar I've been to in a decade. Amazing views of the cityscape and Falcons stadium!
152,SkyLounge, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Small beer selection, and cover charge on Friday nights make this a three stars place but the view from the rooftop is sweet overlooking the ferris wheel."

160,SkyLounge, 1 star ,3 years ago,We couldn't make it to the bar because they charge a cover. And they wouldn't take the cover charge off the exorbitant cost of their drinks if we did go up to the bar. Just not worth it to go up.
161,SkyLounge, 2 stars ,a year ago,Very Small. Pictures look way better and it's hard to believe that this is the famous sky lounge.
