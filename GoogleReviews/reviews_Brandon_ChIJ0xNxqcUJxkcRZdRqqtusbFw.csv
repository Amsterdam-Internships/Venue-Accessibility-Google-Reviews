1,Brandon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Lovely bar with super cool tribal techno playing DJs. Friendly crowd. Will defo come back üòç
2,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great spot, full of character and lovely beers. Well worth a stop off, it will put a smile on  your face!"
3,Brandon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great little pub. Beer only and no got drinks like coffee. The Hertog Jan is a great pilsner. Good spot to stop and people watch for a break.
4,Brandon, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Bit small, super crowded amazing historic venue"
5,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice beer. The oldest bar in the city.
6,Brandon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Canty & chirpy, cosy & cool bar. Recommend to combine wirh a pizza next door."
7,Brandon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place for a beer. Quite busy on Friday nights.. but for sure very popular with locals.
8,Brandon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy locals bar with a long history. Good place to pop into for a beer or two. They don't serve food but there's a good pizza place next door and an awesome frits and snack place one canal over. The staff is nice and the regular crowd is friendly.
9,Brandon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cool vibes, nice personnel and the DJ in the middle of the bar really adds to the awesomeness."
10,Brandon, 2 stars ,a year ago,"A typical dutch brown bar. Dirty (they will serve you ice with the hands), interesting interior, awful-and-not-friendly service but hey... full of locals having fun. So either join that concept or leave. ‚Ä¶"
11,Brandon, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Fabulous place. Glan the bartender is the coolest ever
12,Brandon, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very small, which could add to the charm. But the place seemed a little dirty, all the tables had some crumbs/dirt on them. The glasses were clean, but the prices were quite high for what I was expecting. ‚Ä¶"
13,Brandon, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Friendly staff, good beer options and good qualities, a good view‚Ä¶ what do you want more from a bar ?"
14,Brandon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Terrace (mostly standing) with a lot of sun in the summer time. Reasonable selection of beers, mixed crowd. Lot of business people gather up for after work drinks on Thursdays and Fridays. Big smoking room inside so if you're not in to that ‚Ä¶"
15,Brandon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very nice bar with unique interior.
16,Brandon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Had beers on the canal at this place and really great chill atmosphere
17,Brandon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Remains a classic under the bars in Amsterdam. Especially in the summer has a lot of sunlight so perfect place to have your beer in the sun. Interior remains outdated as ever but has become somewhat of a guilty pleasure by now for most the people I know.
18,Brandon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Highly recommended to visit Amsterdam's oldest pub. Amazing find meeting some lovely friendly locals on a lazy Friday afternoon. After stopping for 'one drink' at 7pm we left after 10.30pm having been shouted many drinks from our new local friends.
19,Brandon, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice atmosphere
, but barkeepers not friendly at all"
20,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Bar, great vibe!"
21,Brandon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's the perfect pit stop when bar hopping around. First get your head right ""outside"" then grab a brew at the bar and go sit on the movie theatre chairs in the cool and eclectic lounge room. Oh your welcome!"
22,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Not just your typical Amsterdam brown bar. Absolute local hang and 100% one of the best spots to spend some time by yourself or with others over a few drinks and something very delicious from their menu. Plus it‚Äôs in the heart of the Jordaan.
23,Brandon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff, cool interior. Nice beers"
24,Brandon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Leffe Belgium beer on draught. Cosy bar close to the Anne Frank House site. Old world setting with comfy chairs. Dogs welcome. Ideal for a quick refreshment.
25,Brandon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Old school, lovely place"
26,Brandon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is perfect. Good beer, wonderful old world atmosphere, comfy chairs, friendly staff. This is the kind of place that makes Amsterdam special. Not to be missed."
27,Brandon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The perfect dive bar with great draft beer, Leffe.  Just 15 minutes walk from Central Station, Cafe Brandon is located on the corner of a canal/street intersection.  The interior is classic."
28,Brandon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Bags of character. Great location in a beautiful part of town by the canals. Large smoking room which becomes quite the party atmosphere at weekends.
29,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing bar. Really friendly people, cosy, nice music and a really good atmosphere. Difficult to find something similar üòâ"
30,Brandon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the classic dutch Bruin Cafes. It has this old school atmosphere. Mostly locals come here, and it's placed next to a great pizza shop."
31,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,On the outside looks like a basic brown bar. But on weekend nights it turns into a dance floor with some of the most random but good music.
32,Brandon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Had a few drinks outside on a partially sunny Saturday after roaming around the Red Light District all day.  Great location and a really cool cozy bar.
33,Brandon, 1 star ,a year ago,The waiter was unapologetically impolite. He created a unpleasant atmosphere.
34,Brandon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice ‚Äòbruin cafe‚Äô with good selection beers and liquors. Only downside for non smokers is that the seating area is also the smoking area.
35,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Been there on a Saturday evening. Very good music, great atmosphere and friendly people., most of them are locals."
36,Brandon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good local caf√©. Friendly staff and services. No tourist prices. Recommended.
37,Brandon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Bar filled with locals, there might be some dancing envolved on weekendnights. üòâ Obviously one doesn‚Äôt take photos here."
38,Brandon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the oldest bars in Amsterdam. It‚Äôs quite small, but has a lot of character!"
39,Brandon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Really great local bar with some tasty beers and lovely atmosphere.
40,Brandon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very annoying people who are very much into what they are doing, walk through people and step on other peoples' feet. The interior is pretty fun though"
41,Brandon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Unique, traditional, proper dutch beer pub. Lovely. Great atmosphere, special place."
42,Brandon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Amsterdam bar. Go in. Do your stuff. Everybody is cool.
43,Brandon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I don't understand how this place is rated so highly. Zero service, literally no one behind the bar. Bartender was out front smoking."
44,Brandon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Stuffy stuck-up student clubs. Dusty decor. Local lager. Authentic aura.
45,Brandon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cute Dutch corner bar, you can smoke inside though :("
46,Brandon, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Delicious & cheap beer!

52,Brandon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice beer and great spot for people watching.
53,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tempted to give a one star just so others don't go here, but that wouldn't be fair. If I lived here, it would be my local."
54,Brandon, 1 star ,2 years ago,Blonde woman was the rudest waitres I've ever seen.
55,Brandon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had a great time! Although ordering could be confusing for tourists

90,Brandon, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,(Translated by Google) Very unfriendly and arrogant bartender who let it be known in a condescending manner that apfelkorn was not served and I should choose a better drink. Not a pub I'll come back to. ‚Ä¶
