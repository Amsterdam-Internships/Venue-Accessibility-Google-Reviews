0,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The food was delicious and the service was pretty good. My favourite thing about this spot was how relaxed it was. Very laid back atmosphere; it also definitely helped that the location was so gorgeous, even at night. It was well lit enough …"
1,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Honest food, simple service, tranquil location, no frills. It’s a good stop on a warm sunny day after Km of galleries in the nearby museum quarter. …"
2,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Lovely place, wonderfully made espresso Martini and the tajine was absolutely delicious. The costumer service was great as well, every one was very kind and helpful. Plus it's inside Vondelpark, which is a bonus on top of it all."
3,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,4 months ago,"You can wait there for hours, after 45 min waiting they gave me a glass of wine full of water and wine because they “couldn’t wash the glass”, after this they offered to put the same content in a plastic cup, because they didn’t have any clean glass. DISGUSTING"
4,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fancy overprice restaurant with not so clean toilets

I visited this place together with my wife for a business dinner. …"
5,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Totally agree with previous review; mediocre, driven mainly by slow and unfriendly service. The location is great, in the center of Vondelpark. The menu is ok, but service is so mediocre. Some people deliver good and friendly service. But …"
6,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An excellent place for coffee and healthy food in the heart of the Vondelpark. They serve a variety of freshly cooked dishes, and yes; they offer the correct version of the famous Dutch bitterballen. When the sun is out, their terrace is …"
7,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,a month ago,Nice spot. Probably summer must be awesome.
8,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We regretted sitting there. Location is amazing but the service refused to clean our table (full with food  from previous guests) and we were waiting for 20 minutes for our drinks, after they arrived one of the coffees was missing so we …"
9,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Is gorgeous, right in the vondelpark. I onlynordered tea, and my friend 's cappuccino."
10,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great experience at this restaurant as always! Nice location in the park and friendly service.
11,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"This place attracted us for its nice location, by the water enjoying the sun, however the food was way below expectations. We had pancakes, which are so hard to mess up in Holland, however we received them thick and burnt (check the pic). …"
12,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice location. Service was fast and prices were Ok. Good food. Restaurant is in the old film museum close to the main entrance to Vondelpark. Nice place for breakfast, lunch or dinner after a walk through the park."
13,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The service is slow and the food is okay. It's a nice place to sit if you're not in any hurry or have a place to be.
14,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Nice location, Terrible service. Been waiting for 40 minutes for 2 coffees. When asked about their status, they replied it’s busy. Turns out they forgot about them"
15,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It's in a strategic place where lots of people visit the park and just need to have drinks or simple meal. Lovely view of the park and lake, especially on summer. But perhaps due to lack of waitress, we waited a long time before we were served. Same for when we tried to pay."
16,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Nice chilled place with a view on whatever goes on in that part of the Vondelpark. Food ok but a bit bland
17,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"- Food is very good but they have problem doing scrambled eggs (after 11.30 AM ) !
- Service is fairly good - most of the team are friendly and talkative but …"
18,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love the park atmosphere here.  People were really enjoying the afternoon, food, and drinks - for good reason.  So pleasant."
19,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Was there a couple of years ago, a great place for a coffee and chill"
20,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice restaurant cafe in the Vondel park
21,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love going here with friends. Anytime of the day or night. Take a blanket to sit on with some food or go join other people training. Always something to do
22,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,a year ago,A nice location. Nice staff. But NO idea what a Bloody Mary should be. The description on the menu should have raised concern. But it didn’t prepare us for a plain Tomato juice.
23,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The location is amazing as is the view but the service is not so good. The coffee is good (latte macchiatto), and the price is ok."
24,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A beautiful place in the Vondel park for drinks and coffee. I have not had food here.
25,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Very good location, good terraces.  Nice to sit in fine weather.  Normal menu"
26,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,a year ago,"The ordering app is not working, after waiting 15 for somebody to pick my order, the waiter recommend a draft beer that they were running off.  Ordering cakes follows the same pattern: ""sorry, we don't have vegan brownie"", so we have the choose other cake, and surprise, after 5 minutes: ""here is your brownie"""
27,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely park helped by some amazing weather
28,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Wonderful atmosphere and lovely staff! A picturesque view of the park sitting at their terrace by the grandiose building of Vondelpark3
29,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I've been to this restaurant several times and really love the food and menu, albeit overpriced. Regardless, I really enjoy both the indoor experience in the winter and the terrace experience during the summer. I've gotten decent service here, it's just important to flag the waitstaff a little more aggressively when needed."
30,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The location is absolutely amazing and the building itself is also really nice to look at. But the service and the app they want you to order from is... well, not that good. It feels like they always are under staffed and you have to fight for the waitress/waitresses attention."
31,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely park and the food was great at the cafe!
32,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A beautiful place for a romantic walk and alfresco lunch or dinner. Only four stars because of too much Poison Ivy.
33,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I was not surprised that this place was empty because it has a lousy service.  Even being empty to serve us a coffee and a miserable cappuccino with a cake took a long time;  First the coffee arrived, shortly after the cake and it seems …"
34,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Noce beer, nice service, nice food"
35,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice view from the terrace. Very creative and useful way to order things - by app! Orders are served very quick. Pancakes with syrup are AMAZING! Beef carpaccio is ok. The restaurant isn't very expensive, even though the food is tasty. I can really recommennd it to others."
36,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Had dinner with colleague's here. It was average. Service was slow.
37,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Well. In the greatest park on this planet there is a little place where you can go to grab a few drinks and some snacks. Didn't try their food to be honest but it's location cannot be described. You have o experience it! Amazing place. Will definitely be back soon
38,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good beer, terrible service. Extremely difficult to get our waitress to take order requests and bring the bill. She did not bring the bill even after it was requested 10 minutes prior (we waited 30 minutes before approaching her)"
39,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,3 years ago,Decent food with relatively good prices for Amsterdam. Service leaves a lot of room for improvement. A waiter spilled beers from the tablet on us and we didn’t get anything except a ‘Sorry’ and a kitchen roll to clean up his mess on the …
40,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Neither exceptional nor poor, my lunchtime visit showed me that the restaurant here is highly suitable for a working meal or a short snack. Prices are high, as would be expected for such a prestigious and rather elegant setting, but quality …"
41,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Maybe this place is too hip for us. The portions were quite small and we were happy they had a lot of healthy, yummy and also vegan options, but we were hungry again after about an hour. They have a keto concept, great idea but we don't …"
42,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, great service, great atmosphere and a stunning location"
43,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,3 years ago,This place used to be so nice. It's a shame what has become of it. Know what you wish for when you go here. …
44,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Great location, ask for a table outside in the terrace to enjoy view on Vondelpark"
45,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great relaxing park. Beautiful
46,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice location to have a drink and enjoy the sun when it's out. Unfortunately the service(even though it is self service) is just a disaster. Takes a long time to get drinks and/or food. The new system by ordering with an app looks promising but haven't had the chance to test this for a second time.
47,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Extremely slow service. Poor timing in regard to when we got our drinks and when we got our food. Waited 30 minutes for food. and almost just as long for our bill. The restaurant was rather full, so they might have been low on staff. Food was still excellent, but if you don't have a lot of time to spare, try somewhere else."
48,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,5 years ago,The price is way too high for such a low-quality food! Idfc if I pay more for good food while sitting outside with a nice view but this restaurant must be a joke. I ordered a cesar salad and it was the worst salad I ever had in my life! We …
49,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Prices are high and the tables were dirty as it took them too long time to clean them up for every new table(there's a good change that they were busy more than usual as there was a marathon event in the park)... but the location is great and it's really nice sitting there on the terrace and to enjoy the sun
50,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Good value for money and very nice views to the park
51,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,2 years ago,It took 45 min to get this and they gave us the wrong check. Too bad!
52,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible service. They need more staff...  Don't really understand the sign wait to be seated while nobody is coming to greet you. You need to wait 20 minutes to get the waiter's attention. Better to order by the app
53,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,3 years ago,"For this price, I would expect a professional service. Wrong order, they were bringing at my table someone else's order, they pushed for a choice immediately after I seated without giving me the time to give not even a quick look to the menu. Very unprofessional. I save only the food quality, which is decent."
54,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The food is good, and the seating downstairs has a great view. But the service downstairs is appalling. People sat at tables can be left waiting for 10 minutes before being served."
55,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice park there's several spots to chill, and various places to eat all around the park, if you are on vacations on Amsterdam this is a place to visit."
56,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Great glühwein. Self service on top terrace but not the bottom, which wasn't at all clear. Dirty table. A bit too loud music in the bar for a relaxed afternoon drink."
57,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty fantastic place to have a drink on a warm summer’s day. Beautiful spot, great terrace, wide variety of drinks and food."
58,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible service had to wait 15 to 20 mins just to get the servers attention. Then another 10 to 15 to make an order. A lot better places to eat in Amsterdam!
59,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,6 years ago,"After being served my lunch along with collegues, I continued working by myself at the large table in the middle. For over 2,5 HOURS I was not asked anything, if everything was ok or if I would like another drink. There were 5 personnel and it was super calm so there is no excuse here. Completely unacceptable."
60,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The vondelpark is an ABSOLUTE must see. It is fantastic. I gave it 4 stars because EVERYONE visits it, and it is too busy for my liking, especially in spring and summer. Try the Flevopark for some more space!"
61,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very expensive, 9€ for a weizenbier!!! The Food is ok but the service really slow and make us feel not welcome at all. we felt like a tourist trap."
62,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,3 years ago,"If you are celiac do not eat the lemon cheesecake, it says glutenfree on the menu,  waiter  assured me it was safe, I' ve got very, very sick from it (date 7 July around 12,30 pm)"
63,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,3 years ago,Nice place but we had to order the drinks three times until we got them. Traces of red lipstick on the class. But finally an excuse!
64,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,3 years ago,You're paying an upcharge for the location and nothing else. Food is quite mediocre and the servers range from indifferent to openly rude. What a pity as it's a beautiful location in Vondelpark.
65,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Ncie to chill with a glass of wine otside, lovely and friendly service."
66,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome place. Must order online using phone on website or app. NO CASH ACCEPTED. Upstairs terrace had an amazing view of the park.
67,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Flakey website used to order things, takes your money but doesn't confirm the order.  Turns what could be an enjoyable place to eat into a McDonald's /febo style place to eat"
68,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice place, sun (if there) all afternoon."
69,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful location in Vondelpark and nice terrace. Food was good but quite expensive (and relatively small portions). Overall, I'd go there for the terrace not the food :)"
70,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent spot when the weather is good, with plenty of out door seating. Friendly and efficient service, big thumbs up."
71,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful building, good food, but very chaotic and not helpful staff. Have been waiting for the napkin for 20 mins, after trying to find it ourselves. Found it in the toilet"
72,Vondelpark3, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Takes more than 20min to get my beer ..bitterballen came pretty fast but in my opinion shold improve the service..the location is cool but not worth in the end
73,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"very good view and location but workers at the bar are arrogant.

75,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place nice beer?

77,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice restaurant - café inside Vondelpark.

Perfect to sit and take the sun in the summer while you grab a bite or a wine."
78,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A beautiful park where you can jog, walk or just appreciate the nature while sit on the grass. There are places there you can have coffee and relax."

80,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice view and great location. But overpriced and an very unoriginal menu. Its mainly for tourists...
81,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"My friend enjoyed her food, but I barely touched mine. However, staff was quick and friendly."
82,Vondelpark3, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I feel they could do more with the great location. Bad food and service but in summer seating outside in the vondelpark makes everything better
83,Vondelpark3, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Boozhy but fun. Just go for a coffee or whatever. The staff don’t mind you hanging out for a while especially at off hours. Good on a rainy day.
84,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Could be a great place.It has alot of potencial  It is in a beautiful building, setting & surroundings.. Service is HORRIBLE, staff Rude!"

87,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Terrible. Just looks fancy, but overly expensive for crap, and the worst Irish Coffee I've ever had, and that at €7.50?!? Get real. Won't be coming back."
88,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great location but painfully slow service. I do go back often though because it is a great terrace but the waits can be obscene.

94,Vondelpark3, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely terrace in the lush park, in front of a beautiful monumental building. Service can be slow."
95,Vondelpark3, 1 star ,4 years ago,Unbelievably slow and inefficient service. 30 minute wait for a cup of tea and then they had written the order wrong. So another 15 minute wait.
