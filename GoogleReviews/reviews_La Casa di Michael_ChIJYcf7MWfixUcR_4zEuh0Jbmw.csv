Nice little restaurant if you need to eat something quick especially when staying at the Xo Hotel nearby"
17,La Casa di Michael, 1 star ,a year ago,Very disappointed by Pizza parma. Have you ever seen one big raw diced tomato on a pizza? Accompanied by two slices of raw parma ham and some leaves of rucola. For 11 euro. Can‚Äôt understand how this place can have so many stars-that‚Äôs what brought us here in the first place. Unfortunately.
18,La Casa di Michael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"You must visit here! Their Italian food, pasta and pizzas, is delicious. The owners are friendly and have created a welcoming space that's busy each night of the week. They're really nice people and have a talented chef. And look how generous that glass of wine is!"
19,La Casa di Michael, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Tortellini and cannellini obviously frozen and the tiramisu is NOT real tiramisu.. just some ladyfingers with store bought whipped cream... Definitely not going back. Before serving we saw the waitress touch the silverware top part with her hands... which is kinda disgusting.
20,La Casa di Michael, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, great service and a warm atmosphere. Nice touch: pizza toppings are so nicely arranged, you don‚Äôt see that often in Amsterdam."

75,La Casa di Michael, 5 stars ,a year ago,Extremely friendly staff and very good food. The choice on the menu was nowhere short overwhelming.
