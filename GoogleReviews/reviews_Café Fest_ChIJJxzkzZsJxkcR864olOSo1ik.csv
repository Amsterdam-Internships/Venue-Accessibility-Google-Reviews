Foos is nice if you add more chicken will be great. If we compare between streetfood kapslon and here. Here is great but need more meat."
1,Caf√© Fest, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Located between school buildings so it‚Äôs full of students working on their laptops or chatting with friends. Outdoor seating is also available.
