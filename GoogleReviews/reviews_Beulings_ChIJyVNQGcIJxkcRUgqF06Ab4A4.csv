0,Beulings, 5 stars ,7 months ago,One of the best meals I've ever had.  Beautiful intimate atmosphere.  A dinner that seemed to have Neverending courses.  Everything was perfect.
1,Beulings, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Beulings is an outstanding and unique small restaurant of only seven tables. The chef is producing highly creative dishes, often ‘fusion’, truly superb in flavors,  perfect cuisson of deer, deep sauces, delightful desserts. I’d give them …"

8,Beulings, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice ambience and service. Anyhow the food menu needs more work to make it special. The kitchen should have a better ventilation system.

10,Beulings, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, intimate art-decoish furniture, amazing service (best I ever had). 2 stars off for the food and time. The food was probably too weird tasting...shrimp with the shrimps liver made into a paste, one of the amuse bouche was …"

17,Beulings, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We’ve chosen the restaurant to celebrate an event. The wines were great! The service was great! The food, though, was too ‘modern’ from my point of view. For example, for the lamb dish I’ve expected lamb meat taste and/or flavor, but …"

20,Beulings, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Food is good but not surprising as you should expect in a place like this. Unfortunately this wasn't the case, especially shocking was a kind of tribute to Dutch land with potatoes with clay. One of them quite dissapointing due to the lack …"

29,Beulings, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"After you took place, the waitress tells you what's on the daily changing menu. It's possible to order single courses but it's recommended to go for the 3 up to 7 course menu. With all the amuses the 4 course is enough, unless you're very …"
