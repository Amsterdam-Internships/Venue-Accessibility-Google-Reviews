0,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, music and ambience. Service is good but can take a bit time during busy hours.
A mix of tasty Indian and Asian food. Vegan and vegetarian with a flavor. Behaved dogs are allowed."
1,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a month ago,Delicious food with many nice vegan options. The personnel was very kind and polite.
2,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"A must go for Indian food. Nice decor and sitting. Food tea worth the price( yes it‚Äôs not on the higher end). To all fellow Indians missing home food, try the north Indian thali(platter) it‚Äôs a real home food. Authentic taste and flavours."
3,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"A wonderful place with special food, high quality and delicious! Even if you like eating meat you would not miss anything when you eat out at the Golden Temple. And it was so cosy - we went there with 2 teenagers and a kid and had a great ‚Ä¶"
4,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Fantastic food. I ate here on the eve of my 30th birthday shortly before proposing to my fianc√©e and it was wonderful, brilliant atmosphere, delicious food, friendly staff (I spoke to the Scottish waitress (possibly owner) and she was very welcoming and affable). I will definitely visit again next time I'm in Amsterdam!"
5,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,a month ago,"We were not seated for 10 mins despite having a reservation. They got our order wrong. The Indian dishes we ordered were very bland and watery - nothing remotely authentic about them. The food mostly consisted of just sauce, so the meal was ‚Ä¶"
6,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Very lovely venue. Original decoration and very comfy seats. The food was nice. Very good choice for Veg. Food :)
7,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Food was amazing, great service. Space inside the restaurant was quite cramped. I should have taken some effort to see something other than the top 5 pictures on Google."
8,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Absolutely amazing experience. Wonderful staff and food, great atmosphere and great food. (I did leave on a rush so forgot to tip sorry about that.)"
9,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great family friendly restaurant.
Only one of us is vegetarian but we all had a wonderful meal!"
10,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a month ago,"The menu could use an update. Still the same from last time. However, the food is fabulous and the staff is just amazing! Thank you for the grand dinner! üòç"
11,Golden Temple, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We had an Indian dish and salad. Salad was tasty and fresh, the Indian dish didn't have much flavour and was very basic, 20‚Ç¨ idnt worth the price and quality. In a proper Indian restaurant you get these small plates as a starter not as for main dish. The service was nice and place looking cozy and with a character."
12,Golden Temple, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Super disappointing and overpriced meal. The ambience and decor was lovely but the food really didn't match up. As someone who has tried a lot of authentic Indian food, the 'Flavours of India' was just really watery and the portions were ‚Ä¶"
13,Golden Temple, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"As with some other reviewers here, I'm a bit puzzled by the high ratings. The food is OK - a bit lacking in punch, but healthy at least. Prices should be about half what they are though. That said, the decor and ambience is nice."
14,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Really Nice food! The Pizza was a nice dish, and the orange juice is really nice, the Green Enchilada was really nice mexican food too :)"
15,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a year ago,Friendly service and comfort food. The advocado nori tempura is a must and the blue corn tortilla with pulled jackfruit delish (photo). We will comeback for sure to try the long menu options the restaurant offers.
16,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They serve Vegan food!
The food was absolutely amazing. I was really impressed with how delicious it was. ‚Ä¶"
17,Golden Temple, 1 star ,4 months ago,"This meal was hauntingly ensaddening. Not sure why it gets 4 and 5 star ratings, maybe the vegetarian population of Amsterdam applaud crimes against food. ‚Ä¶"
18,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Amazing place. The menu is amazing and staff super nice.
19,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely stunning. Best food I've had in Amsterdam. South Asian/ Indian cities, tempeh, amazing salad, creative imaginative dishes, about ‚Ç¨18 for a main. Beautiful place. Comfy and magical"
20,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I really enjoyed my meal here. The staff were very friendly and the vegan options were quite varied. Thanks for a lovely evening.

22,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great experience in a suggestive location.
Staff is super friendly."
23,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The staff is really lovely. The interior is like another world apart from the street of Amsterdam. You get i  the proper mood for the food. The restaurant have a wide variety of food and many vegan options. Ordered appetizers only, all of them delicious."
24,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This place deserves a much better rating than it currently has (4.4 at the time of writing this review). Amazing food, good service, good music, extremely confortable tables upstairs!"
25,Golden Temple, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food. New guy forgot the glasses, and we were missing our mango chutneys, but other than that, very good. ‚Ä¶"
26,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Big brave flavors of Mexico, south and east asia, and yes Italy, delivered inexpensively with fortitude. By which I mean there is very little meat mimicry. Shout outs for the Pizza the Tofu Tikka Masala, the Avocado Tempura and the tacos. Why the missing star? The Cheesecake was forgettable."
27,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice small place with friendly staff! Had a mix of curries and a pizza which all tasted very nice!
28,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice and relaxed vibe. Service is exquisit and the food is varying and very much vegan friendly. ‚Ä¶

30,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This restaurant was a huge surprise, first because we were lucky enough to get a table on a Saturday night without a reservation (if you can, don't do that). The waitress was very lovely and attentive. The food was simply delicious. I had ‚Ä¶"

33,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very good food and friendly staff! We went with 6 people an 2 dogs and they were very accommodating to seat us in the upstairs terrace. All the vegetarian options were great!
34,Golden Temple, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is good, but nothing special. The service was quick in the beginning: we were served our drinks and got our menus. After we got our food it was like they forgot about us. We really wanted to get some dessert, but after waiting for ‚Ä¶"
35,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food. Book ahead as it gets very busy here. It's good to know they have regular cheese if you want it... You don't have to go totally vegan.
36,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The atmosphere looked really nice from the outside but we got seated at an end table in the back, with little space. The dishes looked amazing on the plate but unfortunately the meal of the day tasted mediocre. I'll try another time."
37,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Super friendly service and amazing food!

We were upstairs - it looked and was very cosy. ‚Ä¶"
38,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fenomenal service, fenomenal food and just all around great vibes. Even if you're not vegan or vegetarian, Golden Temple is a must visit if you love great food!"
39,Golden Temple, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We ended up having a pizza because the traditional dishes were so overpriced. The pizza was good as were the spring rolls but they cost way more than they should have. Pro-tip: reserve the lounge table ahead of time. They do not take discover
40,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want good, healthy and fresh vegan or vegetarian food this is the place to get it. Great atmosphere and staff, only downside is the price but hey, it's Amsterdam!"
41,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,a year ago,I enjoyed the food and atmosphere at the Golden temple. I went for an indian classic that was full of flavour and indian spices though you can get a pizza there too. Nice decoration. ‚Ä¶
42,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Wonderful vegan and gluten free options - excellent service too. Boho style interior - relaxed and great atmosphere. Also there is a small little roof terrace.
43,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of the best dishes I had in time. If you are a vegetarian food lover this is a must.
44,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing, healthy food and great, very friendly staff. Highly recommended!"
45,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I've never left a bad review in my life but yesterday's meal was amazingly disappointing and overpriced I had to say something. My friend and me were excited to try this alleged 5 star-vegetarian-restaurant out, what we got was a selection ‚Ä¶"
46,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Though I am an hardcore non vegetarian,  I simply relished the vegetarian fare served,  would definitely recommend this for anyone visiting Amsterdam"
47,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good service,
Good food (beside Indian also some Mexican and Italian flavors on the menu),
Lovely interior!"
48,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had a special occasion so we ordered some food. I missed the lovely restaurant atmosphere, however the food was great and substantial. I wouldn't call it traditional indian, it has more of a western twist. Great nevertheless! Ive never ‚Ä¶"
49,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food! Even a non-vegetarian would love it!
Nice and cozy, informal atmosphere.

52,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Its great to have so many vegan options. Very friendly and helpful staff, our North Indian Thali was very tasty, great flavours, not spicy though. There are also  a few ""low-sit lounge couches"", that give the place extra cosiness. for our ‚Ä¶"

55,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I really liked it there. The food is so amazingly good and the ambiente is also stunning. You see and taste that averything is done with love at this space.
Great menu as well. Can't decide what to eat because it all sounds delicious. Healthy, natural vegetarian/ vegan food - just perfect!"
56,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great atmosphere and food! My recommendation is you get the thali (can be made vegan, no paneer). If youre a bigger group you should also try to reserve the big table next to the street ;)"
57,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great place, good food and nice people!"
58,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The Golden Temple is amazing! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the food is out of this world - eating here is a must if you're in Amsterdam. The menu has a great variety of dishes, so there is definitely something for everybody here. I absolutely love the Golden Temple and I hope to visit again  soon!"
59,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,a year ago,The service staff was great and the place is very quirky and nice. The food left something to be desired.. as an Indian I found the Indian food a little lacking in flavor and texture. The pizzas were very good though.
60,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"It was really delicious!!! Very good, also the atmosphere!"
61,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, great people, great restaurant, absolutely amazing."
62,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"One of the best vegetarian restaurants I have been to.
I would just go there for late night desserts, totally worth it."

64,Golden Temple, 1 star ,2 years ago,After waiting at entrance for a few awkward minutes the waitress eventually told us that we could have a table if we finish within an hour. ‚Ä¶
65,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is one of the best restaurants in the city. A very diverse vegan menu with delicious deserts. I have eaten here plenty of times and tried out multiple dishes and have never left unsatisfied. The staff is very nice and friendly. They always go out of their way to make the customers happy! Overall an amazing restaurant.
66,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice staff! We felt very welcome. And lucky to find a table on Friday evening! Atmosphere is perfect - cozy and relaxing. Personally I always prefer cooking at home  than eating out because I am very picky vegan but in Golden Temple I ‚Ä¶

70,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was delightful, I enjoyed a lot, it could be a bigger serving though"
71,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Honestly, I loved everything about this place except for the service. Waitress never came around, we were always having to call her over. Then, after telling us that we could share a plate between two for the price of one she charged us ‚Ä¶"
72,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Quirky restaurant. Mostly vegan menu. My drink was not upto the mark.

74,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Truely disappointing. Visiting Amsterdam for two days for our anniversary and we were excited to try some delicious vegan finds. While the menu is 90% vegan and the decor is lovely, the service and food quality was lacking. Took border an ‚Ä¶"
75,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is easily one of the Top 3 best vegetarian restaurants in Amsterdam. The Tofu Tikka Masala, the Tacos, and the mixed appetizer plate are SO SO YUMMY ! Food is fresh, consciously prepared and served, and the ambience and music is so ‚Ä¶"
76,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I think if you are expecting spicy, flavoursome Indian food, then this isn't the place for it. I'm an Aussie from a Pakistani ethnic background, used to very rich flavours. The Indian Thali tasted like water. The Enchiladas which my hubby had were good so I ate his food. That was good!"
77,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A pure vegetarian Indian restaurant in Amsterdam was a reason enough for me to cheer. But, there was more! It is a cosy (not luxurious) restaurant with great food. White we sat on simple wooden table for four, right on the entry is a ‚Ä¶"
78,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A great expirience. We started with the rice papers which where great with a tasty dip. Then we ate the main of the many small dishes with the chapati. It was very tasty but spicy. And for a desert we ate the lime pie which was so good!!! ‚Ä¶
79,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent food, very pleasant atmosphere. Would wholeheartedly recommend !"
80,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Coming from an Indian background I know about the taste of Indian cuisine, so the review is purely based on authenticity of taste. The Tofu Tikka Masala that I had ordered for mains had a lot to be desired. The presentations were pretty decent, but can't say the same for taste."
81,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely food. Great space. Great service. The Taste of India dish was inspiring. The tempeh peanut salad was extraordinaire with such a variety of vegetables and flavours. Yum. The desserts were the perfect end to a perfect dinner. Has to wait quite a bit for the mains, but it was worth the wait."
82,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,An amazing gem on the east side of the Central Canal District. Incredible Indian dishes with excellent depth of flavor all prepared with close attention to the details of vegetarian and vegan. Most dishes were vegan and others could be made so. Very friendly staff. The place gets busy and crowded but it is SO worth it!
83,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,The nachos and enchiladas were amazing.
84,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We went there a group of 30 persons. I could book the place only two days ahead. The food is great, the staff is the most friendly and nice I've seen. With a group of 30 people that was hard to manage but they did it perfectly. Smiling and ‚Ä¶"
85,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing restaurant! We went there for the first time and we immediately fell in love with the food ! There are a lot of gluten free choices, and the products are fresh and well prepared. The staff is really friendly and the price is fair. We will be back again, for sure!"

87,Golden Temple, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Ordered overpriced Indian, got mediocre Mexican priced ‚Ç¨10 cheaper. Wouldn't pick up the phone either."
88,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Without a doubt the tastiest tofu curry I've had the pleasure of consuming in quite a while. Along with a starter of fried avocado, with a very tasty dip by the way, and a glass or two of bio/organic merlot, everything served by very ‚Ä¶"

90,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amsterdam is plenty of eastern ad Indian Restaurants. I knew them well, since 1995.  But i never found a place with this enchanted mood, and this good vibes. the food is delicious, Lekker, like they say in A'dam, spicy but delicate, and so ‚Ä¶"
91,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Rather pretentious restaurant that suffers from a bit of an identity crisis. Tries to mix Indian and eastern decor with a mix of vegetarian food from all over the world and fails in this regard. ‚Ä¶
92,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Unique vegetarian restaurant in the centre of Amsterdam. Very reasonably priced, friendly Dutch speaking staff and delicious food. Seems a popular place, thus busy, so might be smart to make reservations. Beware, the flatbread has lots and lots of garlic, but tastes delicious."
93,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loving it and I am not vegetarian! Good food, good service and great ambiance upstairs."
94,Golden Temple, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is delicious, and there are loads of options. The menu seems eclectic, but you have to understand they've kept the theme of being Amsterdam's first vegetarian restaurant 47 years and running. ‚Ä¶"
95,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food and drinks! Lots of vegan options, even for dessert! The only downside was that we had to wait a while for the waitress to notice us while everyone around is had all their food and were even finished. Still had a great time and will come back again soon!"
96,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Contact (around reservation and Corona) before was already very sweet, waiters were super nice. Food was amazing.  And loved the setting! Thank you!"
97,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My friend and I came here after tiring of meat heavy dutch food. We treated ourselves to vegetable pakora and spring rolls ( south asian style) and then the Indian banquet (chapatti with various stews such as daal, chickpea curry, saag ‚Ä¶"
98,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Super tasty food. Its a bit small and was fully booked but we got a nice table within 15 minutes. The menu we had to ask for but once we oredered food it came within 5 minutes and it was superb. Would love to eat this food again.

100,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We ended up eating here twice on our recent visit to Amsterdam. We had really tasty, fresh food both times. Not too expensive, easy to get to as the no 4 tram stops almost right outside."
101,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The Golden Temple offers an excellent selection of vegetarian dishes with some gluten free options. The service was friendly and efficient; the food was excellent and the check was reasonable. We would definitely return.
102,Golden Temple, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Service was good but food was just OK, and a bit pricy."
103,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Do not be mislead by the name! Be mislead by the name! And that describes Golden Temple the best. Inspired by the Indian Sick temple, the restaurant radiates positivity, health and beauty (at a deeper level). And this is where all the ‚Ä¶"
104,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Ate there last night. Sometimes it can be difficult to find places to eat in the Netherlands as a vegan. Everything on the menu is vegetarian and about 80% vegan. Artsy and peaceful atmosphere, friendly staff and absolutely delicious food. Will be returning again!"
105,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy and semi-romantic. (it was crowded and a tad noisy). I had the curry of the day and it was yummy. They have a few Mexican food items as well.
106,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Good vegan and vegetarian eurasian food. Not that cheap.
107,Golden Temple, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I have dined here a few times and the food has always been good , unfortunately i ate here two days ago and i had pumpkin soup it arrived cold when i complained they just took it away and microwaved it ‚Ä¶"
108,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Very delicious vegetarian and vegan food! Cozy atmosphere and very kind and fast service!
109,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had such a wonderful evening at this restaurant. A very interesting range of food, definitely worth the price, staff were also completely lovely, will definitely be returning if we come back to Amsterdam"
110,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Menu was a little odd - quite varying cuisines mixed in. I get that they wan't to be able to have many guests at a time but the tables were a bit too close together. The food was delicious though.
111,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This restaurant is lovely. Brilliant vegan choices and very moreish food. The only let down was that the service was quite slow so I wouldn't recommend going if you're in a hurry!
112,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,7 years ago,The food was off the chain!! Very healthy and you could taste the delic veggies. Great ambience. .chill music and cute interior design. Highly recommend the 'nutty goat' pizza and 'Turkish quinoa' ...amazing
113,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"My wife and I had some wonderful vegetarian food here.  I had a southeast Asian coconut curry, she had a ""traditional Mexican"" dish with spicy black beans.  Both were great."
114,Golden Temple, 1 star ,4 years ago,Worst restaurant experience of my life. Entire dinner party fel ill from the food. Called restaurant - they told us it 'couldn't have been them' and 'at least you're now no longer ill'. ‚Ä¶
115,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We ordered the South East Asia curry for delivery. The curry was ‚Ç¨21 and listed as a ‚ÄòBig Main‚Äô The portion size was very small, the taste was nice but nothing special to justify the price of this dish."
116,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Some of the best chai I've ever had. I had the thali and each dish was distinctly flavoured and the meal was sufficiently portioned and filling. Was worth the price and would absolutely recommend.
117,Golden Temple, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice food, but they are not generous with spices -- mexican was not spicy AT ALL, the same with the curry dish and quinoa risotto could need some salt and pepper. Tiny, and I mean TINY, portions.
20 euro for at dish that leaves you hungry is too much"
118,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super friendly staff and cozy atmosphere, the food here is fresh, delicious and very filling. Great vegan, gluten free and soy free options. Try the trio of pies and the tacos!"
119,Golden Temple, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Food was creative in presentation and ingredients but not put well together I'm terms of taste. Very pricey for their tiny portion sizes
120,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food was fantastic and the service was great too. The restaurant got really busy later on in the night so you should probably go early if possible
121,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Their raw chocolate cake is A M A Z I N G. A must try. Their customer service is excellent as well! Very friendly. I just wouldn't mind a slightly bigger portion.
122,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food here is simply mind-blowing. This place   has a lot of vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options. The only bad side is that there's no Air Conditioning, and so the place was a little too hot. The staff is very friendly, and they solved the problem by giving us their own hand fans."
123,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"I recommend everyone to come here, the service is excellent, the dishes are delicious, the presentation is beautiful"
124,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Soup of the day- pumpkin soup was great. Nice vegan place. The Thali looked delicious but we din't have it. Pakoras could have been better.
125,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Authentic Turkish cuisine. Really like and hope you guys keep up the quality standards. ‚Ä¶

137,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"So tasty and fresh. But pricey. I chew the fresh food slowly, so I get the feeling that I'm full in the end. Beautiful paintings on the walls..."

139,Golden Temple, 4 stars ,4 years ago,So fresh and tasty. Vegetarian restaurant with an Indian/Asian menu.  I loved the kitcheree - reminded me of the one my mom makes.
140,Golden Temple, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I think this is one of the best restaurants I ate in! Golden Temple is also an example of how vegan food can be extremely delicious! Very nice staff as well!
