0,De Kroon, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very good cocktail! Balanced flavor and top presentation!
1,De Kroon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A good place to chill out. Free entry. Drinks are priced at Eur 10. DJ is good. Dancefloor is big enough to accommodate 50-80 people
2,De Kroon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was ok here, unfortunately nothing to write home about. Restaurant itself is very nice and modern, the appetizers were quite good, but the main dishes especially the burgers can be done way better. The spare ribs on the other hand were ‚Ä¶"
3,De Kroon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Go to location around Rembrandtsquare for a Latin night, both ambiance and food is usually on standard. Would advise to make reservations for seating with views over the square with a cocktail."
4,De Kroon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"AMAZING DRINKS FOR 5 EURO, Gin Tonic! Live DJ! People are dancing and it's has a wonderful atmosphere! Food stops at 10 pm. Only drinks after."
5,De Kroon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,de Kroon is a good place for Latin music. They host 2 salsa/bachata parties every week - Wednesday and Sunday with free entrance.
6,De Kroon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely the most divine food we have had so far travelling through France, Austria and Belgium. The steak was cooked to perfection and amazing flavours and accompaniments. Great chefs !! ‚Ä¶"
7,De Kroon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had a great meal here with friends and enjoyed the DJ - great service and tasty food and cocktails.
8,De Kroon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice restaurant and caffe.
We went there on Latin night and some bite before it. Food was good. Burger slightly hot but very tasty, Dutch plate very nice. ‚Ä¶"
9,De Kroon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Really touristic and staff that did not care on helping customers to enjoy their evening. Are you really charging customers to use the restroom? Really? Second star only for nice view of Rembrantplein and the fact you can dance there.
10,De Kroon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I will definitely be coming back here. Right on the square with a nice staff and somehow avoiding the worst of the tourists. Had a great time here with my girlfriend. Relaxing with chilled out music, a place to go when the party atmosphere ‚Ä¶"
11,De Kroon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Visited with a big group of co-workers, the service was good and the food was OK (we had to order beforehand from a limited menu with our group size and the portions were small- except the dessert üòç). We went on a Wednesday and all of a ‚Ä¶"
12,De Kroon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good taste of kitchen Chef, dishes are very good. Upstairs place to drink a beer and chill on a balcony. Dj who know what people want and nice place to dance for around 90 people. I recommend this place for sure"
13,De Kroon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"If you‚Äôre traveling, don‚Äôt forget to have cash for your coat check and the bathroom. Great interior design with a fun place for young people. It can feel a little touristy depending on the night"
14,De Kroon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Place is really nice to hangout with friends. Very spacious and have balcony vie where u can smoke. Every thing was good but the DJ sucks.
15,De Kroon, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The place was decent but I'm writing to share my horrible experience with the toilet attendant, I believe her name is Natasha. ‚Ä¶"
16,De Kroon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The dining area is situated on the first floor, and overlooks Rembrandts Plein, so the view is plesent. The food is ok. Check the Menu beforehand, it is somewhat limited. But if you are looking for a quick bite or a casual drink, its good enough."
17,De Kroon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Common cafe in the Amsterdam, can go for a quick tea, coffee or coke, atmosphere is good and so do the sitting arrangements, but the prices are bit higher and food is also ok, not that great. Please dont keep much expectations from this ‚Ä¶"
18,De Kroon, 1 star ,3 years ago,Lined up for this place the other night. After 20 minutes got to the front where the hostess asked what club we were at. Seeing that we were in front of De Kroon we said exactly that. She then told us that was wrong and denied us entry. ‚Ä¶
19,De Kroon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"They do not know how to make cocktails. That is a fact. Also, you have to pay with coins every time you have to use the toilet! The food is OK and so is the music. Those are what the 3 stars are for."
20,De Kroon, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very bad costumer service. I was having a nice evening out with my friends. The waiter took the wrong order and forced us to pay more they we should. I don‚Äôt recommend this place at all!!!!
21,De Kroon, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to have a drink.
In my opinion the food is a little overpriced but it's in the middle of one of the main squares for partying at night so you can expect what you get. ‚Ä¶"
22,De Kroon, 1 star ,2 years ago,Worst club in Amsterdam. this night club can't even get people in for free. Girls at coat check in are the rudest ladies ever. No need to be rude to hand and retrieve jackets.
23,De Kroon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to sit outside and watch the world go by very nicely decorated inside also with good selection of cocktails or even just coffee good selection of light nibbles or sharing platers staff mostly helpful. Great location with lots entertainment going on round about with good service
24,De Kroon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had so much fun here. Loved the Salsa dance party.
25,De Kroon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Fun bar to have a drink on the balcony overlooking the square. Also very well decorated. The service was not good though. Incorrect drinks were delivered and also rather slow.
26,De Kroon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice upstairs place. We had an afternoon drink there. If you're lucky you can find a seat at the street window and enjoy the view over the Rembrandplein.
27,De Kroon, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Here right now dude. It's fancy as balls but not too expensive. 2.50 for a Heineken Fluitje whatever that is. Sick third floor n good with a chick. Midnight on a Thursday and no dancing thoe. Just pretty piano music. Hot neighborhood thoe
28,De Kroon, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"worst stake i ever had!
I wanted  rib eye but what i got was mostly fat and tendons

29,De Kroon, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"An American friend brought me here once. We had a drink only, interior/prices/service were average but the view and space were good compared to other places in the area."
30,De Kroon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and very good service.
IT was cool when they transformer the restaurant into a lounge/club. ‚Ä¶"
31,De Kroon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,There was one very unfriendly waitress. I guess she was afraid we were just going to sit and not order anything. Afterwards a nice one came. That made it a whole lot better.
32,De Kroon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, beautiful location and super friendly waiters. The food was great and at a very reasonable price. Would surely go backüéâüëçüèª"
33,De Kroon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Have been going here for years but food not so good yesterday. Chicken burger poor. Still got a nice atmosphere
34,De Kroon, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The place is beautiful and the prices are fair, the bartender who served us did not know what a negroni is and that she is not supposed to touch the ice that goes in our drink with her dirty hands"
35,De Kroon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The crew is very friendly. Specially the Manager Ronald, is very kind and helpful. The food is tasty! One of the best options at Rembrandtplein"
36,De Kroon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Highly don‚Äôt recommend this place. The waiter got my order wrong and when I payed what I actually ordered, the restaurant manager threatened to call the cops if I didn‚Äôt pay what they asked. Very bad customer service"
37,De Kroon, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Hard to appreciate a restaurant while in a business meeting. It was good but probably deserves another visit to get the top 5 stars
38,De Kroon, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good bar, but it's not a club. It's more of a fine dining place. Good for team get together"
39,De Kroon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I was only there for a drink and accidentally saw the Dame Blanc... That's how you server Icecream and chocolate!

45,De Kroon, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Music was good, however people who works there are so disrespectful and saying rude things."
46,De Kroon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best places in A'dam! Especially if you choose 1st floor, next to window!"
