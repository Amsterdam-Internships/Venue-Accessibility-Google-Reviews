0,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"I very much enjoy the open space and decor here, the beautiful bar, floor with the tram tracks still in place and the palatial seating. They are a higher-end place than the surrounding area, but that means I can usually get a table or seat ‚Ä¶"
1,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Friendly staff and really nice location, especially outside.
Although a bit pricey üí∏"
2,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"This is a very nice spot to go when you are visiting Amsterdam. Relaxed atmosphere, spacious and friendly service. A perfect spot to go when you wanna see a bit more than all the usual spots in Amsterdam."
3,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We were trying to get something to eat outside on the food court but was too crowded so decided to come inside the Kanarie club. It was a good thing as our food wrapped duck and kimchi burger really hit the spot. The young servers were friendly and do their jobs competently. Overall a good dining experience.
4,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitively loved this place.
Food was amazing, girl who served us, Carol, was very professional and gaved us very good recommendations, wine was fine, lamb was so good to lick the fingers ‚Ä¶"
5,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great little spot behind the Foodhallen. Escape here if you want to avoid the often-too-busy Foodhallen. Staff is nice and the menu has enough to offer. Good location to get your remote working game on too, WiFi is strong and a separate table with power outlets."
6,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great Music, Good Vibes, Smart Bar Service, Great for dancing as well as Lounging. Amsterdam Oud West has a cool bird with the Kanarie Club"
7,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Located in the popular Oud-West borough ofAmsterdam, Kanarie Club is a super hip and spacious place with a beautifully styled interior.  The staff is super friendly. Some days it takes a while for the staff to notice you while on other days you're served rather quickly. Portions aren't spectacularly big but the food is good."
8,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious restaurant/bar inside Food Hallen. Great for small bites, lunch, and happy hour. There‚Äôs also place for people who wants to have their private space for work and meetings. Cool atmosphere."
9,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food in a gorgeous setting, the hostesses are lovely and friendly, will hold to be back soon!"
10,Kanarie Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely mediocre. Food is okay but looks poorly prepared, drinks are average, while the service is okay. For example, the croissant was served cold and the lemonade was a piece of lemon with frizzy water. There are far better alternatives in the proximity of the Hallen."
11,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really big space, with a lot of different table settings, a big outside area, and a kind of pool at the mezzanine. Decoration is very cool, retro and modern at the same time. Never tried the food but they have a cool open kitchen, for the drinks it‚Äôs a regular bar."
12,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Located just inside the foodhallen (at the back) - we had the super tostii sandwich and the apple pie. To drink: old mouth cider ‚Äúkiwi and lime‚Äù.
Normal price, nothing out of the ordinary for Amsterdam. Good location with nice ‚Ä¶"
13,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Food is really great! Went for the 4 course chef menu and was pleasantly surprised üëçüèª
14,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Different tastes, different prices. I think some foods are expensive. Especially hot dog."
15,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice interior and vice. Spacious enough to choose to sit outside, by the bar counter or on an upper deck next to a pool."
16,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Menus are a bit typical so to say but the quality of food was satisfactory! It was nice to sit outside with sunshine and great service!
17,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Despite of the Covid guidelines, this place still gave off a warm & friendly vibe! I loved it's quirkiness & the upbeat spirit of all the staff each time I went. ‚Ä¶"
18,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to relax and have a drink. Prices are a bit expensive.
19,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The chef selection of 3 dishes for 35e is really worth it, quality dishes and surprising tastes!"
20,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Bit overrated like everything in the Hallen. Food is great and coffee also so that's not the problem just a bit expensive
21,Kanarie Club, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Very annoying and un-personal ordering system using a website when sitting outside. Plus they make you pay an extra payment fee on ordering each round. Hospitality service reaching new lows, could be so much better as the location is nice."
22,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a drink at the bar. They have great variety, but took ages to get noticed, and then served. While waiting at the bar, I could not believe my eyes when I saw a waitress forcefully stirring a pint of beer with a spoon to get the foam up before taking it to a table. That's not the way to treat beer!"
23,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I came across this restaurant because the food court which it is attached to was full with no place to sit. Initially I was oncerned about service since when you came in there was no one to greet you, but once I was seated  this quickly ‚Ä¶"
24,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Kanarie club was great. Really nice atmosphere and great selection of drinks. The service was really good and the food was great too.
25,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Tasty cocktails and cool vibe
26,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I like this space as there‚Äôs almost always a place to sit. The food portions are a bit small, but the ambiance is nice. Staff is friendly as well. Sometimes it can be a bit loud as it‚Äôs in a big open space which doesn‚Äôt make the meal experience as nice as it could be."
27,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"An experience! That's the perfect way to describe my visit. The whole way of eating is different due to certain menu rules. It almost felt like a game! Can be quite complicated to first time visitors, but the staff is friendly and willing ‚Ä¶"
28,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Atmosphere is really nice and the service is quick. We were there on a Sunday for lunch. They got my drink ordered wrong. The veggie burger was soft and overall a bit disappointing. Fries were over cooked and seemed to have been sitting ‚Ä¶
29,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Massive place that is really quite cool. The upstairs ""swimming pool"" is fun, especially when they have beer pong laid out. Not a great selection of beers on tap (hence the drop in a star) but a decent cocktail selection."
30,Kanarie Club, 1 star ,a year ago,Do not drink any Cocktails at this location just if you seem to be a fan of Ice Cubes. Most of the ordered drinks were simply 90 percent pure ice!
31,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the high ceilings and open, airy environment. Attached to the Food Hallen, this #restobar has a varied menu and a good drinks list. Food prepped in sight, and there is always a bit of action to be witnessed."
32,Kanarie Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere. But it seemed to be understaffed. Ordering a drink took 15 mins at the bar, delivery another 20 mins and the glasses were dirty. Plus there were tables all around that hadn't been cleared. Not a great experience."
33,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The perfect place to realign yourself after sampling the delights of Amsterdam in the evening. ‚Ä¶
34,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely bar and hotspot inside the famous Foodhallen of Amsterdam! I went to experience it on a quiet night, and while the bar was not busy, it took about 15 minutes of waiting directly by the bar for the bartender to take our 3 drink orders. Easily could have been 4-5 stars if not for the unnecessary long wait."
35,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Relatively chill place inside a very (overly i.m.o.) busy food court. Good seating options, bar stools, lounge seats, table chairs etc, and that's pretty fresh. Too much personnel running around asking if you've already been served, ‚Ä¶"
36,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place. The owner let me drop in as a tourist. Staff was extremely nice and pleasant and treated me just like anybody else. Walk in was ‚Ç¨15 which is reasonable with free mats tea towels and water. I will come back when I return to Amsterdam.
37,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing place, so much choice for both food and drink. Very impressive building, really nice atmosphere, also great entertainment. Service is not fast though and prices are very high."
38,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The drinks we had were perfect.
We need to get them directly from the bar but that was fine!
The place is very nice and the atmosphere is cool
I really like this place an will spend some more evenings there"
39,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect place to meet with people and do some work. The restaurant is very spacious, opens early and closes late, has good coffee, offers free (tap) water bottles, and has enough outlets."
40,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I stumbled upon this place after a visit to the cinema on a thursday afternoon. Very nice chill vibe, open space, perfect for a bit of work or drinks. Did not have any food so can't comment on that. Staff was super nice and friendly."
41,Kanarie Club, 1 star ,4 years ago,We went last Tuesday for a dinner there but we regretted every minute of it. We waited more than a hour for the main courses and when they came they were so small that anywhere else they would not qualify even as starters. We left so hungry that we had to grab a snack next door.
42,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The portions are not big indeed, but the""surprise menu"" was fantastic! Awesome experience! The place is really nice, the staff is also absolutely awesome. Thank you!"
43,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great location, vibe & drinks! The vegetable juice was quite savoury. And such an Instagrammable place as well ;) Love it"
44,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice location BUT the waitresses where kinda annoyed that we wanted to order something and not just sit quietly there and I expected a better quality of the drinks.
45,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Really great on the inside with the bars and the pool area. Food was ok. Not bad but very greasy because of poor kitchen work. Rather go to the foodhall next door.
46,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice cosy place to have some drink.
47,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Staff is very friendly. Most of the tables have power plugs. Drinks and food are very good. A little expensive though. WiFi is not very fast

49,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious, safe, convenient"
50,Kanarie Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Way too expensive for what you‚Äôre getting. 18‚Ç¨ for deer steak (2 mini slices without any veggies).
51,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good location with relative good value for drinks. Parla was sublime and provided an excellent service not just for me, but for all the guest that I did see."

53,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and beer!
54,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Best part of the food halls. More relaxed atmosphere than the other side of the hall and better quality of air.
55,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good vibe, great service, slightly limited brunch options but still worth a visit"
56,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lots of different options and everything is done through phone, from ordering to paying. Really nice experience ü§ì"
57,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very, very good food. Small portions but excellent quality. Highly recommended."

60,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy spot for cocktails and snacks
61,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Have been there only once. Looked empty. I don't drink alcohols so can't judge the place. We were at the bar in the middle with stand up tables.
62,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place to visit,  we have a light lunch and a glass of wine. Worth a visit"
63,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice surroundings but service slow (bar staff should spend time serving and not chatting up clientele) and lacks atmosphere of next door Foodhallen.
64,Kanarie Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place with beautiful decorations and cozy atmosphere. However, the staff is rude and very inefficient!"
65,Kanarie Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing venue, very nice staff, nice atmosphere!! Definitely going again :)"
66,Kanarie Club, 1 star ,4 years ago,Worst service I've encountered in a really long time. Waiter was annoying and rude and the food was nothing more special than MacDonalds of Burger King
67,Kanarie Club, 1 star ,4 years ago,Overrated and disappointing. Nice vibe and inner decoration but overpriced for ok-ish food.
68,Kanarie Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, just a pity that the outside terrace closes early and is not serviced."
69,Kanarie Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,You can wait forever for a waiter to come and give you a menu. Waited 5 mins and gave up and left!
70,Kanarie Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nice dinner atmosphere but food was very average and overpriced
71,Kanarie Club, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Wait times too long plus the food not worth the waiting at all. This was with lunch, maybe it is different in the evening."
