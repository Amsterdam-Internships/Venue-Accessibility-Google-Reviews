0,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Lovely spot to work. I combine my meetings in Amsterdam with half a day of working here.
Lunch @Lotti‚Äôs is good. ‚Ä¶"
1,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Centrally located. Buzzing with young and international people. With good music but still lets you hear the conversation of people at your table. Recommended for an afternoon tea away from the touristic crowds.
2,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,6 months ago,We were nicely greeted and welcomed by a staff named Chris and he made sure we were always taken care of at the table. The atmosphere of the restaurant is cosy and we really enjoyed the dishes we had. We will definitely come back.
3,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Love this place! It is cozy and the food is amazing. If you want to go there for working/studying I would advice to go early in the morning, otherwise it can get a bit noisy. They have a good selection of wines and cocktails and the staff ‚Ä¶"
4,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Very nice place, and well located with possibility for view over the canals of Amsterdam. Suitable for drinks and dining. In my experience, dishes fell a bit short to expectations, but still enjoyable. For more experiences like this follow @quiquinnv"
5,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Overall good experience, however, we waited 20 mins to be seated (even though we had a reservation) then were seated in a hallway table which seemed to be added. ‚Ä¶"
6,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"The worst experience ever. We didn't know where to go and the host didn't bother to help us out, then we had to wait 30 minutes before receiving our table after chasing them down to give us a proper table because we had made a reservation, but the shocking thing is that none of them were remorseful; like they were doing us a favor."
7,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"The atmosphere is really great here, it feels super relaxed and the furniture gives it a cool living room vibe. The food is pretty decent and very affordable compared to other lunch places in the city. And the kombucha is delicious!"
8,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I've been here a couple of times now and the service is always excellent. The brunch menu lacks a bit of flavour, would be great if they could incorporate more herbs and spices into their dishes. The quality of cocktails is a little inconsistent, but flavour-wise okay"
9,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very chill place but usually very crowded on weekends. The service can be a bit slow. The coffee is average and so is the food. Bare in mind it‚Äôs a restaurant of a hotel and so the prices are a bit higher and the value of the price not so ‚Ä¶
10,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Part of the Hoxton Hotel and meets all the expected design and style points. The menu is great, obviously we'll composed by professionals that know what people want with classics and comfort food the satisfy. No complexity, execution is good bit not life changing. The truffle fries are a guilty pleasure you shouldn't skip!"
11,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent! Was walking along the canal and stopped for a drink as there was a table outside. Great gin selection with Dutch gins and wines too. Great people watching spot too. Didn‚Äôt know they had dinner until I went to the bathroom and ‚Ä¶
12,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Nice breakfast options and affordable prices. Great place to go to for a small breakfast or brunch.
13,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Pretty expensive, tasteless avocado toast. In my taste the pancakes were way too sweet but my boyfriend liked them so idk."
14,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 1 star ,a month ago,We did the winter wonder walk and I was really looking forward to the experience. Unfortunately lottis was an extreme letdown as we paid 6 euros for 3 little pancakes with some syrup and cinnamon. I believe theyre normally 14 euros which is ridiculous for even a restaurant in the middle of Amsterdam.
15,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great view if you get a table outside. Coffee is super. Didn't eat so not sure on the food!
16,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Food is great, place looks lovely and the waiters are super friendly."
17,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We had a fantastic lunch today at Lotti‚Äôs. Great food and spot on cocktails! I don‚Äôt remember when was the last time I had a perfect espresso martini‚Ä¶. Congrats to the bar tender! Loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è
18,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Excuse the ugly photo but the current fried chicken popup is amazing. We got the sandwich and Mac & cheese and were very happy. We called ahead since we were in a rush and it was ready when we got there in 10 minutes. Lastly the service ‚Ä¶
19,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 1 star ,4 months ago,Eh this place is overpriced and mediocre. You‚Äôre basically paying for the location I guess? If you‚Äôre one of those chicks that carries designer bags and likes to photograph her food though I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love it. Service was a mix of ok ‚Ä¶
20,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Prime location, lovely view of a not too crowded canal. There's room for improvement with the food, but the general experience is pleasant."
21,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"On the first glance all good. But food has average taste + I feel like waiters randomly pick up food from the open kitchen. We were waiting for a cake for like 20 mins, it was there all ready on a kitchen table, but nobody was picking it up ‚Ä¶"
22,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Unfriendly staff (especially the guy checking your qr code at the entrance), we were sitting by the hotel lift where a lot of people were walking by us. The cocktails were good but then asked for wine advice and the person completely failed ‚Ä¶"
23,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"If you plan to stay in Amsterdam, Lotti‚Äôs is a special place where you can enjoy very nice and good food in an ambience of contemporary music; they have a nice list of wines and champagne. Easily accessible by tram. I loved it!"
24,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious! You clearly notice that a new chef is at the helm of the kitchen! The new menu of Restaurant Lotti‚Äôs is clearly different and the food is great!
25,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, stylish and fun, the brunch was amazing and the stuff super helpful. The interior design is very cool and every Sunday from 16:00 to 19:30 you can enjoy live jazz music"
26,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"seems like they have issues with staff. long waiting time.
when I asked some sugar waiter brought empty sugar dispenser. thanks bro, nice joke. ‚Ä¶"
27,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy atmosphere with lots of room. Breakfast menu is great, everything is delicious and the staff are very nice. The Avo Poached Eggs on Soda bread is a must"
28,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to stop by having a coffee or drink after walking around in Amsterdam. It gets busy so might be hard to get a table. They had a live jazz band on the Sunday we went
29,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic spot for a slightly more authentic (if high end) Dutch meal. Lots of local meats, cheeses, fish, and veggies. The beer list was a little short, but still had some great selections. ‚Ä¶"
30,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Design of the hotel, the ambience and location are the best parts of the experience. The food is average although it is dressed nicely. Service was average and lacking hospitality, which is ironic as it is a hotel."
31,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great place for drinks. Nice ambiance and perfect to relax or go with a date. Service is good for the most part but can be slow.
32,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice and cosy atmosphere, located on herengracht close to 9 straatjes. Lovely service and good food. Try homemade lemonade and truffle fries. Delicious!"
33,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good restaurant. We passed new year's eve here, and it was fantastic. Good service. The food is exquisite. Would definitely come again."
34,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Casual lounge area in the front of the restaurant, diner atmosphere in the middle of the restaurant and a romantic room in the rear.  The wait staff is very friendly and the food is very good.  It is the best dinner I have had in Europe in ‚Ä¶"
35,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very delicious food
Especially liked the cajun chicken & French onion soup"
36,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We have had an amazing night. Gareth made sure that everything was okay. He gave us a very cozy spot. We could ask him anything and he made sure we would get that. He arranged firework because it was my birthday. The food was delicious, the ‚Ä¶"
37,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We had an amazing evening at Lottis' at The Hoxton in Amsterdam. The cocktail menu is innovative and surprising, and the classics on point. service on the terrace was attentive and with a smile. In the restaurant alike, Charlotte and Malia ‚Ä¶"
38,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very nice play with good food, tasty cocktails and awesome music!!!"
39,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I come here for the atmosphere, but stay for the awesome fermented drinks and food. The crew honestly make you feel so welcome it really does become your second home if you're a regular. But please, try their wide range of self made fermented drinks like their kombucha and tepache. So good!"
40,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Modern and industrial deco with intimate and dimmed lighting. The restaurant serves a varied menu where veggie and vegan options are well indicatedüå±.
It also has a great bar with top class cocktails and good atmosphere. Staff is ‚Ä¶"
41,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,a year ago,"It's really not worth it to spend your time and money there..The place is nicely located, at Herengracht, walking distance from CS, has sits outside. Unfortunately, food/cocktails quality and price do not match at all! Vegan burger for 18‚Ç¨ ‚Ä¶"
42,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Loved the food and the friendly service here! Very nice interior, open kitchen. A calm place in the buzzing city.‚ù§Ô∏è"
43,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cocktails are great & food is amazing! We tried the pheasant and grilled octopus and both dishes were incredible. The cheese platter has a good selection and is plated beautifully with interesting pairings for the cheese, but I still think ‚Ä¶"
44,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the most wonderful time - the food was delicious and so well priced. I searched so many restaurants to find a reasonable deal and came across Lotti‚Äôs. Considering how incredibly busy it was, the food was fast and so fresh. We also ‚Ä¶"
45,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The nice atmosphere, great space and comfortable chairs could make the place awesome, maybe for a drink it's enough. However we went for dinner and the good first impression didn't wait too much to get away. The food it's not good, or at ‚Ä¶"
46,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice atmosphere with good service and drinks. Suggestion: those spotlights on the top floor are killing the vibe, kill them! Too much ice in the cocktails."
47,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A welcoming modern eclectic space just across from the ‚Äò9 streets‚Äô shopping area and close to city center. Stumbled in after a day of traveling for a quick drink and a bite that was totally worth it. Staff was friendly and suggestive on the ‚Ä¶
48,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food and service
Elegant and welcoming
Pricing is reasonable especially considering the quality.
Thanks"
49,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there for drinks on a Sunday to enjoy live jazz music, which turned out to be a great experience. Listening to this music while the sun goes down and next to the canals is wonderful. As a suggestion for improvement, it seemed that ‚Ä¶"
50,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Average food but good relaxed atmosphere. Staff was friendly and helpful.
51,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This is our usual brunch place, the location is amazing. It is packed almost all the time during weekend but we always managed to find d table.
The chicken sandwich, toastie, Thai style noodlea and the chef menu all great.
Will continue going there 8/10 for me"
52,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice place. A lot of space, for sure u will find a free table. Great coffee. Like it!"
53,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Overall verdict: Underwhelming.

The staff here are great, very conscientious, well mannered, and attentive. ‚Ä¶"
54,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We stayed at the Hoxton and ordered room service a few times from Lotti's. The food was delicious, generous portions, and they were very accommodating to my food allergies. The food is more on the side of American hipster food. Things like ‚Ä¶"
55,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice restaurant. Waiters have been really nice and the food was great. We all took the how burger and it was worth it. ‚Ä¶
56,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Located in the Hoxton Hotel on Herengracht canal, just a few minutes walk from Dam Square, there's not much which gives away the existence of this Cafe Bar & Grill. Largely thanks to word of mouth, Lotti's has become one of the trendiest ‚Ä¶"
57,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,3 years ago,We ordered some bread and a bottle of wine and 2 main courses with some sides. Our main course came ~4 minutes later than the bread and even before the bottle of wine. The mains were somewhat disappointing. It took a long time before they ‚Ä¶
58,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a great night at Lotti‚Äôs last night. Started out with cocktails in the bar area after being welcomed by a super friendly host and only got better from there. Good atmosphere, great food and really nice staff!"
59,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great cocktails and good food. Limited lunch menu, but enough to fill you up while you drink. Expect to be asked to leave if there is a dinner reservation in your particular sitting spot. The staff is friendly and will accommodate as best they can."
60,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lotti's at The Hoxton is a fantastic spot: rain, hail, or shine. The cafe and bar is so cosy when it's cold and rainy and the well-lit restaurant makes you feel like you are outside. They now have some tables for 2 on the street to allow ‚Ä¶"
61,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great staff for sure! But unfortunately the food - even on the third try - is just average, especially for the price. The Mac and cheese was too liquid, the steak was first overdone, second time it was ordered medium but arrived half medium ‚Ä¶"
62,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely meal, even easier when we were staying in the hotel."
63,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 1 star ,a year ago,"Half the menu wasn't available to order, bruschetta was an insult to the Italian kitchen, burger was too raw and the cr√®me br√ªl√©e was burnt to a crisp.
Would not recommend coning here."
64,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was good and nicely designed restaurant. Unfortunately the service and wait between courses was extremely slow.
65,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The location and building is beautiful and comfy. Great for business meetings to work while you eat or a more intimate meet up. My coworker had the caeser salad with chicken and I had two poached eggs on avocado toast. Although the service ‚Ä¶
66,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,3 years ago,They say you cannot judge a book by its cover.  No place proves that more than Lotti's. ‚Ä¶
67,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I went there with my boyfriend to grab a drink on a Saturday afternoon. Great life Jazz music, very cosy atmosphere and good service. Perfect place to chill, although it was quite crowded. If you want to grab a spot, you should come early."
68,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Really love the vibe here, so comfy and cozy. They do breakfast very well and the coffee is best I've have yet in Amsterdam - get the steamed oat milk on the side. Service is spotty so don't be shy in waving down one of the waitstaff."
69,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. We had average burgers and drinks with a group of 7. They unfortunately really overcharge on the drinks (medium beer 8 euros) and the food is too expensive for what you get. Service was friendly. Place is clearly made for tourists
70,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The food was good! There's an efficiency that's good but not as relaxed as most Dutch run restaurants. The manger was circling and hovering like a hawk and the staff was clearing even our water when we were talking. This was after the lunch rush and this was not so enjoyable.
71,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was ok - tasty and fresh, though it was rather overpriced compared to some outstanding quality places in the city. What made truly bad impression to me though was the service - not attentive at all, and in my opinion quite rude. I ‚Ä¶"
72,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Went for lunch and had delicious bavette steak and bbq eggs. Place is lovely inside and had a nice atmosphere. The waitress was also very attentive and helpful with sampling the beers on tap.
73,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, although they are a bit pushy for you to order more. Had a foul tasting cappuccino there, for the ridiculous price of 4,10! Cappuccino used to be good here, but I won't go back there anytime soon. The menu is incredibly overpriced."
74,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the few places where they still keep in mind the important stuff! Red wine in a huge glass!!! Notice in NL recently is hard to drink red wine in a proper glass, maybe is a problem of space üòÇ... There they got a great menu and great service!"
75,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is the best place in Amsterdam to go for a great drink before dinner or the last night cap of the evening.  The cocktails are creative, tasty and compared to other cocktail bars in the area, very reasonably priced.  The Aloe There and ‚Ä¶"
76,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Friendly but incredibly slow service. We sat in the lounge area and all our glasses were empty. Took them ages to bring new drinks and it wasn't even that busy. We canceled our reservation we had for dinner and went elsewhere.
77,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"After visiting Lotti's for lunch, we received an email why we didn't show up and that they've missed us. Well Dear people @Lotti's, we felt like you missed us, because we did check in. We got Seated and then nothing happened. We had to ask ‚Ä¶"
78,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Very relaxing environment in the middle of Amsterdam Center. One of the best places along Herengracht. Place is very cozy (retro sofas, books etc) with affordable prices. For ex. filtered coffee is EUR 2.5. Great!"
79,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,6 years ago,This is the restaurant inside the Hoxton hotel. All the effort seems to have gone on design rather than food or service. The menu is reassuringly short but the food is over cooked and reheated. The squid was over cooked and smothered in a ‚Ä¶
80,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favorite dining places, great atmosphere, friendly staff, wide selection of menu. Sides are a bit too big (mac and cheese for example), so you can consider sharing."
81,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,For the most romantic dates üòç I really like this place a lot
82,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 1 star ,2 years ago,"1 star is generous! worst service I‚Äôve ever experienced, rude staff, we had to get up and ask to order our drinks and food, they constantly ignored us. We arrived at 8pm to get our mains at 10pm!! Really, really aweful, please don‚Äôt waste your money here! Such a shame had high hopes."
83,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super chill bar and restaurant with a cafe vibe. Staff was incredibly friendly. Food was amazing and came out so quick! Glad we found walking along the canal.
84,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely atmosphere not too far from the Damstraat and Dam Square. High level staff and bar tenders. Better in winter than summer (is a closed place). Cool opening window up your head.
85,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,a year ago,Have been to Lotti's numerous times and every time it's great. Laid back atmosphere with great food and service. Will definitely be back!
86,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"staff was average, nothis special
food was bad. good intention, but bad. poached egg was a hard boiled egg. eggs royal come on a HARD bagel ‚Ä¶"
87,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"This place was fabulous for concept. But I managed to order a Grey goose on the rocks away from the bar. And my pelegrino bottle wasn't opened for me, and I still don't have a napkin. ‚Ä¶"
88,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food is very well presented. Taste ok. The wait time ruined the experience: 40 minutes before getting the first course and 55 minutes after that for the main course.
89,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place was lovely. Great food with plenty to choose from. Slightly on the pricy side but would recommend.
They do breakfast too if your looking for that"
90,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice spot for brunch. The outside of the hotel belies the space and cosiness on offer inside.. friendly staff decent good nice  layout.
91,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Breakfast is great here. In the evening it's a super cool place to hang for a drink, but trying to get a second round, you could be waiting a while..."
92,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place and service. Food was good but not great. Atmosphere was ideal for a Friday buzzy but not crazy busy
93,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A good palace to have a relaxing if slightly expensive breakfast. The breakfast sauge while flavorful is a but on the dry side.
94,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great dinner and dessert. The vegetarian pasta with mashroom is very tasty. The chocolate dessert is amazing
95,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice lounge cafe and bar.

Highly recommended for brunch :)"
97,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, excellent service."
98,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nothing Dutch about the place. Hipster atmosphere. Overpriced mediocre food. Feels like a tourist trap.

102,Lotti‚Äôs Dinner, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cup a Joe cocktail is phenomenal. Food is good, but not outstanding. Service is great!"
