1,Royalvis & Traiteur, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"You choose which fresh seafood you want and they cook it on the spot for you. I've never been to a place like it. Their fish soup was very popular, it comes with a slice of lemon and a piece of delicious french bread. Nice outdoor dining as well."
2,Royalvis & Traiteur, 4 stars ,6 months ago,I ordered the shoarma and baklava. It was quite good although there were some undercooked pieces of shoarma. The pricing is pretty decent here.

23,Royalvis & Traiteur, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Decent place. The ambiance gives off an earthy feel-good vibe. The food is simply to die for. The appetizers must be sprinkled with crack because I just craved for more and more. The service was good for the most part but the waiter was a bit air-headed.
