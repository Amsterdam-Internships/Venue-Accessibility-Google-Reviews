183,Bakers & Roasters, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Small and cosy place great for breakfast or brunch with plenty of variations. Downside was that reservations were not possible and we were placed on a waitlist for about 30 to 45 minutes during which we wandered throughout the neighbourhood. Not ideal since it as raining slightly, hence just four stars."
184,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You fall in love the moment you enter! Seated by super friendly staff, you get to choose between exciting and super exciting meals including veggie options. I can't even say how the served earl grey made me happy! There are of course ‚Ä¶"

We could place our reservation in front of the restaurant, came back after 1 hour when a table was free. They wrote us a message when the table was ready. I would go there again, good quality of food!"
189,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very friendly service and great breakfast/brunch dishes. Leave some space for a piece of their great cakes! The carrot cake was delicious.

196,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We stayed in this part of Amsterdam for four days and ate breakfast here for three of them, so I think that says a lot about how much we loved this place. Great coffee, incredible food (we got to try lots of it!) and wonderful service. Get here shortly after they open and there‚Äôs no wait!"
197,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for breakfast. So good we went there twice in our 4 day stay in Amsterdam. Good variety of dishes to try and blueberry pancakes were a big hit for our two year old.
198,Bakers & Roasters, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Good food and good service, though perhaps a bit slow, and typical Amsterdam prices. You might forget you're in the Netherlands considering the non-Dutch speaking staff. But in the Netherlands we are, and printing ""service is not included"" on the check is insupportable."
199,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic little spot, similar to the cafe's back home in Melbourne. Good coffee, good food. Yesterday had the Eggs Royale, this morning I had the B&R special. Both are good! Perfect poached eggs 2 days in a row, fresh bread and friendly, energetic staff. Highly recommend."

201,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice ausi-atmosphere. Great breakfast and friendly staff. Healthy food. Highly recomended. The 'please wait to be seated' sign outside (really in front of the door) should be ignored. I stood there for many minutes without knowing whether I could come in or not.
202,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is such a good example of an Australian / Kiwi breakfast right in the heart of Europe! The prices are decent and you have choice of sweet, savoury, hot and cold dishes! It's also the best coffee that I've had in the Netherlands! The staff are so nice - I went for breakfast twice once morning"
203,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"After a few weeks in Europe we were keen for a decent flat white and a fluffy and were happy with the result. Great speedy service, clean and cute decor and good food. Plenty of mini marshmallows for the babycino was a winner."

212,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super delicious food, very friendly staff and price is for location and dish size totally acceptable. It was pretty crowded when we went. They put us on a waiting list and we got a text message when a table was free. Because it was so ‚Ä¶"
213,Bakers & Roasters, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Decent food out of a very stereotypical modern Anglo-Saxon breakfast menu, this is what I would expect to get from a caf√© in London or NYC. Service is generally good. The place looks good, but when I visited there was always a big crowed. Long waiting queues mostly formed of foreigners living in the city or just visiting."
214,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Staff were very kind and welcoming. The food was fresh and light. Music was tasteful and the decor was distinctly New Zealand. ‚Ä¶

217,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great brunch place.  Kiwi inspired brunch that is quite delicious.  Had the Kiwi Brekkie, and that's a full plate of food.

218,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Great coffee, friendly people."
219,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect brunch food and always served with a smile, whenever we have visitors this is always on the list of places to take them, although probably just as much an excuse for us to go back. The Navajo eggs are a personal favourite and the peanut butter & banana cake is ridiculous."

222,Bakers & Roasters, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I got the eggs benedict dish here which was pretty good and they have amazing coffee. It's a little on the pricey side and the wait can be too long sometimes. But I highly recommend it if you're looking for some ""Americanized"" breakfast in Amsterdam."
223,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Incredible food and great service. There was no table available when we arrived but they booked us in for 20 minutes and sent us a text when the table was ready. Food was perfectly cooked for everyone and coffee was great too.
224,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful food - so tasty!

227,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Want to experience a real Australian taste?! Go visit Bakers and Roasters! Make sure you have enough time because there is always a cue. It won't take to long but you know what they say : if it's good you have to wait for it ;) ‚Ä¶
228,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great selection of breakfast/brunch specials in addition to an interesting list of both alcoholic & nonalcoholic drinks. Very efficient service. Wait time for a table is hit or miss. Yesterday 0 minutes, but today 20 minutes.  Well worth any reasonable wait time."
229,Bakers & Roasters, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food and coffee and really kind service. We loved it so much we went back the next day. The wait for food (later in the morning) was a little long but completely worth it; go closer to when they open and it‚Äôs less busy

242,Bakers & Roasters, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Owned by a Brazilian and Kiwi guy this place is an interesting fusion. The food is also a nice blend of standard dishes with a funny twist. Don't expect to meet locals here - this is the place where you go to when you are in need of a new insta post.
243,Bakers & Roasters, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Only downside, I think it's pretty expensive. But that banana nut bread french toast is the best breakfast/brunch food I had in a while.
