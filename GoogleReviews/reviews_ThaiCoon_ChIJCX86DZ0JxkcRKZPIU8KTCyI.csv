7,ThaiCoon, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Very nice papaya salad and they did a wonderful job on the tofu, which seemed to be grilled first. Mains were spicy and full of fresh ingredients. Only points of comment: only cash (come on guys, it's 2021). And we had to wait long for the main course. Besides that, service with a smile and good Thai food."
8,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just two weeks after coming back from Thailand I ended up eating at a Thai restaurant in Amsterdam. In my mind I already imagined a boring dinner with the same old Thai food, but I must admit, this place came to surprise me. The Pad Thai with shrimp was not only delicious, but also probably the biggest Pad Thai dish that I ever had."

24,ThaiCoon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very good Thai food with plenty of Thai vegetables and herbs. Large portions at reasonable prices. Only downside is the restaurant itself - a chaotic and stressful experience. Best to take out and enjoy at home.
