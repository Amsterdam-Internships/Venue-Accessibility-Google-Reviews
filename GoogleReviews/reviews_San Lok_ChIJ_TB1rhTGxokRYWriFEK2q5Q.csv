0,San Lok, 1 star ,6 months ago,First they are overrated.  Poor customer service!! Absolutely not the best Chinese food! No forks no napkins!!!!
1,San Lok, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Awesome! Best Chinese take out in the city. The wonton soup is amazing!
2,San Lok, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Place doesn't look as good as their food. Long-standing family run business. Chicken wings seasoned perfectly u don't need to add extra seasonings. I absolutely love their shrimp and chicken fried rice with gravy!!!!! their food rice is authentic Chinese fried rice.
3,San Lok, 5 stars ,a year ago,"San Lok doesn‚Äôt look pretty from the outside, but the food is ALWAYS delicious and the portions are huge. there is always something different included in your standard dishes. i love lo mein but it usually tastes the same everywhere. here they do something different and add more veggies and it always hits the spot!"
4,San Lok, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has been around for many, many years. Family owned I'm sure... I moved away, haven't been in over 15 years. Happen to be in the area so we stopped by. It didn't disappoint. Food is consistently GOOD! Not in the best neighborhood but it's right across from a police station."
5,San Lok, 5 stars ,2 years ago,They have these broccoli shrimp rolls with cheese inside. There great..  Cheese Steak rolls great also... Great food period... Best hood chinese store around 40 years strong...
