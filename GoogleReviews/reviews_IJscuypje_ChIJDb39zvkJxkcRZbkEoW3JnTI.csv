0,IJscuypje, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice ice cream shop chain with a wide variety of flavors. Pretty good flavor and texture. Itâ€™s tasty. The staff was very nice, polite and fast attention. You can find both Water based and milk based ones but all of them are great. Scones and cups, small ones and also big ones:"
