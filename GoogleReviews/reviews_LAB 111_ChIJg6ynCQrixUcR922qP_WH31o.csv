0,LAB 111, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great art-house movie theatre, in the old Pathological-Anatomical Lab. Often has a mix of more alternative and classic movies. Off the beaten track in Amsterdam West. Has a really nice bar with good beers and seating as well."
1,LAB 111, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"The LAB111 theater is located in a quiet and pleasant area, the inside is designed with this vintage artsy vibe. Cool drink area before the start of the movie, and the movie screen is a nice size to enjoy the movie. ‚Ä¶"
2,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a month ago,"A beautiful cinema/bar/restaurant artsy atmosphere, stunning decoration & friendly staff, one of West Amsterdam best kept secret üíé"
3,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"As a cinema this is an amazing venue for movie aficionados, there is a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The seats are comfortable enough and the screen is clear and large to see everything well on. ‚Ä¶"
4,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Best staff ever ‚ú® lin and sonny are amazing bartenders !!!!! i wish i could live here (sometimes it felt like i did)
5,LAB 111, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Always nice movies/documentaries available that you possibly can't find somewhere else in big screen.
Cute place with a nice bar too, great vibe."
6,LAB 111, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"So I just went to go for a movie and a drink. And ended up staying for dinner. What an unexpected and pleasant surprise, great food and great drinks! And real ginger beer, not ginger ale, but ginger beer. Have the movie and main course deal for ‚Ç¨20 and save yourself ‚Ç¨6 euros."
7,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Lovely small cinema with friendly, likable staff, great selection, and fun atmosphere. ‚Ä¶"
8,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great place for creative people. Theatre, music and movie lovers. Don't forget the food and drinks."
9,LAB 111, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Watched Lost in Translation here, sadly the film was so dimly lit by the projector that the already soft colors became even more desaturated. A great amount of detail was lost. You're better off watching the blu-ray at home. It's my favorite film too. Dissapointing."
10,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place has a great vibe. The cinema was cozy and it has unique selection of movies. I definitely Will be back for more movies and drinks
11,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A cosy arthouse cinema nestled in the cosiest quarter of Amsterdam: the Wilhelmina Gasthuis. Apart from a wonderful mix of classic and contemporary films, Lab111 also boasts a wonderful bar/caf√© and pretty regular cultural events. ‚Ä¶"
12,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Probably the best movie rooms in Amsterdam! The bar is also a must!
13,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favourite art house movie theatres. Great atmosphere, nice food, cool architecture and fantastic movie selections. Love it!"
14,LAB 111, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"You have to buy a ticket in advance. If you don't it's unlikely you get a spot. If you are 15 minutes late, they won't let you in anymore and your money is gone. Terrible system. Otherwise it's proce but a decent cinema."
15,LAB 111, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Plain awful service, with an exceptional arrogant and stubborn receptionist, out of any flexibility and integrity. We were in the theatre 5 minutes later after the movie started, during a movie festival. They had two receptionists, ‚Ä¶"
16,LAB 111, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Ok venue, but the always rude and disinterested staff ruin the experience. Plenty of other, cooler cinemas in town, this is one to avoid."
17,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing cinema and cafe - nice beers and delicious pizza!
18,LAB 111, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Amazing place, amazing cinema. Also the food and drinks service during the movie was amazing. Popcorn super salty tho"
19,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I adore this place. Very nice vibe and indie crowd. Also a great selection of films. Check what room your movie is in! LAB 1 is great with a huge screen, but LAB 2 is a very small screen with only ~30 seats"
20,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,LAB111 was a super interesting place. Loved it how they turned an actual laboratory to an artistic place which is open for different cultural events. Inside they have a very cool bar too. There is so much to be fascinated by this amazing place. I was there for a festival and totally loved it.
21,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely beautiful alternative space. Love the passionate feeling towards art that this place have. Absolutely hidden gem and I frickin love it. You should watch some older movie there, the one that they don't play in cinemas anymore.
‚ô•Ô∏è"
22,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Been here 5 times now and the food has been consistently high quality each time. ‚Ä¶
23,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This review is for the bar, which is what we visited.

What a cool place. It was totally our vibe and we just really loved the scene, ‚Ä¶"
24,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The movies they show are great and very good concept in general. But, and the reason for the rating is, that the seats are awfully uncomfortable for watching a two hours movie. Also the sound quality could be improved. We would love to ‚Ä¶"
25,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,Sometime free projection and nice place to see a movie üé• thanks a lot
26,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fantastic venue for the cinema! The bar located at the Lab is also fantastic with an excellent choice of local beers. They just finished some renovations and it looks great! Friendly staff as well.
27,LAB 111, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Love the LAB 111 movie sessions, selection, theaters, drinks.. love!"
28,LAB 111, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Always nice movies (especially when Miyazaki' are broadcasted) with a lovely bar. I highly recommend!
29,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favorite places in West. The theater is small, but it has a cozy vibe that only an independent cinema can offer. You can have a good dinner after the movie in ‚ÄúStrange Love‚Äù, a restaurant in the same premise."
30,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Thank you for hosting a Japanese food workshop, I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏èüèØ"
31,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A very nice small scale cinema with a beautiful restaurant that serves amazing food. I've tried the vegetarian burger and couldn't tell if I was eating meat or not... It was delicious! It was real fun to combine a Kill Bill with a dinner at Lab111. Order and reserve the tickets online and be prepared for a great evening!
32,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect for a low key ""dinner and a movie"" night in Amsterdam. The cinema mostly shows cult, classics, arthouse cinema movies (always with English subtitles), and the restaurant selection may be a bit small but still accommodates many diets. Love this place and its unique charm!"
33,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous alternative movie venue. Good wine, great location, cool choice of films! #westwood"
34,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The venue is very well done with nice art installations around the building. The cafe had a good selection of beers as well as good. LAB 2 was a bit small but made for a cozy screening. Will definitely be back for more movies
35,LAB 111, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly staff, always offering free tea, coffee and water. Comfortable and spacious cinema but 'zaal 2' is a little less comfortable, spacious and uses a beamer instead of a projector"
36,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice, different type of cinema with its own climate. The projection rooms are not too big, you can definitely feel it is much more private than in the large cinemas. There is also a bar, where you can have coffee or beer afterwards. Definitely worth visiting!"
37,LAB 111, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place when you get the big screen. Good movie selections. They need to take better care with technical setups: masking different aspect ratios properly and adjusting the sound levels/brightness when screening older films. When a film is too quiet or not masked properly, I might as well just download the film and see it from home."
38,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice Place!
They need some paintings on da wall!"
39,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It‚Äôs a brilliant space, the building is old and dusty and has a boarding house feel. The cinema seats creak and the range of movies on show demonstrate a lot of care and interest. And what‚Äôs more, the bar has a good mix of beers. I‚Äôd recommend for movie lovers and cinema freaks."
40,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This place seems to really know it‚Äôs audience. Local and international film goers who are young and culturally aware. Great series of films, great community aspect, but one star down because the theater seating is a disaster. They could do to invest in replacing old seats that have been broken."
41,LAB 111, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very hipster location showing a different range of films. Nice spot, but not the comfiest or most spacious seats. Would be good spot to work from during the day and then catch up with friends in the evening over drinks and a film. Will go back"
42,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Only been once but will be going again soon and getting a membership. I went to see your name which was really nice and stuck with me (the sign of a good movie). There's a really nice bar where I had a coffee and cool posters on the wall of ‚Ä¶
43,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The best cinema of the Netherlands. Filmsüëç
44,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool place , good movie programming. Super tasty food . And lovely staff."
45,LAB 111, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great local film house, varied program, nice bar selection, friendly."
46,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This cinema has a cozy interior. The food is generally quite good, and the seating in the cafe area is more spacious than I expected, though not large per se. The best part of the place, in my humble opinion, is that they host something ‚Ä¶"
47,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"They can do a better job related to the queuing. You have to get in to a queue in front of the door since they have free seating policy. However, there is no designated queuing area or someone to manage the line. Therefore, people cut in ‚Ä¶"
48,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favourite theatres in Amsterdam. Not only do they play current films, but they offer screenings of all-time classics and favourites. From Rocky Horror, to special screening schedules dedicated to one actor or director, there's always a film I'm looking forward to at this place"
49,LAB 111, 5 stars ,5 months ago,great japanese movie. room was packed though.
50,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super quirky spot in an old school/lab building for seeing a great selection of indie movies and classics. The bar is cool and staff friendly. Go check out some David Lynch films soon :)
51,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great social place to meet (new) friends, dates, have a drink or a bite, although I must say that the food portion and taste were a let down. Friendly staff though. Make sure to check out what films are screening. This is a classic Dutch hybrid cultural center meets eetcafe."
52,LAB 111, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Beautiful atmosphere and a great selection of movies! Highly recommended!
53,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very fun little cinema with all kinds of movies. This summer there's a Studio Ghibli special which I love because I love a good anime movie! There's also lots of classics and new art house flicks being shown so It a definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of movies. The restaurant right next is really good too!
54,LAB 111, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The selection of movies and the complex in general is nice. However, the cinema hall was smaller than my living room with just 4 rows of hard chairs, compromising the movie experience and comfort."
55,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The bar could be a little better stocked, the portions could be a little bigger..but the food is delicious, the staff/ service is friendly and the patrons are a great mix of locals, students, film buffs and connoiseurs of culture."
56,LAB 111, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This indie movie theater is a very cozy place. The screenings are in small rooms with foldable chairs where you can bring food and drinks from the restaurant. Interestingly enough there are no snacks being sold. The movies are either old, ‚Ä¶"
57,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Indie movies. Art house classics. I love this place - they do a ton of great events on a regular basis, and I was stoked they did a bunch of the Studio Ghibli movies over 2018. Grab a wine and enjoy :)"
58,LAB 111, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The seats are nice and the bar is stylish. I also really like the style of movies that they show. I dislike the amount of choice you have of snacks though. It feels out of place
59,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very good movie programming. Also nice to have some food. Friendly service.
And great to watch hipsters trying to be cool"
60,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Film house movie cinema with a spaceous bar. Nice, relaxing, non-impossing ambiance. Perfect place to see older movies from Hitchcock or Tarkovsky.  Also often run a theme month with all Tarantino or Kubrick movies."
61,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice cinema. Great bar. Great movies.
62,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lab111 is a very cool place, quite hidden actually. Not a lot of tourists, thankfully. The sound quality is also not that good to be hones but on the other hand there is lots of legroom. Therefore I give it 4 stars."
63,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great old stable and modern art movies, including the shocking ones. Too bad that in theater 1 the roof is so old that light gets through during the day and spoils some of the intended immersive movie experience."
64,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great underground movie theatre. Love that you can bring drinks from the bar inside. Haven‚Äôt eaten at the restaurant lately but recall it being good in years past.
65,LAB 111, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Although the location, vibe and building are awesome, room 2 was small, chairs were not that comfortable and there was an annoying hissing sound during the movie. This was very distracting and please get this fixed."
66,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great cinema with comfy seats and good restaurant for a pre-theatre meal! Shows good selection of movies. Movie and meal deal for ‚Ç¨20 is great value (meal up to ‚Ç¨15 value).
67,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Relax arthouse cinema with neat selection of cult and obscure movies.They usually host exhibitions on the lower level, and various events, talks and performances. I love the building itself which is a former anatomical laboratory!"
68,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the movie selection, quiet big screens for an indie theater, friendly staff, instagrammable interior, trendy crowd. One of my favorite cinemas now üñ§üñ§üñ§"
69,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Liquid Desserts 03 is the best sweet beer ever (11%vol.)
70,LAB 111, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a cinema plus bar, common formula here in Amsterdam. The place is managed by a student association as I understood, so that it makes it quite alternative... The cinema is one of the cineville network, so that the movies selected are always really nice and interesting..."
71,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice theater. I don't like the restaurant though and there is no popcorn. But they have very nice series of movies vased on a theme.
72,LAB 111, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good screening selection. However, the layout could have been more thoughtfully executed: I attempted to exit a thoroughly congested bar after a late night movie and it was hell. I'm not claustrophobic, but after that night... Sustained a blow to the left eye thanks to a tall Dutch elbow. Dank je wel."
73,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I meet up with a drawing group every Monday at LAB111, the house beer is pretty good though there are other selections on tap. The vibe is great and is a very comfortable environment for conversation."
74,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Went there a couple of time for movies. The movies are good and the staff are friendly. Only downside is that it can be really cold in the zaal.
75,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The movie theatre in Lab1 lacks some chairs in good spots, they sure need to be replaced.The building is very old,however it has a great character as a building. The underground floor has some hidden gems to be discovered."
76,LAB 111, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"One of my fav, film housesüíïüíï"
77,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I love this movie theatre. They have viewing for new as well as old movies. The best part of this theatre is the quality of picture and sound is way better than other indie theatres.
78,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute cinema showing a wonderful plethora of new films and even better: suggested favourites by it's clientele. Always worth a visit.
79,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The menu is limited and the service is a bit too casual for my taste, but what they have is good and the atmosphere is very pleasant."
80,LAB 111, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice and atmospheric place. Good little theater to enjoy a movie with a small audience with cocktails or some fantastic beers.
81,LAB 111, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent price quality ratio. Also great vegetarian options. Great service and very nice ambiance. The menu is small but that is a plus.
82,LAB 111, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food and beautiful, hip spot. Service was friendly, but very slow with lots of mix ups on the day we tried it. Worth visiting, just because of the atmosphere!"
83,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great cinema with great food. Nice eggs Benedict breakfast. Sometimes they have some nice movie theme weeks like studio glibli month.
84,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A very interesting old cinema that was originally a laboratory, they also have an amazing bar & the basement hosts exhibitions & public events and talks, the atmosphere is friendly and there is a nice vibe"
85,LAB 111, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent place but don‚Äôt take the millefeuille... it is just an ice cream sandwich with a mediocre puff pastry not the real deal. The pannacotta is excellent!
86,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely alternative cinema, playing something for everyone (we went for the Summer of Ghibli). Friendly staff. Quirky building (ex laboratory). Highly recommended."
87,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I came here on a Saturday night and it was very busy. They forgot our drinks but when they came they were nice about it and the nachos were good!
88,LAB 111, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Small and cosey cinema in a beautiful old building in a residential area. Good film programming and a nice restaurant and bar. Friendly staff.
89,LAB 111, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lived it, proper nice Sunday sundowner. Choice of film was wonderful and everyone was so cute and nice."
90,LAB 111, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great place for a smooth cinema evening and some food before or after.
91,LAB 111, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A nice place for movie and creative food. If you like subculture stuff and cult movie that‚Äôs a must go.

94,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere, nice selection of movies. Food can be a little pricey for what it is"
95,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 years ago,cute little cinema just off Kinkerstraat. Small cinema but has a lot on offer and a cute little bar if you're feeling like a beer with your movie
96,LAB 111, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great hidden Amsterdam venue. Inside you'll find a bar, restaurant and two cinema screens showing mainly art house movies."

98,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place involved in creating a more sustainable city
99,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to watch a movie, always with English subtitles. They tend to have a series of themed movies, and they take suggestions too!"
100,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They play newer films and classics. Most films have English subtitles. Great indie venue
101,LAB 111, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Not the most comfortable seats, but they show great vintage films and you can bring drinks in from the bar."
102,LAB 111, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best cinema in Amsterdam. Amazing selection of movies and friendly owners. The bar is really good too.
103,LAB 111, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I wish we had the same place in Berlin. I really like the concept and the quality of the movie theaters
