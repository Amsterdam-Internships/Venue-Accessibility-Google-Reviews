0,Chicago Social Club, 2 stars ,4 months ago,The music is meh and the staff is rude. I needed to sit down for a bit because of the lack of oxygen inside since the club was so full. Was forced to go outside even if I explained that I was waiting for someone to bring me some water and ‚Ä¶
1,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,5 months ago,No locks on toilets. Charge ‚Ç¨15 entry 1 hour before closing. The coat locker didn't work and she refused to help and said we have to pay again. Probably one of the worst club experiences I've ever had.
2,Chicago Social Club, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"One of the best clubs that you may go around midnight in Leidseplein. Cover charge is a bit high like 16 Euros but worth it. You may meet international people inside and have fun with good music. They are open until the morning if pandemic doesn't exist. To get the newest infos they share, follow them on Instagram. Proost guys. üçªüëçüèª"
3,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,The staff was extremely rude for no reason.
4,Chicago Social Club, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Cool. But not exceptional and a lot of queue.
5,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This club claims to have a ‚Äúdoor policy‚Äù but in fact has none to speak of. My girlfriend and me were allowed to enter, but our (perfectly sober) friend was denied entry for no reason. The men and women at the door kept denying him entry for ‚Ä¶"
6,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,The place is pricey and the music-environment was just meh. It would not be too bad if it weren't for the fact that the place smelled like a dozen of sumo fighters were having a rave party in an elevator. ‚Ä¶
7,Chicago Social Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The line at the entry is huge... It took us about 15 minutes to get in. The prices for the drinks are quit high considering other clubs in the area. 9 euro for a glass of mix rum&coke... Considering the fact that it is not positioned as a ‚Ä¶
8,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,5 years ago,We went there for new years eve and we couldn't choose worst... entrnace opened at   11.20pm. another 15 min spent on checking the tickets cause the system was crashing down when scanning. ‚Ä¶
9,Chicago Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly bar - nice chill vibe.  Drinks are reasonable (‚Ç¨3 beers / ‚Ç¨4 wine).  Also they have lockers and sell ear plugs in the bathroom area (‚Ç¨3 coins only).
10,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,8 years ago,"Review from the tourist:

11,Chicago Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cool spot to go clubbing,  you can also choose to chill in the Bar part.  Music varies from techno to hip-hop , disco etc.  Perfect place to meet Creatives in Amsterdam."
12,Chicago Social Club, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Currently very popular among the locals. At night they hold parties in the back and top floor (small room). ‚Ä¶
13,Chicago Social Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Went to Chicago social club on Friday night. Had a great evening..even if it wasn't hiphop which the door staff said it was so that was a shame..we had paid 15 quid each to get in so we stayed put and made the best of bad music lol üòâ. ‚Ä¶
14,Chicago Social Club, 4 stars ,a year ago,"cool music, nice ppl everything fine."
15,Chicago Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice lady by the entrance. We came around 12-1 a.m. with few people inside. Within an hour, the place was maybe too overcrowded. Not too expensive drinks, nice and young people."
16,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"It sucks! Woman in the entrance is stupid and racist. She kicked out us because she was saying that we needed to be in a guestlist and after us, 2 random guys entered without guestlist. I‚Äôll never come back there"
17,Chicago Social Club, 3 stars ,6 years ago,I was here during Halloween so by no means a regular night. However the experience was less than memorable. Staff was friendly but pretty much nothing else worth mentioning. Ok music and ok experience.
18,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,8 months ago,"High prices, rude staff. This club should have closed long long time ago."
19,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Overpriced, meh music and DJs, as well as useless self important staff. There are much better places to spend your evening. Some places are worth the queue, but I'm honestly confused why I see this place with one, maybe it's a tourist thing."
20,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Extremely rude staff at the entrace. A young lady acting like she owns the place with her guestlist in hands. Such an arrogant B*...  They didn't let me in because apparently I was a ""guy"". Hey, I'm sorry I was born a boy not a girl... Don't waste your time coming here ;)"
21,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"My friend and I went there last night, waited in the queue, the staff wasn't asking anyone if they were on the guest list, but. As soon as my friend and I are the next to go in we get asked if we are on the guest list. Really ! Straight garbage. Some how the only two black guys in the queue get asked that."
22,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I went with a friend visiting from the US, we are in our early 30s and the door manager said that the party is full of young people around 18 years and didn't let us in, so disappointing"
23,Chicago Social Club, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"This place was alright as in a ""I've got nothing better to do tonight and I'm on drugs""  situation..  My friend tried xtc here but it didn't kicked in so we left..  It's OK if you like to see straights making out aggressively"
24,Chicago Social Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,My absolute favourite place in Amsterdam. The staff the people the vibe  .. everything on point! 100% going back
25,Chicago Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This was a great place to go! Order your tickets online if there's an event and you'll skip the line. Drinks are pricey though.
26,Chicago Social Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I did not go in, I was eating in a place next door, the music playing was good and it seems that people are having a good time. I think the name has been changed to, "" I will never die sober"""
27,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,We bought tickets and we were denied entry just because the bouncer didn‚Äôt feel like it. The staff at the door were very disrespectful and aggressive. I highly don‚Äôt recommend the place.

86,Chicago Social Club, 1 star ,3 days ago,Didn‚Äôt even let us inside because it was 21+ where we saw people that were way younger going in only because they were on a list.
