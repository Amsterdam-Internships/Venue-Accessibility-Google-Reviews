1,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Really nice staff, good beers and great fries. Didnâ€™t eat anything else, but the burgers looked really delicious"
2,Urban Grill, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little Grill with best singing waiter. French fries were ok but expensive.
Large french fries more than 5 â‚¬ and Bitterballen also 5â‚¬."
3,Urban Grill, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Just ordered fries. Not bad, but portion not top big. Waiter friendly. Tasted excellent."
4,Urban Grill, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If you're into Gourmet Burgers, then this is the place. The staff were a little short and weren't all that willing to explain how ordering worked, as it was quite difficult when you're expecting to order a burger! Saying that, it was well â€¦"
5,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,3 years ago,If you're looking for a proper fresh and tasty burger... urban grill it!
6,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing tasting burgers. My friends got Irish Beef and Chicken and I got a vegetarian with fried aubergine. Very good price and staff are super friendly. Would definitely come back when in Amsterdam again!
7,Urban Grill, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The veggie Burger was pretty tasteless, oily and too expensive. Very small place to eat aswell. 16 euro for hamburger with onion and jalapenios with small fries and a soda. Should've gone to McDonalds."
8,Urban Grill, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We were their first customers. Ever. So this place is special for the two of us, but its one of those sorta affordable chips joints here in Amsterdam. And if you know how good they can taste after some green, you'll know why we loved it here."
9,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect classic burger and fries, no waiting good value"
10,Urban Grill, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Absolutely waste of money. I got irish beef burger and the beef was not even fully cooked. They don't even cook the meat manually but with an automatic machine, maybe that's why. Apart from the uncooked meat, they put at most two spoons of â€¦"
11,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing burger, it is actually the best burger I ever ate in my life !!! Plus, the chef was really nice. Super !"
12,Urban Grill, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Burgers (meat) are small, with cheap cheese and extras (mushrooms) forgotten. Fries also small. Prices way to high for what you get. With so many good burger bars around, not worth a visit !"
13,Urban Grill, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Good food but the service was really bad. The were two guys, an old and a younger, and the youngest one was the worst, super rude and disrespectful. He was swearing at us in his language (of course we could realise he was talking about us) â€¦"
14,Urban Grill, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ordered food @ Urban Grill with the whole company (20 people). Unfortunately the burgers we're cold once they arrived here. Furthermore they where not labeled and it looked like they had just made everything in a hurry. Worst company lunch we have ordered so far, would definitely not come back here."
15,Urban Grill, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I really don't recommend this shop. It was crowded, service was bad and even the food was bad. The fries where way to hard an there was no salt on them. We also had to wait 45minutes for 3 large fries! â€¦"
16,Urban Grill, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Burger far away from my expectations. Service not very friendly. I don't recommend. Easy to find a better burger (e.g. the butcher's)
17,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great burger and fries!  Loved this place...very reasonably priced as well.  It is very small but & can get crowded but it worth the wait!
18,Urban Grill, 1 star ,4 years ago,Horrible place. The man that served us was extremely rude. Save your money and go somewhere else. This place knows nothing about customer service. You pay for frozen food. You're better off going elsewhere. Bad end to our trip to Amsterdam.
19,Urban Grill, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Just another Burgershop. The fries were okay but large size and small size is the same for different price. I would not recommend it.
20,Urban Grill, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing burgers. Would recommend the sweet potatoes fries. Kinda small place, would recommend take-away"

23,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good service, taste and price for a quick burger or snack, highly recommended"
24,Urban Grill, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Just another hamburger place. Amsterdam has too many of these. Burgers were soggy, fries ok. Nithing special."
25,Urban Grill, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice service, but I didn't enjoy the burger."
26,Urban Grill, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The quality of the burger didn't match the high price I had to pay for it.
27,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food, thank you Marco for the experience and great service"
28,Urban Grill, 1 star ,4 years ago,Had 2 burgers and some drinks. I felt a bit ripped off since this is a bit of a tourist trap.
29,Urban Grill, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very Nice burgers! Amazing hospitality
30,Urban Grill, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Bit expensive but I guess this is what you get at Dam Square. Burgers are okay.
