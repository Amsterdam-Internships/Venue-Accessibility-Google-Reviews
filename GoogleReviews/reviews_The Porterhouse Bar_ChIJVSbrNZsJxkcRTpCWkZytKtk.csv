2,The Porterhouse Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Good for sport. Good for a hearty irish breakfast. Good for pints of beer and nice selection. Lots of room (especially important when there for sport). Friendly staff. Definitely a great staple.
3,The Porterhouse Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I also have been inside, but in addition I ordered something from the menu. Not the Portersteak because that's not there...(why?)  Instead I ordered thesirloin steak, a cheeseburger and a Shepard's Pie. One advice: don't go here for the ‚Ä¶"
4,The Porterhouse Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fine recently opened (sports)bar for a drink and some food. It has a pool table and tv screens to watch sport events.  Spareribs were good and quite tasty. Looming forward to see how it develops as it's still quite new. Due to the somewhat odd layout it can be sometimes hard to get the staffs attention. Will go here again tho!

9,The Porterhouse Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The salmon steak was cooked to perfection and the other meals were well presented and tasted quite good. There seems to be 3 separate sections of this restaurant,the front, back, and inside. This might have been the cause of the delay in us ‚Ä¶"

11,The Porterhouse Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good, and portions were big (we had the ribs and the shepherd's pie). Servers were excellent. It's a sports bar and TVs were on showing a soccer match we didn't have any interest in, but due to the somewhat odd layout, there are a some quiet spots without TVs on sight."
