9,Dosa, 5 stars ,a month ago,I should really appreciate their work for our own authentic Tamil Nadu food Taste. Really so tasty combo we had.
10,Dosa, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Travelled a long way to eat the dosas I‚Äôve been dreaming of, and was let down.
The dosa lacked flavour, the mine chutney was not fresh and the sambar could have been cooked longer for the flavours to come together.
The paratha was a miss too. Dominant flavour was the dough."
11,Dosa, 5 stars ,8 months ago,South Indian Comfort Food at it's best. You cannot drive by here and not try Dosa Dosa. Proper authentic Indian dosa. Perfect lunch treat. We had the Masala Dosa. Sauces and dips that accompany it were delish.
12,Dosa, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Last week, I went to the famed Dosa Dosa with several friends. The staff was quite polite, and they all came from the same place as DOSA. The masala chai is a must-try. In comparison to other European restaurants, I've never had a lovely ‚Ä¶"
13,Dosa, 5 stars ,a month ago,Would definitely recommend this place. The Dosa is not very hot and has the other mouth watering taste enhancing spices. They have improved a lot from when they started. Hope they maintain the standard. #indianfood #food

If u place an order ask the person to repeat the order and check the contents when receiving ur order. however nice lady serving was really nice to talk to and it has nice out door Indian Dhaaba look. May be good to try it once, but there is better dosa places in Dublin like Eurasia."

23,Dosa, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"The chutneys and sambar are delicious. So is the Chicken Chettinad Dosa.
The vegetarian Dosas are really not that special. Gunpowder dosa is not really gun powder dosa at all. Average in terms of flavor. Good value for money though unlike other Dosa places in the city."
24,Dosa, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"I can highly recommended this place for South Indian street food, I ordered Chettinad Spicy Chicken Dosa and Chicken Kothu Paratta.

49,Dosa, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The food is absolutely delicious ....everything about it is amazing. I personally love chettinad chicken dosa.  It's spicy but not in paprika way but rather flavouful.
50,Dosa, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Good authentic tasting dosas with delicious chutneys. Paneer dosas run out of stock fast so be early if you want to go for that. Mango lassi was Okayish
