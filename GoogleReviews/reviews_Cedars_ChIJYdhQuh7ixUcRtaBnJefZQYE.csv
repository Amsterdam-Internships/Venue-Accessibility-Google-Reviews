9,Cedars, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Cedars restaurant is very nice place, staff are friendly and welcoming. The negative point is that the food is not authentic Lebanese, coming from a Lebanese person. It was good enough but could be better. Most of the starters need the flavour of lebanon"

11,Cedars, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice terrace in the sun, people are friendly but you wait ages for anything like drinks or even dessert.... and whatever you order, stay away from sangria. It's 10 euro a glass, half full with ice of course. A total rip off!"
12,Cedars, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Loved everything. The food, the location and the service. I truly recommend this Lebanese restaurant. They have both discovery menus (from 35 euros to 60 euros) and a la carte menu. There are many starters (mezze) and main dishes of meat, …"

24,Cedars, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great environment, lovely view, but service a little sluggish. The food was good, well-cooked, though it wasn't amaaaaazing. Overall, a nice place to have a bite, fancy enough to take your in-laws. ;)"

32,Cedars, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Food is very tasty and the location is amazing
33,Cedars, 5 stars ,11 months ago,We ordered the Mezza plate for 2 persons. Because we were with four persons I ordered extra. This was not necessary because the box for 2 persons already contains a lot of food. There is a lot of choice for vegetarian food as well. We …

36,Cedars, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place has amazing food and great Lebanese wine! And if you are a shisha lover you can finish up your dinner with some nice shisha. Unfortunately they only had one flavor when we were there, but I hope that was only that night. …"

44,Cedars, 1 star ,5 months ago,I used to like the food there but today it was an epic failure when I got there to pick my online order. Tipical dutch service standard - they failed to find my order first and after finally finding my order of course it wasn’t ready so I …

47,Cedars, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Food was very underwhelming, we ordered the beirut set menu which costs about 60 euros for 2 pax and it was not worth the fair penny. Might have been a better idea to order their mains. Beautiful alfresco setting on the water but we will not be coming back."

49,Cedars, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Fabulous location and plenty of space. The food is great, both for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. Staff is extremely friendly and warm And Cedars is our favorite lebanese restaurant to go to. Would recommend a larger dessert menu as the only improvement point!"

54,Cedars, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The food did not amaze anyone from our group (two of them Lebanese). The service at the table was friendly, the person who took our checks not. He was visibly annoyed when we asked to split the bill."
55,Cedars, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Cedars offers very good food at an excellent location. Sitting near the water, enjoying seeing the boats while drinking excellent wine and good food is a treat. My family and I will come back to experience not only the good food but also very personal service. Thanks."

76,Cedars, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Good view if you sit on the terrace but very long wait times to get any service at all, Quality of the food is average at best. Not worth the money. I wouldn't recommended this place for food may be perhaps just drinks on the terrace."
77,Cedars, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, well presented.   Friendly warm staff too.   But we ordered and then were served with two dishes we did not order.   The waiter rushed away and we did not know what the dishes were.   We asked what they were and if they were the …"

81,Cedars, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food. Nice location on side of canal, with indoor and outdoor seating. Waiter advised us to share a main course and have a couple of starters to share - great advice as two mains would have been far too much. Overall, a great experience :-)"

84,Cedars, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome place. Close to the river so you can eat while checking the ducks. The food is great but it's a bit expensive. Service is nice. There's parking for cars and the place has accessibility to enter on it but I don't remember if the bathroom has it.
85,Cedars, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"At first we had amazing service, the food was amazing too - and more than we'd expected, so we had too much. Later they seemed to lose control of the number of guests, so the service was pretty bad near the end of our visit. A shame, otherwise I'd given a 5 star review."
86,Cedars, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Fresh and delicious food! And most of it is vegetarian, just really good. Service is friendly and does their best.

88,Cedars, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has been up and down from my favorite place then down to not so much and then up again. The food has been always amazing. They changed their menu to be only mazzas a few years ago, that's when I didn't like their menu. Whenever …"
89,Cedars, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent and super friendly service. The food was amazing and the ambiance great. If it's not raining grab a table on the terrace which is right ON the canal and enjoy the splendid view. We decided to come back with a bunch of people and …
90,Cedars, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and service. You can fill yourself with 2 warm entrees which are awesome! Do take precautions to not sit inside in the sun when it's shining (can get pretty warm). In that case, pick a shadowy place or sit outside."
91,Cedars, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was okay, a little bit expensive, but delicious. The place is really nice  but unfortunately our waiter was really dissapointive. We ordered some water and waiter forgot to bring it to us, for desterts menu we waited 5 minutes but …"

93,Cedars, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice Arabic food.. Very friendly staff
94,Cedars, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Nice location on the water. Food is good enough but the price is way too expensive for the quality you receive. I was a bit confused after being there, we thought it was Lebanese food because of its name (Cedars), but it is definitely not authentic Lebanese. should be labeled as Syrian/Arabic food. There's a difference."

101,Cedars, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We've chosen Cedar's just because of proximity to our hotel Best Western. What a lovely choice it was. Although the service was a bit slow everything else was fantastic, delicious food, friendly staff, excellent location by the small pond, cosy atmosphere. I definitely highly recommend."
102,Cedars, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was nice. However i wouldnt go for the set menu as the cold starters were all houmous based. Would have been nice to try the other options within this menu. But the portions were generous.
Staff were really friendly"
103,Cedars, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty! We ordered the surprise menu Beirut with 5 mazza, a salad, a main and a dessert. Everything was absolutely delicious, and it was a lot of food for 2 persons. The staff were absolutely brilliant, very attentive, very quick to …"

110,Cedars, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is teeeeerrible. They forgot about us and it was quite disappointing. More like a family restaurant, it's not what it looks from the outside. The food was ok and IMO there are better Libanese restaurants in Amsterdam (and cheaper). …"
111,Cedars, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The food is not authentic and not good. I'm a Lebanese expat living in The Netherlands and I can confirm that there are much better places here that are tastier and more authentic. To be fair the weekly main course is nice but the meza is …

113,Cedars, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The service is terrible. The staff won't even look at you. And when they finally do, the attitude is just rude.

115,Cedars, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The only reason I'm not giving Cedars 5 stars is because, while the food was deliciously good, the service was on the slow side. Went there on Sunday and didn't want to wait that long. If you're not in a hurry I would highly recommend this place."
116,Cedars, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent for a pre night out dinner. Dont order the set menu as you'll never finish it but focus on 4 or 5 mezzes per person. You'll still have a food coma :)
117,Cedars, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice food! Service was a bit slow. Despite that very friendly atmosphere! Loved the ambience and music in the background! Felt like I wasn't in Amsterdam for 2 hours!
