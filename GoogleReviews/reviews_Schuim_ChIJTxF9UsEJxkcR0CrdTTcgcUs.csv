1,Schuim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The plates for eating are cheaper than the level of city centre.

2,Schuim, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very bad service but that is Amsterdam. But it is the authentic experience.
3,Schuim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cute place with a colourful wall mural. Staff was very nice. I ate an avocado toast with a poached egg that was delicious, as was the english breakfast and the soup that mt friends took. I very much recommend it."
4,Schuim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Ultimately perfect burger at 10 am. Best you can do after a visit at the Bulldog...
5,Schuim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Stopped there for a coffee and Appel pie on a rather rainy afternoon. Worth it. The vibe was edgy and boho but cosy. The owner was super friendly and spoke to us in French. I recommend 100%

9,Schuim, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Caf√© Schuim is one of those places where the decor draws you in, and the food and beers keep you there for another bit. The regulars are about as colourful as the caf√© itself. We spent some time talking to several of them, which we mostly ‚Ä¶"
10,Schuim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place had the most interesting decor from floor to ceiling and everything in between - including the dolls made out of Heineken cans on the window sills. Great place to hang out and catch up with friends over some drinks.

15,Schuim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very relaxed atmosphere, nice food and beer."
16,Schuim, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Incredibly slow staff. After waiting for 45 minutes and inquiring about our food for the 3rd time we are told they ""lost"" the order. Had to wait another 25 minutes for the below average food to arrive. ‚Ä¶"
17,Schuim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Large cozy cafe with spacious terrace. A favourite haunt for locals. Good music and regular appearances of bands and dj's. Serves food during the daytime and early evening. A unique feature of this cafe is that it's decor is changed on a ‚Ä¶
18,Schuim, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Friday (18/9) night there was girl who took my beer :) She was drunk, loud but cute. Name start with S. If anyone knows her, it would be great. Location right on terrace, around 23h."
19,Schuim, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Due to the intoxication of the owner/bartender, we accidentally got a second order of delicious nachos for free ;) Drinks are a bit pricier than they should be due to proximity to the palace, but a wide selection and a variety of very tasty ‚Ä¶"

25,Schuim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The bar you want to meet your friends in the evening and talk about everything. Decorations haven‚Äôt change for years and years. But the materials, furniture, bar counter are so fascinating that if I was the owner, I would neither change a tiny little thing there."
26,Schuim, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"the place changes the interior design on a regular basis, it always looks really great. on the weekends you will get DJs with mostly electronic music. however it's not turning into a club, more like a bar with a little extra. something weird might happen, but don't worry, it's part of the place."
27,Schuim, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Nice place to have a drink at. Often on weekend evenings there are dj's playing and you can have a dance. The crowd there is quite alright. During daytime its nice to sit outside at the small but decent terrace and watch people walk and cycle by. Prices are not too bad.
28,Schuim, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Living in Amsterdam 7 years now, been coming here off and on for years but no longer! The unfriendly barmaid (and her drunk friend seated at the bar) treated my friend and I disdainfully for ordering two coffee drinks at 8pm...AT A CAFE ‚Ä¶"
29,Schuim, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great service and nice atmosphere, a good place in the center of Amsterdam to relax with friends!"

31,Schuim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Loving the atmosphere of the place and the lady at the counter is so much fun.
32,Schuim, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Don't come here if your thing is good food and exquisite service. Do come here if you want to witness one of the last few remnants of Amsterdam during the 80's. ‚Ä¶
33,Schuim, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice pub  lose to dam square
34,Schuim, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Beer prices are okay for being that close to Dam square, but that drink is not poured with any love. It's definitely a little crazy inside. It would massively benefit from a clean..."
35,Schuim, 5 stars ,4 months ago,We ate great hamburgers
36,Schuim, 1 star ,6 years ago,"The rudest bar staff I've ever encountered. Been living in Europe for some time and don't really expect more than even borderline rude/apathetic service, so long as I eventually get my order without blatant disdain. But this one tall ‚Ä¶"

38,Schuim, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cosy, great atmosphere and a good price/value ratio. Friendly staff and good food. The decor is amazing and you can go party here at night, or have a relaxed brunch or lunch in the daytime."
39,Schuim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"You can order pinta of beer and also food. I had veggie burger,it was ok but not the best burger in my life. I enjoy music playing here. Service was nice"
40,Schuim, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The bar has good music and a chilled crowd, but the toilets are two of the worst ever seen. Disgustingly dirty, broken and unsanitary with queues to use them as only two work. Fix the toilets and you would get 4*."
41,Schuim, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"One of the weirdest - and at times bizarre - places in Amsterdam. Sometimes Schuim can be very quiet and cozy, other times you can meet a guy on a wheelchair with a chicken on a leash as his companion, or have to wait 45 minutes for your ‚Ä¶"
42,Schuim, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very rude waitress. Sighing and unpolite remarks when  I friendly asked if she could bring the rest of what we ordered. Free insults with your coffee.
43,Schuim, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Going there almost 4 times a week... I love it
44,Schuim, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice local bar for drinks and snacks with a nice atmosphere. Even though it's very central it's still fairly local. Though service isn't the best.
45,Schuim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quiet Monday afternoon sheltering from the rain . Found the food to be excellent , Burger royale was a full meal with fries and salad . Good value !"
46,Schuim, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It was not great. Staff were unfriendly, bread was stale and other food was mediocre at best. Patio was small but cute. Fyi for tourists - no English menu available."
47,Schuim, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Great food but really slow service. Wasn't busy at all but we barely got attention and food took for ever to get to our table.
48,Schuim, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Best spot near Dam Square for a fun night in a spacious pub. Nice atmosphere, great beer collection, and (maybe my luck?) double shots in the spirit drinks"
49,Schuim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Got harassed by a 50+ white woman who was tripping her balls of, and man was she all over the place. But then her mate gave me a bum of really nice K so it evened out! ‚Ä¶"
50,Schuim, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It took more then an hour to get a bagel. At the same time they forgot about our soup. It's a nice place for a drink, food is kind of mediocre."
51,Schuim, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Chicken burger tastes more like a falafel than chicken.. just don‚Äôt take it
But the place is nice and the owner is a really kind person!"

54,Schuim, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I enjoyed the few hours I spent here. Friendly staff, great music, nice beer, good ambience"
55,Schuim, 4 stars ,7 years ago,This bar is very hit and miss.  Sometimes it is packed with a fun crowd and great music.  Other times it is dead with a bunch of weirdos.  I still can't figure out when to go.
56,Schuim, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff not very interested in taking orders, just chatting and letting you wait when they are not busy. Place is nice and cozy."
57,Schuim, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Sat for 15m. The waitress said hello and then never asked what we wanted even though we called her three times.
We got up and left."
58,Schuim, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Never really helpful, never accepts our bookings because we don't spend enough money, we have to take our own orders, literally write them down like we are the waitress. Would love to come here more but service is just bad."
59,Schuim, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Deliciouse food and relaxed atmosphere, great music & friendly staff. Smokers room available."
60,Schuim, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Normal city pub, Dutch service, dirty and smelly like a pub should be! Not very impressed but it's a place to stop and get a drink."
61,Schuim, 3 stars ,4 years ago,it's a nice place in general but ordering some drinks might take a while when busy..
62,Schuim, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place to hang out & have a beer, the selection is a bit low and expensive. Hopefully they will serve Hertog Jan this y3ar at EVESterdam pub crawl."
