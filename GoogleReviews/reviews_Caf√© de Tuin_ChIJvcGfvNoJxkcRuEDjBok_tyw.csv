14,Caf√© de Tuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It is a nice place but for the famous Bruijn Café from Amsterdam I expected a more spectacular/original place. Even if the atmosphere is quite particular. They don't have black beers but a nice triple bio beer drafted.
15,Caf√© de Tuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Superb hot and cold sandwiches and a reasonable beer selection.  During the day they have outside seating and also use the terraces of the restaurants across the narrow street when they are not yet open.  Good spot for sitting around outside.
