0,Assaggi, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Little Italian restraint that doesn‚Äôt disappoint! The portions of food are just right and the small alleyway makes for a beautiful view of the church without the crowded touristy feel. We had a salad to start followed by pasta and then ‚Ä¶
1,Assaggi, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We stumbled upon this place. From the outside it looked so cozy and quaint, we chose it for the atmosphere. We also discovered that the food was excellent. The pasta with pistachio pesto and burrata is the best pasta I‚Äôve ever had. The carbonara was also so balanced and good. Highly recommend!"
2,Assaggi, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very cozy and cute restaurant. They just updated their menu and the new choices are great! I recommend their pizzas, pasta with zucchini sauce, Italian ice-cream and cheese cake. I particularly loved the display of the cheese cake as it seemed like a little potted plant ü™¥Very good and friendly service!"
3,Assaggi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Let me start with claiming that this place has the most cozy atmosphere and attentive waitresses.

7,Assaggi, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Had a very pleasant experience in this cozy Italian place. People working there are amazing. Very attentive and kind. Special compliments for the Parmigiana di melanzane. Next time returning to try the rest of the dishes we saw at the tables nearby.
8,Assaggi, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"We had the last dinner probably this year, but it was with great atmosphere. The food was very nice. We had to wait a little while, but that's why maybe it tasted twice better ;) Risotto was delicious, I wish we had time to order extra for takeaway for tomorrow."

12,Assaggi, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,Friendly staff and nice setting. Food was ok but expensive given small portions that were very small. Also no bread is given on the side or any small side snack that you would expect from such a place.
13,Assaggi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Discovered recently in Jordaan area. Not very eye catching from the outside, but inside is such a nice atmosphere.

14,Assaggi, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"We were lucky to get a table in the last night before closure. It was quite busy, so we had to sit at the bar, but the space at the bar as for us was the most cozy and separate from the rest of the tables. Tip for everyone, ask the table at ‚Ä¶"

I shared the burrata+ San Daniel ham with the most snacking truffle + olive oil, followed by the peace soup (king crab was plentiful and delish), followed by the boulanese pasta.

93,Assaggi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,5 minute walk from Anne Frank house; we found this very convenient. It looked much better than many other Italian restaurants we had peered into. Good food and service; we had pasta and pizza. Would recommend.
94,Assaggi, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was of a passable quality, however my girlfriend and I both felt very unwelcome. It seems the waiter/workers are warm, friendly and talkative to the locals, but cold, blunt and unfriendly towards tourists. We would also have to wait for service longer than those around us, so it seems locals have preferential treatment."
95,Assaggi, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We got sat down quickly and got our food ordered and delivered extremely quickly but that was it. Got ignored for the rest of the night, food was not good at all just about ‚Äòokay‚Äô. The locals though got served and treated very well with the ‚Ä¶"

98,Assaggi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had the Assaggi pizza here which was really good. If you're wondering which one to get then go for that one.
The waiters and waitresses were really friendly and jokey. They also let us in for food at about 10.30pm, so if you're looking for dinner a bit late then this is the place to go"
99,Assaggi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We eat here for the second time and, like last time we enjoyed. The food is made with love and care, and you can enjoy. My favorite is the seafood pasta, homemade pasta and yummy with a delicious sauce, and even pizza-delicious heaven!!!"

103,Assaggi, 1 star ,3 years ago,"THE WORST RIP-OFF IN AMSTERDAM!
Looks nice from the outside but service and management are poor, intransparent, non-reactive and trying to mislead you to make excessive money. ‚Ä¶"
104,Assaggi, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The tomato sauce on the pizza is only tomato puree, there's no oregano or other spices, even when we asked for them.
Pizza and beer is also really expensive, being over 20‚Ç¨ for a pizza and large beer!"

117,Assaggi, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Disappointed.  Having read lots of good reviews, I was anticipating some good food.  But it was all very ordinary.  Not worth the money, even though the four course set menu was at a special price of 34.50."

119,Assaggi, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible service: they forgot our order and we just sat there for an hour before we asked where is our food, and that was their cue to start. Then the food was prepared in 15m and it was uncooked, and smelled like gasoline. Over-priced as well, for that kind of food. Wine was ok though..."

122,Assaggi, 1 star ,4 years ago,Horrible service. We sat down and waited over 15 minutes for the waiter to give us a menu (only after we asked). We then closed the menu and waited for another 15 minutes to order. We gave up and left. I would absolutely not recommend.
