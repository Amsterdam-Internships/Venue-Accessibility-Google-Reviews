1,In't Aepjen, 5 stars ,a month ago,"This is a solid bar. Wooden interiors, almost rotting with age.. Their house beer is super duper awesome, and the hosts are nice. Go there and get their house beer for sure. The ambiance and just the fact people have been sitting there for centuries makes you feel special"
2,In't Aepjen, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We had great time and beer at this place! :)
Cozy, warm, friendly people and staff, just what we needed.
Will definitely come back again!"
3,In't Aepjen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The atmosphere and history of the bar are very cool. Great place to sit and relax and enjoy a beer. The barman was very nice and let us squeeze in a beer right before closing.
4,In't Aepjen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I like this place very much. Especially atmosphere inside. It is cosy and nice. Almost darkness, monkeys in cage, small tables, little bit dust and crowd - it all makes you feel like in a very old traditional pub. The you can find here a good variety of beers."
5,In't Aepjen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A great place with plenty of history behind it. Good beer selection and a very nice and competent barman. Although the place could seem quite like a tourist attraction, it's actually very authentic and packed with the locals. Absolutely loved it <3"

11,In't Aepjen, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Very rude staffl, we sat down on the terrace with our phone on a selfie stick, Immediatly a guy came out to say: we are not going to do this: LEAVE. Not a word more, no discussion possible... we were perplex, it was so rude and unprofessional"

13,In't Aepjen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Enjoyed the house brew at this bar that was established in 1519.  This is not a fancy bar. Gilded trim and wall portraits still adorn the space. Memorabilia from centuries long gone set the scene. Authentic Amaterdam A.F.  Check it out.
