0,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Good ambiance but an average place, worth for the money."
1,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best thai that I had around the Jordaan so far. The sweet & spicy curry was lovely and there’s a tofu option for every sauce. A nice selection of wines as well.
2,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"A very cute restaurant. The fish cakes were soso, the rest if the food that we orderedwas delicious, and the amuse from the house was very creative and tasty way to start our dinner. The service was good. I would definitely recommend friends to go here!"
3,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super cozy, delicate and modern atmosphere. One of those places where you feel it’s unique and a speciality to eat there. Ordered the Kwang Prik Gang, ate venison with black pepper sauce and cashews. Super combination super tender
The salmon in red curry is also a delight"
4,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Some of the finest Thai food I've ever had. Amazing service to combine with the excellent quality of food. Would rate it higher if Google allowed that!

11,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Delicious, good value for money"
12,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely Thai in Jordaan. Food is consistently good and super tasty. Great noodles and curries. Like that the staff are Thai, shows a level of authenticity some other restaurants locally don’t have. Wine list is pretty good too. A local favourite. Wish they did delivery!"
13,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Restaurant is a nice location, a bit away from the crowds. It's possible to eat outside, although there are only a few tables. The menu is a mix of classical dishes and fusion dishes, such as curries with venison. Service was quick. The …"

16,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Beautiful restaurant with delicious Thai food, friendly staff and perfectly located in the north part of the Jordaan. We really enjoyed Kinnaree with a group of friends and had a enough distance to eachother to stay Vivid proof."
17,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 2 stars ,a year ago,Ordered online. It was so spicy that impossible to eat.. :( too much red pepper. The coconut soup with chicken was also lacking some taste.
18,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Excellent, authentic Thai cooking. Very nice menu. Surprising desserts. Well oil service. Definitely recommend it and sets the level high before the other Thai restaurants of Amsterdam. If you like Bird or Kratiam Thai, Kinnaree is definitely better for me & I didn't try them all yet!

21,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is okay but unreasonably pricey for the simple dishes like tofu and vegetable. They charge for tab water, which is uncommon in Amsterdam and a cash grab in tourist district. Too bad about the price but I won't go back."

23,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great Thai place for an ok price. I go to Amsterdam on a regular basis and when I am nearby Westerstraat I have to take away some nice spicy shrimp soup and rice with shrimps and vegetables in oyster sauce. It is very tasty and they prepare the food quite fast. Recommended!
24,Kinnaree Thai Cuisine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited 3 times now. Red Curry, Green Curry and fish in a sweet curry. All great and easily worth of the price. And the dessert ice cream baked inside the coconut dogh ball. Yammy."
