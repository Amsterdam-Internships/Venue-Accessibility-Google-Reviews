0,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 1 star ,a month ago,Story time: went here with 3 friends. The cashier was very nice. He gave us free weed. We smoked a little bit and we felt pretty good but things took a turn. The security guard came in to talk to us. He was nice at first but then came to ‚Ä¶
1,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Not the very best weed around, but the budtenders are top class..I  was well looked after from Tuesday until Friday, so even though I missed my flight on Thursday (10:2:22) I still had a very good overall experience....Thanks in no small way to Michel and Co at bulldog rockshop"
2,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I've visited this rock coffee shop once and loved it. But now, I'm giving 1 star because on my second visit the security man didn't let me in because his phone wasn't reconizing my VaccineQR code. I've visited asmterdam and all places read my qr. The security was not flexible and treated me badly."
3,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 1 star ,5 months ago,Greatest coffee shop if you want to leave as sober as when you entered. Got their cupcakes and didn't feel anything. Most expensive regular cupcake I've ever paid for.
4,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Been 4 times to date and every time I have been welcomed with kindness and open arms. The staff are amazing and are a major reason for me coming back to Amsterdam let alone to the coffeeshop. Hope it stays open for a long time and will be coming back indefinitely!
5,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 1 star ,5 months ago,Biggest tourist scam if you wanna get high by an edible. I'm not even a user and didn't feel a thing with a whole cupcake.

27,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Unless I'm very much mistaken, this was the very first coffee shop I ever tried out. If I'm right it was in the mid to late 1990,s. It was an awesome experience the staff were so cool and helpful. The merchandise was top rate at the time and the hash tea, well all i can say is stick to 1 cup and don't go ott like i did. First Class."
28,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"So it may be ""weed touristy"" and on the beaten path, but the staff is great. There didn't appear to be any security nor was I asked for an ID. (Tip: either act like you know how to purchase marijuana or bring someone with you who knows more than you). Decent cappuccino."

36,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 1 star ,3 years ago,We bought prerolled Joints (4 for 15‚Ç¨) and they're basically cigarettes. You had to open them up and search a long time to find a tiny bit of weed. If you want a real coffeshop experience better go a bit outside the city centre. In the east are a lot of really nice ones.
37,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I didnt bean in but its looking crazy good
38,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Got some of the higher quality weed than other shops but the prices reflect although they're worth it, some of the best cheese strain I've tried. It's a little cramped sometimes but downstairs is quite cozy."

43,The Bulldog Rock Shop, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"It should be the first stop when you get out of the central station! It's a cosy room, few tables outside and they have great ""stuff"". Muffins could be better though. Friendly staff and an extensive menu of ""stuff"""
