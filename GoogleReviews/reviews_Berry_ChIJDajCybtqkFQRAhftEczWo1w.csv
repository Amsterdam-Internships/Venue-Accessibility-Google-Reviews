3,Berry, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Maybe this place is only good at girls' hair... I had my hair cut there and was a bit disappointed, especially compare to the price.

11,Berry, 1 star ,2 years ago,"A reservation is like a joke in this place. Here's the story. I was on the waiting list for a hair cut on Sunday. Yuka reached out and said someone cancelled an appointment and asked me whether I'd like to take it. I said yes, and I got the ‚Ä¶"
