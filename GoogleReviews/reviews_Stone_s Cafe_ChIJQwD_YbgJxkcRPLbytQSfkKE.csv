18,Stone's Cafe, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The place has a separated bar and night club. The issue is that the bar feels a lot more like a nightclub than the actual nightclub part. It's quite pricey and very crowded at night. I didn't stay for more than one drink and have no ‚Ä¶
19,Stone's Cafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very loud. But its in the red light district so that is only to be expected. Good beer. Sports on some screens, old 70s music videos on others. The staff was very helpfull and all had lovely smiles."

35,Stone's Cafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best bar in Amsterdam, if you want to have a good time go there with or without your friends, the music is fine for any taste, the place is pretty great so you won't be disturbed by the lack of space there like in the streets of the city or some others bar. Definitely recommanded."
36,Stone's Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,New bartender throws beer out when you are looking the other way. Then starts yelling at you when say smt about it. Hospitality level is below 1*. Shame as the bar is a nice place.
