1,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"A nice place to eat, the food is great, and the meals are quite big as well. It is a cozy place, and at the same time, with enough room for everyone. We've been there a few times and we have never been disappointed."
2,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"We ordered the Loetje steak as well as the tuna and two starters. The entrees were pretty good but the jam√≥n ib√©rico and manchego cheese with mango chutney starters were the highlight. Unfortunately, the service wasn't great. We didn't get ‚Ä¶"
3,Loetje in De Pijp, 3 stars ,10 months ago,Very simple presentation (could be improved). I ordered a club chicken sandwich (11‚Ç¨) and I expected other type of bread and fresh chicken (it had ham chicken). I think it is overpriced. ‚Ä¶

7,Loetje in De Pijp, 1 star ,4 months ago,The food is nice however I had asked for the liver and I had received the fish. The waitress was arguing with me that I have ordered the fish while I have asked her about the liver if it is well done or medium and she even double checked ‚Ä¶

9,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, good atmosphere, staff is very helpful and very attentive. They are famous for their steaks, and they well deserve it! But their apple pie stole my heart üòç it was so delicious!!! Prices are actually very reasonable for Amsterdam. I will definitely come back there next time I'm in Amsterdam."

Good value for money"
17,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went for an ""early"" lunch at 11am and there was no wait. This place was highly recommended as a place for Dutch food, friendly service, and greatly enjoyed the Biefstuk Bali, a mixed salad, and some fries. By far one of my more favorite places in Amsterdam."
18,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Good steak, reminds me of how my grandmother was making it back in the days."
19,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"our friend recommended this restaurant. It was a great decision, we ate the excellent stake they are known for. Very pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff."
20,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I came here with my colleagues. I definitely liked the stake and I will go there to try the stake with other sauces.
21,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was our second time eating here...and hopefully will not be our last. The food (steak) was delicious and the atmosphere cozy!
22,Loetje in De Pijp, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Not very friendly. Very rude, even for Amsterdam standards. Worst sweet potato fries I have ever eaten in my entire life. Really awkward and unpleasant experience."

24,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Lovely staff, food as always yummy. Restaurant was super warm so this could be better. Will definitely come back"
25,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good sushi bowl option from a traditionally steak based establishment! Reliable experience with a sunny sidewalk terrace.
26,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favourite restaurants in Amsterdam to have steak. Can highly recommend the ""Bali"" with some slices of bread and the sauteed mushrooms."
27,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Casual Dutch dining. Relaxed atmosphere. Nice house red. Nice food. Quality Dutch style. Try it if you in the area.
28,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Just had the best Appeltart ever here! Perfectly moist and warm, a generous portion of homemade slagroom (whipped cream) next to it. Oh my god, it is pie heaven! Next to that, it's a nice place with cozy lighting and super friendly staff. I'll be back!!"
29,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing Dutch steak. Great atmosphere. Pro Dutch tip:  order the bread to soak up the juice from the steak.
30,Loetje in De Pijp, 1 star ,a year ago,"They forgot our order, but no apology, just said it is coming, so it took almost an hour for the food to arrive. They then did not offer desert and delivered the bill, without asking, while we were still eating. To make matters worse, they ‚Ä¶"
31,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The service was a great. And the ample outdoor setting is a huge draw as it was easy to get a spot for two.  The food was good but nothing amazingly special. We had schnitzel and chicken saute. Both were well prepared and and a good portion ‚Ä¶

34,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cooler, more modern extension of an Amsterdam classic. The steaks are the best in the world, and the fries and salad support it in the best way. The butter gravy is to die for and the beer is served with excellence. Be prepared to wait for ‚Ä¶"
35,Loetje in De Pijp, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The salads were better than the steaks and the service was ok, great for big groups."
36,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a very small place, however the food is fantastic. Me and my partner stopped by as we were walking into town. All the food is fresh and has so much Flavour, the staff are friendly and it seems to be a local place for the near by ‚Ä¶"

40,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"For many years Loetje is known for their food, but can I get an AMEN for their staff!! They are always so very welcoming, friendly and helpful. They are truly an exception in Amsterdam. This restaurant knows how to give excellent service and has the best staff in town."
41,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely spot. Popped in for a bite of lunch. Had the smoked salmon on focaccia and it did not disappoint. ‚Ä¶
42,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Long wait (2 hours from arrival to food) on Saturday evening. The tenderloin steak had a perfect sauce, but the steak itself was overcooked (ordered medium, got well done). ‚Ä¶"
43,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I was very much looking forward to their steak with garlic sauce, fries and dame blanche. It was a busy Friday night and we had to wait for our seats; wait time was exactly as indicated. Service was very smooth, fast, friendly, ‚Ä¶"
44,Loetje in De Pijp, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I would not recommend this branch of De Loetje. We had a party of 11 and had to squeeze into a 8 seater table. After our arrival our waitress appeared 15 min later to take our drink orders, but did not supply us with menus until we asked. ‚Ä¶"
45,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great steaks and service. The beefsteak swimming in margarine (they call it juice) is a heart attack on a plate. If there were any healthy menu choices, such as a baked potato instead of fries, I would give this one 5 stars."
46,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely restaurant. Staff were friendly, food was fantastic, great beer! The steak with gravy was gorgeous. Will definitely be returning next time we're over."
47,Loetje in De Pijp, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Awful service. Our order for the main course was forgotten, but waiting staff told us this was our own fault because we ordered a starter. When the bill had some items on it we definitely didn't order, we were again treated like we were the ‚Ä¶"
48,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As a Canadian visiting Amsterdam, I've found their local cafes very excellent in terms of food and service.  This cafe maintained that standard.  My wife and I ordered two club sandwiches,  turkey and salami respectively.  They were very ‚Ä¶"
49,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is very cosy and confortable. The light is low, so perfect to go for a date or close friends. Eating wise, the Loetge hamburger was good! and the onion soup very good! Good place and well connected. The burger does not include ‚Ä¶"
50,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good for lunch, nice atmosphere. Burger was tasty as was the mushroom soup."
51,Loetje in De Pijp, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food at Loetje is and has been excellent. But now they seem to have a true staff challenge given their expansion drift. As an example, once we were offered our table, it took 25 minutes to get a menu. And no eye contact was made up to ‚Ä¶"
52,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is beautiful and the food is delicious. As I do not eat read meat, I always choose the tasty and perfectly cooked medium rare tuna steak. This place is always a good choice!"
53,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Best steak in Amsterdam, maybe best filet I have ever had. Trying to figure it out. I think the only down point is potatoes, the fries are not standing the quality of the meat, which would be nice, to have a great side dish for full ‚Ä¶"
54,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I Was There last week for first time and I had it a wonderful time. I Was @ hotel Ocura and instead of eat @ the hotel I choose this place to eat. The girls working there were great. Customer service phenomenal...
55,Loetje in De Pijp, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We walked to this restaurant from another Loetje location where we had a reservation. When we arrived at the first location, we were told that the power had just gone out in the kitchen and it was unclear when it would be back on. Instead ‚Ä¶"
56,Loetje in De Pijp, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good food but they should really have a reservation system, that would show respect for customers. You cannot reserve a table but instead you can wait 30-45 minutes at a very small bar by the door, always crowded. Same story in any Loetje you go to"
57,Loetje in De Pijp, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The steak is great but beacme way to expensive and the service and everything else have been a disgrace past 2-3 times. Salads are from the supermarket and the fries are for children size. Too bad it was an amazing place for great food
58,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent place, fantastic food, well cooked, great value for money. Dick was a real professional, sets the best example for all the restaurant professionals to follow! Well done guys!!"
59,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loetje never disappoints. I am yet to try something not tasty there. I usually go for the steak, but sometimes switch to the Burger, or Schnitzel and I always know what I get."
60,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Seriously great steak üëå have been twice in the past month and both times have been fantastic experiences. Also tried the burger and carpaccio - DElicious!
61,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The tenderloin with Bali sauce is incredible. It's not super cheap but it's worth the price. It's one of my favorite places in Amsterdam.
62,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The steak is an absolute must!!!! Great service and a very nice selection on drinks.

64,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very good beefsteak and tasty sauce.
Good quality food in general.
A bit pricey."
65,Loetje in De Pijp, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Good food but the service is not the most attentive. Also a bit strange that they put bacon on the mixed salad without mentioning this in the menu. Otherwise quite large portion sizes.
66,Loetje in De Pijp, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very disappointing experience, we ordered 3 dishes, waited for 45 minutes and eventually only 2 arrived. The quality of food was good but not worth all the waiting, especially given it was only is and another 5-6 tables."
67,Loetje in De Pijp, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ambience with savory dishes. Pan cakes are really good. Our server wasn‚Äôt the greatest, thus no 5 stars"

72,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Their ""biefstuk xl"" and ""biefstuk balie"" (spicy)  are incredible, very high quality all the time. Order some white bread with it for the very good meat juices and some salads and fries with it. Salad and fries are enough for 3 persons."
73,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As usual in Loetje: steak with sambal sauce, to dip with bread or French fries, exquisite. Not Haute Cuisine, but right what you expect!"
74,Loetje in De Pijp, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I chose to eat the tuna steak and it was delicious
