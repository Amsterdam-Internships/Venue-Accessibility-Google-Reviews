2,Farina, 5 stars ,a month ago,Farina exceeded my expectations! Service was prompt and personal and anything we tried on the menu was spectacular. The pastas we tried pushed our (limited) comfort zone of pasta and helped us discover flavors we loved! Also! Farina has standout dessert options that just make the whole experience that much better.

19,Farina, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Hands down the best dining experience we've had since the pandemic began.   We had a party of 8 and the service was flawless.   Between the table we all had the opportunity to try several things.   All pasta is made in house daily,  meats cut on site and even cured and aged on site.   Incredible flavors from the wizard himself."

26,Farina, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Anniversary dinner.. nice atmosphere.. great food & attentive service..
27,Farina, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"Agree with other reviews - the food is hit or miss. Others I dined with had great dishes, but I had the chef-recommended orecchiette and it was very forgettable. I expected a lot of umami from the burnt onions and it was just blah. Cocktails were also unbalanced and mediocre."
28,Farina, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"A gem of a restaurant in the crossroads area. Decor and ambiance is understated Italian elegance. The food often prepared by owner/chef Michael Smith, as was our exquisite meal was is some of the best I have had. This night his wife Nancy …"

32,Farina, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great atmosphere, really love the interior design of the space.  Clean, comfortable.  The food was good to excellent from cocktails to wine to appetizers and entrees.  The gnocchi was a bit spongy and had an odd texture.  The proprietor stopped by and discussed the meal which was an added bonus."
33,Farina, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"For me, this restaurant is perfect.  They had a great selection of Oysters, some of the best wine I've ever had, and the menu was excellent.  The Italian Chopped Salad was an elevated take on the classic dish.  I don't usually eat veal, but …"

37,Farina, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is our ""go to"" place, whether a special occasion or just for an enjoyable evening.  Every aspect of the experience is impeccable.  We seldom place our own orders, usually asking Sean to bring us what he chooses.  I absolutely recommend Farinas!"
38,Farina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The best thing about Farina is the ambiance. The service and food weren't anything to write home about. I was recommend four items: Sardinian Black Rice, Cheese Filled Caramelle, Linguini Puttanesca & Veal Scallopini only one of which I …"

41,Farina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Let me start off by saying that I review a LOT of resturants all over the country. I can count on one hand the reaturants that I have given 5 stars to. I'm not a fan of how Google does not allow half stars as I think nothing is perfect. I …
42,Farina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Saying that James Beard Award-winning chef's restaurant is great is kind of obvious. Instead, what I'll say is that for the same money as 801 Chophouse, we ate vastly better food. Pro tip: call before you go and tell them you want to order some Beggar's Purses. They will blow you away. One per person."
