2,Tibet, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Hands down the best sichuan food I‚Äôve had in a very long time. It brought me tears of joy and many memories back to my time in chengdu. Most authentic food I had outside of china and the staff is very very polite and recommends the best ‚Ä¶
3,Tibet, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Situated in Lange Niezel, in the heart of Amsterdam's red light area and just a stone's throw away from Chinatown's Zeedijk, is the multi award winning China Sichuan Restaurant/Chengdu. Not long ago, it was voted as one of the top 15 ‚Ä¶"
4,Tibet, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Authentic food, beautiful decoration, attentive service. The spicy hot is good for spicy food lovers, but if you are not very into it, be careful, most of dishes are more or less hot."
5,Tibet, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Authentic Sichuan food, good flavors and spices. Watch your spiciness tolerance, this place is no joke. Service is just OK and price is a bit steep because of location, but it's all about the food here. Hard to find better Sichuan food in town."
6,Tibet, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"One of the best places for authentic Chinese food in Amsterdam. Very helpful staff, sweet and sour pecking duck surely a must try :)"
7,Tibet, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Be aware there are 3 Sichuans in Amsterdam, I have been to all 3 places, and this Sichuan restaurant located at Lange nezel 24, is literally the best one in taste and service. Their food is more authentic, and it‚Äôs normally less crowded ‚Ä¶"
8,Tibet, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Very nice Sichuan restaurant. The foods were all delicious and tasty. Very friendly staffs and nice unique decorations inside. What a pleasant dining experience.
9,Tibet, 1 star ,a month ago,"Messed up my take-out order, clearly somebody else‚Äôs. Was too late when I realized, already at home and with a baby to feed. Food was good, but not what I ordered and way too spicy for my taste (I had carefully selected non-spicy dishes)"
10,Tibet, 5 stars ,a week ago,The pork lomein was excellent üëå. Service was solid.
11,Tibet, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Waauw. Excellent food. In a dodgy little street but excellent authentic food. Friendly staff as well, which is, well, unusual for an Asian restaurant."
12,Tibet, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice and colorful ambience, very friendly waitress and good service. However, food was below average: marinated beef was a bit musty (garlic of low quality?), Beijing Duck was not really authentic, rather just fried duck only, a bit fatty. Prices are ok."
13,Tibet, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The mid-autumn festival dinner set is lit! So affordable with so much dishes and the gift moon cake is very sweet-thought. This is not just a restaurant but a place cures the homesickness any time when you need. My top recommendation üá®üá≥
14,Tibet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very delicious Chinese food, have to admit it tastes exactly like what you can get in China. Services r good and prices are reasonable. And a cute sweet cat can make ur dining experience more fun."
15,Tibet, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Since I am Dutch when I go to a 'Chinese' restaurant my favorites are the usual 'Dutch Indonesian' dishes. I was planning on ordering a good old Babi Pangang but did not see this on the menu. I was so happy with the alternative. I ordered ‚Ä¶

22,Tibet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome place. Great food. Attentive and friendly staff. The food is very tasty but be warned the mild chilli dishes are spicy. For those of you who like very spicy food go for the spicy prawn dish. Wow! So good!

33,Tibet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food! Servers had a bad attitude! Clearly speaking badly about us in there language! Maybe it was because I was black? They definitely seemed to have issue with our requests of water and ice!

51,Tibet, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazingly authentic dishes with fair price!
52,Tibet, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible food. Nice staff. Fire the cook and the manager. I almost never leave 1 star reviews and love Chinese food. We tried a few mouthfuls paid and left. Left 80% of the food untouched. I can barely cook but if i tried my hand at Chinese with zero knowledge of the cusine i might make something better

56,Tibet, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nice ambiance but the food is average and I'm quite certain that better options can be found around. The wine was simply terrible
57,Tibet, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It's the first time I ate Tibetan food, but I expected better testing stuff. The soup was thick and had little flavor. The main dish was OK, but again had very neutral taste."

79,Tibet, 4 stars ,5 years ago,I would recommend this restaurant to a friend. It was open until 11:30pm (later than other highly rated restaurants) and the food was delicious. There were only two other groups there during our visit so service was quick.

81,Tibet, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The best chinese food in Amsterdam!
82,Tibet, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Absolutely disgusting. Noodles swimming in oil and sherry - could have got drunk off of them if i had the balls to finish the dish, then again i'd probably have a heart attack from the amount of oil in them too. The photos in the menu should have been enough of a warning sign."
83,Tibet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good Szechuan food for a very good price in the red light district. Kitchen a bit slow though. Many chinese people go there to eat too. Good sign.

95,Tibet, 1 star ,5 years ago,Not really Tibetan. Chinese. It shows disrespect to Tibetan Buddhism . It has Buddha wallpaper that's ripped and sellotaped up. Total disrespect to an image of Shakyamuni Buddha. Typical Chinese disrespect to Tibet. The restaurant is done up like a gompa. Once again disrespectfull.  Over priced and bland food.
96,Tibet, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I went there twice with my wife. For dinner, the food was absolutely fantastic. We went a second time (for lunch), and the food was average at best. I am not sure if they are just not consistent, or they have different chefs for lunch/dinner."
