0,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great comfortable and calm place in a not so busy area of Amsterdsm. Really great fresh juices and nice to relax while looking at one of the canals.

2,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Freshly squeezed juices, reasonably priced and fast, courteous service. And a relaxing canal view to top things. Very recommended."
3,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We went here randomly due to nature calling and we were pleasantly surprised at the ambience and the service. It’s a great place to relax and unwind. Great music!!! Good beer and cocktails. We didn’t try the food but we saw others ordering and enjoying so I think it is worth a try!
4,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"On a cold and wet day after a long-ish walk, the piping hot ginger tea and apple pie were exactly what we  were looking for.
The staff was friendly and helpful. …"
5,Cafe Het Paleis, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Absolutely disgusting, not only did we wait 30 minutes to be served, the food was cold, nasty and disgusting. When we paid the server named Adele told us we did not pay for our poffertjes (which we didn’t touch anyway because they were …"

7,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My third time here and it's been delicious every time. I recommend the salmon send the burger.
8,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place for a quick stop for a coffee or a drink. Although close to the square, it wasn’t too touristic. And the
sandwiches are thick, so have a big mouth.."
9,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good place to rest those legs after hours of walking and to get a good bite. Friendly staff.

12,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"really friendly personal, nice place and good food."
13,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy restaurant near the busy area around Anne Frank’s house. Reasonably priced, fast service and quality food. Thank you!"
14,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Excellent food and wonderful staff! Loved the views and sitting outside. It was right down the street from where we were staying but worth coming to from anywhere
15,Cafe Het Paleis, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Not worth it, cold food, waited for a long time to be served and rude staff"
16,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I absolutely love the hot chocolate they make, and a great ambiance and staff."
17,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very tasty coffee, best I've had in a long time. We had no food so can't tell about that. Great place to sit outside next to the water. Service was charming when we were there (19.06.2020)"
18,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice independent cafe, not far from the Dam square. Breakfast is great."
19,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Tomato sup is great :) unfortunately we was ignored for a while by waiter and need to wait our order around half hour.
20,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Not outstanding but pleasant. One of dozens of great corner bars around Amsterdam canals. A great place to sit for an hour or six, depending on how able you are to face an attempt at walking.The usual choice of interesting beers and Dutch gins."
21,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful location in the hearth of the city center of Amsterdam. Great place to spend some time looking ad the Singel canal and the people and bicycles passing by. Great people, very friendly and excellent choice to keep Vervein tea! I went there in the afternoon so I didn't try the food. Next time."
22,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice staff, food was good too. The hot chocolate was AMAZING."
23,Cafe Het Paleis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Cute little place on the water with friendly staff. I ordered the Salmon with potatoes. Unfortunately my dish took over an hour to be served. The waiter was nice enough to discount the tab but I had to scarf my hot dish down because I was …
24,Cafe Het Paleis, 1 star ,3 years ago,The waiters try hard to satisfy but are clearly understaffed. We got our sides over half hour after our burgers and when asking to speak to a supervisor (as obviously not the waiters fault) was told there’s no one there. Honestly avoid as the kitchens not good enough to deal with a modest rush.
25,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoyed dinner here on our first night in Amsterdam. Good food, great menu selections, friendly staff. Location is great, beautiful view overlooking the canal."
26,Cafe Het Paleis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Fast and easy food in a classic setting. Good for coffee but don't go here for food. Most items on the menu are delivered in an unimpressive way or small portions. It's hard to fail at classics like Club Sandwiches or Ceasar Salads, but …"
27,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Excellent white chocolate and a nice view over the canal. A drawback is that the street is fairly busy so we could not keep a normal conversation without pausing for heavy traffic when sat outside. Service-wise it was alright, even though strangely it annoyed the waitress that I kept speaking Dutch to her."
28,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Service was very good. The place is quite clean. There has been a mistake in my bill due to a misunderstanding in the order but it was somewhat rectified. The food was good and the menu big. It's also kid friendly with chocolate spreads for breakfast.
29,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favourites in Amsterdam, great service, good food options and snacks. The Angus burger is a must. Great location also, especially in the afternoon to catch some sun and enjoy a nice beer, next to Dam square and close to the central station."
30,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was okay. Food was just okay, we had the wings, and curry (girlfriend didn't care for). They were out of the steak that I tried to order. I like the location and atmosphere."
31,Cafe Het Paleis, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Okay food, we ate dinner and ordered the chicken and beef. The order was messed up and we did not receive our appetizer. Steak was cooked rare when asked for medium rare, chicken was cooked but served slightly colder than room temperature. Alright food, but not a €15 meal."
32,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had the focaccia with goat cheese and the hot chocolate. It was soooo good. Loved the vibe inside and the view of the canal. Really glad I stopped here
33,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice owner, tasty breakfast"
34,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A nice place to chill out while enjoying your coffee....next to famous Dam Square ( only a couple of hunsred meters away) but silent and away from the usual crowd. Try their nice lunch menu while enjying the view by the Amstel canal..
35,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice drinks and eaties, friendly service. Nice place, close to Amsterdam's central shopping streets (Kalverstraat and Nieuwendijk) too. Only one downside: when it gets crowded (it's a very small place), it quickly gets uncomfortably congested."
36,Cafe Het Paleis, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I was asked to leave my table. Right after i placed order some waiter comes up to me and say ""this table is reserved for 6pm"". And it was 5:35. So what now? i am asked to leave? When I said ""so?"" he walked away and said nothing. No apology? …"
37,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little place. Good coffee, kind staff, and they made some really nice fried chicken, even though it was a surprising item to find on the menu at a place like this."
38,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Super friendly service and perfect apple pie. Every other food also looks really delicious. I really enjoyed! (though the price a vey bit expensive than I expected) Highly recommend you!

45,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A cosy atmosphere, with draft beers and tasty hot beverages, very yummy Bitterballen and nice snacks and sandwichs, a minute walk from Dam square but without the super touristy feeling. I love it!"
46,Cafe Het Paleis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I don’t recommend this place to the tourists. We waited for an hour for a soup and salad. though food was nice, we cannot wait for more food to come, so we left."
47,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was OK and the service reasonable, but the roadworks immediately outside spoil the atmosphere. Also tries to tailor the menu a little too much to the huge numbers of tourists passing by"
48,Cafe Het Paleis, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"We really liked this place and came back a second time, a little dip in service during busy dinner hour to be expected. I really enjoyed the Oma Bob croquettes, club sandwich had a bit too much mayo for my taste"
49,Cafe Het Paleis, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"Awesome focaccias!!! Good music (not live), friendly staff and free wifi! They take all sorts o cards including Amex. Try the Palm beer."
