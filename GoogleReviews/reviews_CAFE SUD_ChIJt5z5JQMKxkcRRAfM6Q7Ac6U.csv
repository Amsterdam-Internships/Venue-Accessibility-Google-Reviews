0,CAFE SUD, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a great neighborhood find. I happened to stop in on a night when they were doing their Indonesian menu and it was phenomenal (I really enjoyed the French Pinot Noir as well)!  Staff was super friendly and the service was excellent. The food scene in The WTC neighborhood has been impressive and Cafe Sud is in the thick of it!
1,CAFE SUD, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the once a month Indonesian special dinner.
It's a feast of small plate dishes and includes a wonderful desert. Service is always excellent."
2,CAFE SUD, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A lovely family run restaurant, which offers a nice respite from the mostly corporate-esque restaurants in the area.  Good food with a nice sidewalk patio to enjoy on sunny days."
