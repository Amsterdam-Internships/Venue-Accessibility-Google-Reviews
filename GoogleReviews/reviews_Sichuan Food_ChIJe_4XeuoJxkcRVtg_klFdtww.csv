0,Sichuan Food, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"We made a booking at this restaurant. Because they ones owned a michelin star.
The welcoming of the staff was warm and we were offeren to sit outside or inside. ‚Ä¶"
1,Sichuan Food, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Good food, duck menu is amazing. Prices at the higher end."
2,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Heaven on earth @ Sichuan Food Restaurant at Reguliersdwarsstraat in Amsterdam. It's a total package of no nonsense and high end service.
This family owned restaurant with it's traditional Sichuan food in Amsterdam is ‚Ä¶"
3,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Amazing night ! Staff will attend to you as if you were the only person sitting at there table. Duck is the best I've ever had !! Romantic and worth every dime
4,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty, friendly and fast service. High prices are justified, considering quality, service and location."
5,Sichuan Food, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Authentic taste, the cooking skill is high but the service can be improved. One main dish ordered completely forgotten to serve. Service employees are in general not professional. For such a high price level you would expect more than good food only. You actually pay for its reputation far away in the past. We will not come back again."
6,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Chinese restaurant in the city, wonderful service, always the freshest ingredients. We've been going here for years - the owners of this restaurant treat us like family when we go in. Such lovely people. And seriously the best peking duck pancakes you will EVER have tasted."
7,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I expected it to be really good and yet it was better! Everything I tasted I loved and for sure this is the best Chinese food I ever had but on top of that the service was really really good and professional. Not the cheapest place in town ‚Ä¶
8,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,9 months ago,The best roasted duck in the townÔºÅ ÔºÅsuper juicyÔºÅplus great service ÔºÅÔºÅ will come back soon üòãüòãüòã
9,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I love this place. My partner, parents and I go whenever we have visitors or when we're celebrating something. ‚Ä¶"
10,Sichuan Food, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"This restaurant is good but not more than an average Chinese restaurant anywhere in Europe. And definitely not a Michelin star. Not a single ""wow"" from me during the whole meal. Still they have this reputation, possibly justly earned in the ‚Ä¶"
11,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was AMAZING! Best chinese food that we ever had. You need to try the Peking Duck Menu it is so so (insert more ""so"") good. The serivce was also very very good. We will come back!"
12,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Incredible food and service in a comfortable warm setting. I cannot recommend this place enough. I had the delicious house special chicken and it was as good of Chinese food as I've had. The service was top notch and I felt as if the staff truly cared about my experience.
13,Sichuan Food, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"They do not serve tap water and like many other restaurants in Amsterdam, the price of bottled water will be a surprise until you see the bill... prepare to pay extra for noodles/rice when they ask what would you prefer with your main dish. The food is not something to come back for either, tourist trap."
14,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"the most tasty duck, cooked and served in many different options. been there twice:) can't wait till next time I will be there.. It might be a little bit more expensive, but it has the same prices -as I was told- with the Chinese restaurant ‚Ä¶"
15,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It took me 4 trips to Amsterdam to find this place that I visited in 2004 with an old colleague. It was so memorable yet I could never triangulate where or what this restaurant was called in my previous visits using the technologies at hand ‚Ä¶
16,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Again, my wife and I had an excellent meal (Peking Duck) with some exquisite wines (Chateau-Neuf-du-Pape) here. Always amazing to come back to."
17,Sichuan Food, 3 stars ,4 years ago,My rating is on the conservative side. I had prawn with rice and it was quite good. The duck looked amazing. I will  be back to try the duck and hopefully increase the rating then.
18,Sichuan Food, 1 star ,4 years ago,"It was cold and we ordered a shrimp vegetable soup. Boy that was a mistake, the broth is like water . Waitress was unfriendly, we had to chase her down to get things like utensils. WorstChinese restaurant I‚Äôve ever been to."
19,Sichuan Food, 1 star ,2 years ago,Food is horrible. I dont know why it can claim sichuan food. It is just meat with a goopy sauce that is a bit spicy and sweet. Kinda like a more spicy sweet and sour sauce. ‚Ä¶
20,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, excellent food and strong bamboo liquore."
21,Sichuan Food, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Lekker gegeten maar: We had nice food, but a bit unclear that 4 euro extra is charged for rice or noodles. Should better be included in the main course."
22,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice Chinese dishes, and especially the staff's service was pretty good! I want to go back again :)"
23,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good & Nice Sechuan resturant.  We had Crispy Duck with sweet & sour Honey sauce.. Del...isious üëçüòÅ

27,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A long-time favourite. Possibly the best Peking Duck in Europe (three-course, crispy skin as the first). An institution."
28,Sichuan Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beat Chinese I've been to in my opinion because of the menu and how good the food still is, the chicken gyoza is amazing"
29,Sichuan Food, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Solid place, nice interior. Food is okay but not top notch. Staff is friendly, prices are adequate."
30,Sichuan Food, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good service and food however ‚Ç¨70 Euro to share a starter and and two mains with no alcohol is over priced! Even in London!
