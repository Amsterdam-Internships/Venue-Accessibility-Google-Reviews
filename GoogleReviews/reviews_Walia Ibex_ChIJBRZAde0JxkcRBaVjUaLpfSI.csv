0,Walia Ibex, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing food!! The best Ethiopian restaurant in the city. People are also very nice and they explain everything you want to know. We‚Äôll go again for sure!!
1,Walia Ibex, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was quite good. They had combinations possible both in vegetarian and non Vegatarian meals. The portion was quite filling and the ambience was nice and quiet. Definitely recommend trying it. The vegetables were just a bit oily compared to what I have had at other places.
2,Walia Ibex, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We were not familiar with Ethiopian cuisine before so we have no prior point of reference. We ordered the vegetarian mix (Jezom bejajnetu) and meat mix (Segabejajenetu) with the flat breads. The flat bread look quite a lot like a pancake. ‚Ä¶
3,Walia Ibex, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Had Ethiopian food for the first time and me and my friends were highly impressed. The food was really good and also a unique experience to eat. The Staff was also very friendly and helped us make good choices and recommended us a variety of options. Looking forward to my next visit!
4,Walia Ibex, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"A very quaint and lovely Ethiopian place. The owners are kind and welcoming people. The good food was delicious and big portions.
Thank you for a lovely evening."
5,Walia Ibex, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very cozy place, you have vegetarian options & meat dishes. The drinks  are traditional and their üçû is something very unique. My first experience with African cuisine. Will love to be back and explore more dishes."

7,Walia Ibex, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to get introduced to the tastes of Ethiopian cuisine, you can order a meat variety and a vegetarian one on one large injera to share. Staff was friendly and food came quickly, interior can use a little revamp and a bit of coziness, but otherwise great and not very expensive."
8,Walia Ibex, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This restaurant was empty when we walked in but _definitely_ shouldn't have been, given how great the food was! The staff was very friendly (he warned us away from the spicy options and we promptly ignored him), the atmosphere was great in ‚Ä¶"
9,Walia Ibex, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent food, decent prices. Nothing spectacular. Definitely had better Ethiopian here. Service was a bit strange since the waitress definitely seemed to be at a loss, and it‚Äôs a bit bizarre that you can only order either meat or veg, and not a combination of the two. But there are worse places to eat."
10,Walia Ibex, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Ethiopian food can be a life-saving for a vegetarian in a new city. And Walia Ibex does not disappoint; excellent flavors and friendly staff, with an Ethiopian beer that goes great with the spice. We split the veg combo between the ‚Ä¶"

13,Walia Ibex, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I would give it more than 5 stars honestly. It's a real experience going there! The food is amazing and the honey wine, which they make themselves by the way, is divine. The service is so nice as well, the waiter is a saint. I will go here again when I come back to Amsterdam."
