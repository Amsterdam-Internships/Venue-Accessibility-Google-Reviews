18,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They have got a really fine selection of pastas, lassagna, spaghetti and every other italian dish you can think of. The best part about this place is that they have a lot of vegeterian and vegan options in addition to the non-vegetarian ‚Ä¶"

26,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Besides serving delicious food, I believe it is important to provide a positive experience to the customers.

47,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"I had a pasta ragu. Very nice pasta, just the ragu sauce didn't taste as the one I had in Italy."
48,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I can say you will find excellent Italian food here. Italy may be less known for desserts than pasta, so I will focus on Bonet, sweet from Piedmont. Ordered this and was pleasantly surprised. Very rich, sweet and creamy. On top of that, the waiting staff was extremely obliging! Recommended!"
49,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good Italian restaurant, a hidden Michelin star place in Groningen. Dishes freshly made and packed with flavour. Lasagnas and stews are amazing. Gnocchi a bit disappointing."

60,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food is great, the owner is great! I have had a bad experience on the telephone. The owner took it very seriously. There aren't allot of restaurantowners who serve the best italian food and take every feedback seriously. Hats off to this place!"

However, the downside is that but we had to wait more than 50 minutes for two ‚Ä¶"

63,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 1 star ,a year ago,"Was there a couple of days ago and the owner straight up screamed at a Thuisbezorgd worker. Disturbed the peace, incredibly unprofessional, all the tables were clearly very uncomfortable. Cannot tolerate such a disgusting treatment of another human being who was just clearly doing her job. Never going here again."
64,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 3 stars ,5 months ago,The food was okay. But the tiramisu was fantastic.
65,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Gustatio is just the perfect Italian restaurant. Their pasta is as authentic and Italian as the owners themselves. The food is perfect. The desserts are perfect. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and you will not be left desiring ‚Ä¶
66,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Flavorful, well-executed Italian classics (and some specials), friendly service, good atmosphere for a very decent price - we spent about ‚Ç¨30 per person here for a meal and a few drinks. Not bad eh? Goes to show the Michelin people know their stuff!"
67,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Authentic Italian cuisine cooked with fresh ingredients. No compromises made. Prices are a little higher than the average Italian place but so is the quality.
68,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The quality for the quantity and the price is not worth it. Poor wine list, almost nothing to chose from.

73,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Pretty good food, really good service"
74,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Overpriced. Avoid the Gnocchi and cheese bruschette. Time limit on tables though, which doesn't help when you're waiting around for staff to come take your order... or serve you food without giving you cutlery and then having to wait 10 ‚Ä¶"
75,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Incredible food, very fair prices.
If you get the opportunity, try and get a reservation here. You will need a reservation as it is usually full. The food is just amazing, best Italian I've had outside of Italy itself."

78,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I visited Gustatio with a friend at lunch. The menu offers some of the best value options to eat in town- the tagliatelle bolognese was delicious and only ‚Ç¨10! The pasta perfect, the meat seasoned and tender, a thoroughly enjoyable dish. ‚Ä¶"
79,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Gustatio is really an amazing place: not only it has an Italian kitchen that's incredibly delicious even for an Italian, but has also a cozy atmosphere that puts you in the best mood possible to taste a wonderfully prepared dish of true, sometimes handmade, pasta. So why exactly you should eat somewhere else?"
80,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Adding to my never-ending list of Vegetarian dishes: Gustatio, Groningen boasts an impressive vegetarian menu filled with cheesy pastas that will make you think twice. ‚Ä¶"
81,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Mama Mia! This is all what you would wish for when going for genuine Italian food. Classic Roman menu, fresh and dried pasta dishes.

82,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food is average but our vanilla ice cream tasted like garlic. We let the waiter taste it and he quickly apologised and took all the desserts back....only to realise nothing is being done about it. When I paid they asked whether we enjoyed ‚Ä¶

87,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good italian restaurant, nice place (but quite small so you'd rather book) and nice people.

94,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food and the friendliest service. The spaghetti al mare are fantastic, as are the tagliolini all'aragosta. The cannoli are to die for. Make sure to place a reservation beforehand, because the place is small and very popular!"
95,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great food and service. I even came here once late in the evening just for some ice cream. The waiter and chef were so friendly to go or of their way to make us some desert even though it was near closing time.
96,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The best food i've ever had! The price is even better! I would recommend this for sure. Good variety of italian food, no ordinary pizza's and stuff. The staff was very friendly as well. Clould'nt be any better then this"

The workers/owner(s) are really nice and super friendly.
I will visit again to try another dish!"
98,Ristorante Italiano Gustatio, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Not as I expected. Food was not so bad but quite simple. Service was a bit stressful. All places were reserved so it was a bit crowdy. Not really suitable for a romantic diner. I don't think I'll go back there.
