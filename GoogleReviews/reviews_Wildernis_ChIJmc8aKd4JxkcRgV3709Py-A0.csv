4,Wildernis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing shop to buy plants, beautiful vases, plant stands, and gardening books/tools. Great for inspiration too! It's a small shop offering local brands, so keep that in mind: the price tag is higher than the average gardening megacenters. They also offer coffee/tea and small bites, besides hosting workshops."
5,Wildernis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing little shop full of cute plants and gardening accessories from floor to ceiling. The staff is passionate and helpful. I wish they had more choices in tiny plants, there are always sold out at the end of the day!"

13,Wildernis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Beautified oasis in the Oud-West buurt (neighborhood) in Amsterdam. Not far from the Anne Frank house or Vondelpark, this is more for the ""locals"" since you won't be carrying indoor plants home on the plane! ‚Ä¶"

18,Wildernis, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I can't believe all these positive reviews! Surely the owners must have asked all their friends to write one. This shop is shockingly overrated. Yes, it is very Instagrammable indeed, but that's about it. The staff is unhelpful and ‚Ä¶"
