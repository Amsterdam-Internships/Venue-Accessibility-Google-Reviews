64,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"It is far from the best Spanish restaurant in Miami, but not bad enough to be offensive.

91,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Foodie place for sure!  A little bit of Spain in Miami.  We left with the intention of returning with our foodie friends and returning on our own over and over.  The manchego cheese with the jamon Iberico platter is a must have!
92,Pata Negra, 1 star ,a year ago,"I visit the restaurant last week. What a disaster,was going for the famous ‚Äúalmuerzo de rechupete‚Äù the fish was horrible grease, the appetizer was the worst Spanish omelette I ever had, the cochinillo was old and burn the smell was horrible ‚Ä¶"

Great place."

119,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,2 years ago,People is friendly but the food is not the best quality. I had a plate of jamon serrano and manchego cheese and the ham was not Spanish ham. It seems from the local supermarket here in Miami and the presentation was so simple that I do it ‚Ä¶

138,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Everything was great here it was very welcoming. The servers and chef was awesome!! I recommend coming here !!
139,Pata Negra, 3 stars ,5 years ago,I have heard that this place was good... so I decided to go with a few friends.... We ordered different things... some good but most of them just ok. Paella for example was very average and squid ink rice and calamari very salty... ‚Ä¶
140,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Food is good, service is very good."
141,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food...

143,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,There is just no better place to eat in Florida as if u were in authentic Spain. The black paella is w/o queation the star on a star studed menu and the bread is nit far behind. Be hungry and ready to try as much as u dare. ‚Ä¶
144,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great little place. Just went with my girlfriend and had a couple dishs. The foood was very traditional spanish tapas but we should of brang a couple more people to try some of the larger more expensive plates. Great service from all the servers though.
145,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,6 years ago,I went yesterday to the restaurant to celebrate my parents 40th anniversary and it was great!!!!! I read great reviews about the restaurant and wanted something intimate and very spanish and we were delighted that all the reviews we have ‚Ä¶
146,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Phenomenal food and service, great cozy place!!"
147,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"What a pearl!  I just discovered this place by accident.  A bit out of the way, but an absolute gem.  Best Spanish cuisine I've had since my last visit to Spain.  Small but well chosen wine list focusing on wines from Ribera del Duero. ‚Ä¶"
148,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Removed 1 star as i believe its priced too high for the quality and all hot tapas came at the same time (and got cold). Otherwise, its a very nice and authentically decorated cozy place with nice and friendly service. Food is good (not amazing)..."
149,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"It's a little small and a bit tight, but yet very cozy inside this Spaniard delicacy of a restaurant. We arrived for dinner and sat in front of the TV watching the Barcelona game while chewing on fresh bread with jam√≥n serrano and queso ‚Ä¶"
150,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Place is a littlge hidden gem - bold authentic spanish food: no hidden strings! The whole pig ( which you can order and individual piece, 1/4, 1/2 or whole !! ) - is the big star and is a must, with its own juices and delicious garlic ‚Ä¶"
151,Pata Negra, 1 star ,4 years ago,Horrible experience on my husband birthday! Cochinillo was 2 chunks of burnt fat & skin. I was served my chicken breast way before his meal & we were never told by waitress how long we had to wait for cochinillo. When i had finished my ‚Ä¶
152,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Food and service is excellent. The pig is amazing. Lunch specials are woth the trip to downtown. ‚Ä¶
153,Pata Negra, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Careful not to be given the folding table and folding chairs next to the kitchen counter - even when the restaurant is hall empty! Too noisy due to restaurant management allowing drunken customers disrupt the dining experience. Food just OK.
154,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Like Pearl! I just came across this place. It's a bit biased, but it's definitely a pearl. Since my last visit to Spain, I have enjoyed the best Spanish cuisine. A small but carefully selected list of wines devoted to the wines of Ribera ‚Ä¶"
155,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very affordable spanish restaurant, with   tasty paellas, octopus and seafood in general. The desserts are also very good. The staff is very helpfull and create a cozy family environment."

157,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Have visited this restaurant a couple of times and both times the food was excellent. The staff was great and Chef Felipe even came by to greet the table. Had various tapas including garbanzos with chorizo, mushrooms, shrimp, anchovies, ‚Ä¶"
158,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food is very delicious and authentic and by far the most attentive staff I've come across. The waiters even put together a happy anniversary celebration for my parents.
159,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cozy and warm place that unespectecly will take you to Spain with the right flavors of dishes well prepare by an authentic Spanish chef that like to welcome you personally or just approach your table to give you a warm salutation. ‚Ä¶
160,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Really good restaurant. Very tasty food and nice staff. Totally recommend it
161,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Thank you very much for this amazing dinner! The mood and the atmosphere are very warm and welcoming, like if you've been transported right to Spain. The food was incredible, the flavours so unique that reminded me my amazing trip to Spain. ‚Ä¶"
162,Pata Negra, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This place is overrated, very expensive food is not really good Normal Spanish tapas that you can eat at any Spanish restaurant in Miami for half price. Order cochinillo over cooked tasteless, Plato Ib√©rico $55.00 dollars are you serious? Wow"
163,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Amazing food, service and location!  We ate here last night and were blown away by this place.  If you want an authentic Spanish dining experience this is the place to go.  Must try:  jam√≥n Serrano, manchego cheese, sangria, and paella de mariscos."
164,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and ambiance. A bit pricey but overall good food. The place is really cold inside because the AC is controlled by the condominium where the place is, so ladies take notice. Don't complain to your man that is too cold."
165,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"They have a very affordable and delicious lunch menu (M-F I guess), in which you have 4 choices for each of two main courses and a dessert. Famed for its pricey but exquisite jam√≥n ib√©rico de bellota, which is from Jabugo (Huelva), one of the top 3 producers (if not the top 1) of this delicatessen."
166,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Finally a great Spanish restaurant in South Florida.  Worth the drive for us from Palm Beach to Miami. Great and unique jamon and tapas selection and excellent sangria. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of
167,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious Spanish food
168,Pata Negra, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Really love the flavor of paella here! Razor clam is very good in terms of flavor but a little bit over cooked. Clams should be tender and juicy.
169,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,a year ago,It is rhe restaurant with the more authentic Spanish flavor in Miami.The food is well prepared and the owner and chef is a very nice person.

172,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderfully authentic restaurant and deli. I was amazed to see that they have Jamon Iberico...the whole ham!!!  All the standard Spanish dishes were worth a try and Just fantastic.
173,Pata Negra, 1 star ,4 years ago,Trying to charge a $20 Corking fee to a resident of the Neo lofts when buying wine from his store inside the Neo lofts is bad business! After spending over 100 dollars a week on his little shop I will ever spend a penny again. Great way to show appreciation to your repeat customers.

180,Pata Negra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food was juicy and packed with flavor I suggest the cochinillo Asado en su jugo. It filled me with a great taste of Spain's quasine that you can get no whare else To my knowledge in Florida.
