0,Rembrandt Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice little bar, friendly staff and well located. The tourists loved it because when we were there you only heard foreign languages. I would recommend them."
1,Rembrandt Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here early in the morning. Good coffee, chill spot. Staff was friendly to me."
2,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,a year ago,"What a cheetah. Good beer, qood frenchfries, but extremely bad treatment. No receipt, no prices, no possibility for us to pay with a card while at the same time another local guy pays by card, an arrogant servitris wouldnt print out the …"
3,Rembrandt Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good spot. Very nice owner. Good service.
4,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very unfriendly staff especially the barkeeper who seems to spurn conversation with guests, fairly expensive even for this area and to cap it all they don't serve what the menu tells you. No recommendation at all."
5,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"AVOID! A customer complained about something, didn't hear exact what it was, but it caught my attention as the waitress stormed behind the bar in a bit of a mood. I was sat in the left hand corner of the bar so I had a good view of what she …"
6,Rembrandt Bar, 4 stars ,6 years ago,This is a great place to sit and have a couple of beers at basically any time of day. I call in pretty much every time I'm in the city (sometimes 2 or 3 times). The beer is good and the staff are pretty chilled. A perfect place to sit and watch the world go by.
7,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,10 months ago,"Worst place on Rembrandtplein. Very rude and unfriendly staff. They really don't want you there. Save yourself trouble and go to any other terrace on Rembrandtplein, but not this one."
8,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"7.50€ for a “pint” of Amstel that was one-third foam. This is a place that is a complete rip-off compared to other bars nearby. I would be interested to learn what the locals get charged here. There were no prices on the “beer and cider” menu, which is odd."
9,Rembrandt Bar, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good vibes!
10,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Obviously a great location, but with the worst service. Bartender was only busy with talking to his mates. We were watching the replays and world cup trophy ceremony after the match (France - Croatia) when he just decided to turn the TV …"
11,Rembrandt Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good place, fair prices, good vibe"
12,Rembrandt Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I had a great time at this bar with a group of lads on a stag weekend. Sat outside in the sun in Rembrandt Square, the service was decent and the prices reasonable. The toilet left a lot to be desired however."
13,Rembrandt Bar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Decent bar. Staff are really friendly. Nice outdoor seating. Food looks not bad I never tried it. Nice location too. Beer was really nice.
14,Rembrandt Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Sat down, browsed the menu and waited for a server to finally come to take my order. I waited and waited... Then I saw that the bar next door had a friendly and attentive server so went there instead and got my drinks!"
15,Rembrandt Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I stopped by with a friend for some night coffee and it was great to observe the street movement! The vibe was so nice we stayed for more than two hours and left almost midnight.
16,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Yea the tall bald guy behind the bar was pretty rude, didn’t get a welcoming vibe here. If you’re an American traveler who’s a POC just beware, this seems like it’s more of a local hangout."
17,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"How this place is still running is beyond me. The food was shockingly bad and to top it off, I found an insect in my meal. Naively decided to let the server know so she would replace the dish, instead got told to pay and leave. Bizarre."
18,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Really rude waiter made us leave the restaurant. Nice spot but go to a nicer place where your business is appreciated
19,Rembrandt Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Heineken and Amstel, but very expensive."
20,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,This bar is Nazi sympathizers. We watched them allow a Nazi come in and threaten and remove a person of color and the management didn't care. Never support nor give money
21,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Location ok, but the food is very low quality, the staff is fake friendly and mixed the order. Not recommendable place."
22,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible food and not a nice place to eat or relax. Rude staff especially the fat lady.
23,Rembrandt Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice for breakfast. We got a traditional ham and cheese omelette during our stay. Very nice.
24,Rembrandt Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty decent food and nice outdoor seating area just a few steps away from the Rembrandt house, overlooking the canal and street market."
25,Rembrandt Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The bar is okay, but nothing special and high in price. Touristic place in general like most spots at Rembrandt square"
26,Rembrandt Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"They kick us out because we come with small dog and we didnt see that dogs are not allowed,man was really rude and unpolite!!!!!"
