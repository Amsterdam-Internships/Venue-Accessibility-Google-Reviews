0,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"This was the one place I always had to go when I was in town. Losing it to a fire was heartbreaking and for years I went without delicious cheap salads. There just was no other substitute. Then it came back and it was just as good as we all remembered. HUGE portions, fresh ingredients, homemade bread, and those dressings?!. Yes please."
1,Mezzo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"A delightful space with friendly staff, lots of natural light, and amazing food. Prices are super reasonable, especially for how much food you get! I'd recommend going with the half & half — it's $12 without tax and you get to choose 2 out …"
2,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Impressive. The freshness and generosity of portions is worth the wait. The serving sizes can easily be shared. The bread is amazing. Each order is prepared on the spot. There is a parking garage one block towards the campus.
3,Mezzo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Came here because my friend raved about their honey bread. We already ate before coming so we didn't want to order a proper meal but we wanted to try their bread. The cashier recommended the $1 bread end bag. It is this giant bag of fresh …
4,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"bussin respectfully. The portions are gigantic, hearty, and satisfying. Bread choices are always fun and fresh, the marinated tofu is a personal favorite. Can’t miss this place, and I’m glad it’s back open."
5,Mezzo, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Friendly, responsive staff.  Prompt service.  Delicious food.  Good value.  Always a pleasure going to Intermezzo!  Quickly becomes a new favorite of friends and family who try it. …"
6,Mezzo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I was never a salad person until i ate one here! Be prepared for a possible line at the door. It moves fast and let me tell you, be ready for a 2 to 3 lb salad! Comes with some fruit and a nice piece of fresh bread. Their sandwiches are amazing also. Well worth the time it takes to find parking lol."
7,Mezzo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A Berkeley stalwart for decades. Reliably good sandwiches and salads. The house-made, thick-sliced breads are consistently good. Although the sandwich ingredients aren't top quality, the sum of the parts is very satisfying. The half …"
8,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If I were on a deserted Island with only 1 restaurant to go to for the rest of my life, Mezzo would be the one. It is my dream girl of restaurants. Checks all my boxes and makes me feel both good and satisfied. …"
9,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A really cool, easily accessible, trendy spot in downtown Berkeley with excellent, organic foods! …"
10,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Sandwiches and vibe are great. Perfect place to go after hiking in the Oakland hills! Their artichoke sourdough is BOMB.
11,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Food is fresh and super tasty. They have big portions as well! If you have a nut allergy, this might not be a place for you. But I'm sure the workers can accommodate and offer a dish specially prepared. Staff is super nice and patient. This place can be very crowded during prime time hours, plan according."
12,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My love for Cafe Mezzo goes way back to my undergrad days (‘99-‘03).  It used to called Cafe Intermezzo but sadly it perished in a fire.  They rebuilt and it’s still just as awesome. This restaurant offers a large variety of very healthy …
13,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is my absolute favorite place in the UC Berkeley campus area. There’s so much good food everywhere but nowhere serves better and healthier salads than this place. For only $13.95, you can get an enormous chefs salad with garbanzo …"
14,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Very nice and big salads can be used for two meals. The coffee is also very nice.
15,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Best salads in the Bay Area. Veggie delight with green goddess dressing is especially spectacular! Large portions too
16,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Stopped in at lunchtime for a cool drink and a quiet chat. The mint lemonade was delicious and the outdoor dining area was shady and quiet enough to chat despite the lunch rush. It's very popular at lunchtime, so be prepared to stand in line for a few minutes before entering."
17,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Salads are enormous! I get the half-sandwich half-salad option, and even after a 40-mile bike ride, it hits the spot! …"
18,Mezzo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"If you like large soup and/or salad portions, this place is for you. The bread slices are sliced thicker than you’re used to.  This place gets busy at the lunch and dinner hours but you can call in your order."
19,Mezzo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ordered this to go and took it without checking because I was in a rush and the workers were stacked the day I ordered this. I got home to find out that my sandwich was missing a whole piece of bread. In fact, the whole sandwich seems like …"
20,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved the service and vibe. However, it's kinda messy. Maybe have a garbage can in sight so people are not as sloppy with their mess. The sandwich was delectable, though I wish I could have had my bread toasted. Salad was ok, nothing too …"
21,Mezzo, 5 stars ,a month ago,Mezzos probably has the highest taste to value rating of any restaurant in Southside.  Highly recommended!
22,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing bread and gigantic salad. Tasty kombucha. The Greek goddess and poppy seed dressing are just awesome. The honey wheat bread is spectacular. One of the top salad and sandwich places anywhere. Consider splitting with a friend.
23,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great salad and bread for price. Personally would like more salad options than those I find at a college cafeteria salad bar (kidney beans, lettuce, alfalfa stouts, hard-boiled eggs, tuna), but great people."
24,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Big salads, best poppy seed dressing. I was heartbroken after it closed from the fire and so excited to come back and see it better than ever. Such great new seating and patio! At half my salad before taking a picture cause it was so good!"
25,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Huge portions with fresh ingredients. Busy but efficient so line moves quickly. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.
26,Mezzo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food options, such as complicated toast, breakfast burritos, salads and sandwiches. A bit pricey, but the ingredients are good. Though the black beans are weak. …"
27,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Needed a vegetable dish that was fulfilling  after eating nothing but carb based foods for 5 days. Insert the combo plate, half Berkeley Special and toss salad with herb vinegar based dressing."
28,Mezzo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Back as a student, this was unquestionably one of my favorite restaurants in Berkeley! I remember taking a few family members here when they visited and they were impressed with the cordial atmosphere and the delicious sandwiches. One of my …"
29,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Fresh & plentiful salad & a slice of their delicious homemade bread. So nice to sit outside on the patio.
30,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Salads bigger than your head!!! Stop wasting time looking at reviews and go eat here!!! Food is amazing, fresh, and consistently delicious. Nice selection of fresh juices and yummy coffee. The staff is always friendly and super …"
31,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you were visiting Berkeley, you need to try out café Mezzo. You can get a great big bowl of delicious leafy greens mixed with your choice of poppyseed to their homemade green goddess dressing. The salad has a delicious mixture of …"
32,Mezzo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Huge fresh sandwiches, with really fresh ingredients, that can last two meals. Tofu filling is delicious. …"
33,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The salad was as big as my head and it was incredibly delicious. I'll definitely be stopping by again the next time I'm in town.
34,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 months ago,I dream of all my sandwiches being this great. I loved every bite. Fresh and delicious;).
35,Mezzo, 1 star ,7 months ago,"I hadn't been to Mezzo in over a year.  A few days ago I stopped in to pick up a salad.  As I was checking out, I noticed the cashier was not wearing a mask.  Then I realized none of the employees wore masks.  Given the Delta variant which …"
36,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such great food and variety of sandwiches. The sandwiches are large with thick delicious breads. Consider getting a half sandwich with a salad. Yummy kambucha and aguas frescas.
37,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The salad and sandwich I had at this cafe was delicious. It was my first time eating at this cafe. This place has a great atmosphere. Well done!
38,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Great sandwiches and salads at a goid price
39,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Fresh ingredients ,portions as insanely large as they have always been. Essentially, two meals in one."
40,Mezzo, 5 stars ,a month ago,10/10 breakfast burritos. Add avocado for smoothness.
41,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love this place. I hadn't been here since it burnt down years ago, and while the inside is completely transformed, the food is just the same and just as delicious. I got the veggie delight with poppy seed dressing. Comes with a whole …"
42,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Added sprouts to the BLAT to make a BLAST. It was amazing and HUGE! Loved this place. Will be back for sure!!
43,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,My all time favorite salad spot in Northern California! I'm so glad that they opened back up in June!
44,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very delicious food. Large serving for an excellent price!
45,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Huge salads and sandwiches at reasonable prices.  With every gigantic salad,  you get a slice of bread and a piece of pineapple.  I always get the chef's salad with marinated tofu, hold the sprouts. …"
46,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Oh my goodness. 🥰 I love it!!!
47,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"YUM!!! My friend took me to this place when I visited and it was so good! Super cute, casual shop. Super clean interior and spacious. Pretty busy especially at lunchtime but tables clear out relatively quickly. Located in downtown Berkeley …"
48,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best, biggest salad or sandwich you'll get in Berkeley. this is classic veggie faire from way before current day vegans were born. The recipes (yum! poppy seed dressing! Yum homemade croutons! Yum warm homemade whole wheat bread! …"
49,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had lunch here with my daughter. Their chicken salad is delicious!!!! This was my 1st time here. Their wheat bread is HUGE!!! You can't get half a sandwich, a whole sandwich was too much for me at one sitting. I'll definitely go back again. Always love trying new places with my daughter."
50,Mezzo, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Consistently great food, but recently the staff seems very new and inexperienced (slow + got our order wrong twice)."
51,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Sooooooooooo glad they are back!!! Great food and portions! Super fresh and healthy! Best poppyseed dressing ever! My life is complete again :) lol
52,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Mezzo is one of my favorite places to eat in Berkeley. their portions are huge and delicious so i definitely feel like i am getting more than my money's worth. there has been a few times when i have some leftover salad but you can ask for a …
53,Mezzo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Warning: service here is super variable. If you order the same thing every time, you will undoubtedly get a different sandwich each time (in regards to quantity of ingredients, how the sandwich is put together). People enjoy the big …"
54,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very spacious place with big windows, tasty sandwiches and super friendly staff."
55,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,After a day of travel from the East coast this was the sandwich and drink my body needed. Great atmosphere and food.
56,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome! Huge salad portions, most of my friends could not finish portion because of sheer size. It's very good. But bread and infusion were especially amazing. It's also not rock bottom cheap like some could think looking as single $ sign …"
57,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,In general expect a moderate wait for monstrously portioned and pretty decent salads and sandwiches. They are made by a very frazzled staff dealing with a large line that are prone to making mistakes in your order if not carefully watched. …
58,Mezzo, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Great meal-sized salads and sandwiches in a hip environment with a large outdoor patio. Unfortunately though, they use sugar and canola oil in the dressings and breads. Canola oil is rapeseed marketed to us in a ""heart-healthy"" disguise. …"
59,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Better than the original with essentially identical menu. I still love it 20 years after my student days. The homemade multigrain bread is great as are all the sandwiches. My favorites are turkey, chicken salad, and peanut …"
60,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"HUGE salads! First time my wife couldn't finish it. Seriously shocking. I had a tuna fish sandwich and added bacon. Wow...delicious. Many choices of fresh bread. Great, healthy and communal place to relax and eat. Only wish I took a couple pics."
61,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The line will always be long, but it's entirely worth it. It always has been as far as I can remember. They have a great selection of different sandwiches and salads. Soups are limited, but not why I go there anyway. The sandwiches are made …"
62,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really enjoyed the sandwich. Everything was super fresh, from the meat, to the veggies, and to the bread. The sandwich quality is definitely way better than their soup. New restaurant so it the line was a little chaotic. But I'm sure …"
63,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was a regular in the previous incarnation of Mezzo, back in the 90s, and couldn't get enough of their immense salads and hearty hummus sandwiches. I don't live in the area anymore, but whenever I visit I am drawn to Mezzo. The food is …"
64,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Spot on what i expected and wanted from one of Berkeley's landmark restaurants. If you're from around here, you've been here. The bread is thick, soft and satisfying. Salads feels good and bigger than your head. Come and eat. Walk out feeling satisfied in your belly and healthier overall."
65,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"When I arrived at Mezzo, former Intermezzo (Thank God they reopened it!), it was a bit past 8pm, so I avoided lines and crowds and was able to get a nice seat. I decided to go for Veggie Delight and Chicken Salad and I got it with lots of …"
66,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Want a really good, huge salad? Mezzo is your spot. It's clean, efficient, and the value is off the charts. They aren't organic, but at this price, that's to be expected. …"
67,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a 1.5mi round-trip from my office that I happily make at least once a week. The salads are proportionally made for giants (not at all a complaint). I usually go with a chef salad/blue cheese/tuna salad and have never been let down …
68,Mezzo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Not really my favorite. Thought it would be better due to the reviews but my tuna sandwich looked and felt like I was eating leftovers. Even the plate was dirty when I received it. …
69,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I've been here before and after the fire.  The food has stayed the same.  My fave is still their chef salad with the poppyseed dressing.  The added bonus is that the bar next door is cool with you eating your salad there.
70,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Giant delicious salads and hearty soups.  I've heard their sandwiches are good too. Don't let a long line deter you; it moves fast. My favorite place to eat out for quick and healthy
71,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A Berkeley institution: affordably feeding students and visitors, alike, for decades (if you include the building that burned down). The rebuild is even better than before but prices are still great. …"
72,Mezzo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Delicious, huge salad. Definitely two meals."
73,Mezzo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Long line that moves fast. Great food, huge portions."
74,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Can't say enough good things about this place. Fresh food, delicious food, friendly service, good location, close Berkeley campus."
75,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,There is often a long line at noon but the line moves pretty quickly so it never takes too long. Their sandwiches are some of the best in Berkeley. They're huge and I highly recommend the BLAT (bacon lettuce avocado tomato). The prices are about what you'd expect for the quality and the cafe has a nice modern aesthetic.
76,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I cannot go to the Bay without a sandwich and a salad! The portions are huge, but it's great to have the leftovers in the morning! The bread is amazing and the poppy seed dressing can't be beat!"
77,Mezzo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We got there a bit after 10am. We wanted a salad but they told us they didn't do salads until 10:30am. Once 10:30am came, they told us their internet was down and they couldn't take orders since it's a card only place. They offered to take …"
78,Mezzo, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The food is pretty good and the ambience is nice, but it's off-putting that none of the staff wears masks."
79,Mezzo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Lots and lots of salad. Good for a quick bite.
80,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Salads and sandwiches are always ample and delicious.   The homemade wheat bread is fresh and tasty.       The Thai Udon soup wasn't anything to write home about.  Everything else has always been delicious, look forward to coming back often to grab lunch or dinner."
81,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super breakfast burrito,  you're able to select what you want for 7 bucks!"
82,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Yummy healthy sandwiches, soups, and salads. Portions are huge so you can save for a later meal. Great coffee too! You can sit in a nice outdoor patio and the restrooms are gender neutral!!"
83,Mezzo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Huge salad portions and delicious coffee at a reasonable price (for the Berkeley area). Extremely popular with both students and locals bring enormous lines that can take up to 30 minutes to get served during peak hours. Comfortable seating both indoors and out make this a great place to post up to get work done or just to hang out.
84,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing place to stop for lunch. Huge sandwiches for a reasonable price, and the ingredients are obviously very fresh. The service is fantastic, with all the workers clearly happy and excited to be doing what they're doing. Would highly recommend!"
85,Mezzo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"unnecessarily large portions of fairly plain veggies and bland dressing. I would gladly pay the $9.50 for a salad 1/2 the size with a bit more complexity. Pretty much a giant bowl of iceberg, romaine, cabbage , chickpeas, cherry tomatoes, …"
86,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for sandwiches and salads! It's also a bargain. $10 for either a massive salad or sandwich that could last two meals. I always find their creations delicious and is a great place to grab and go or sit down.
87,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Sort of limited menu, but the quality of dishes offered makes up for it. Excellent building, lots of seating space and a great outdoor area/beer garden. Come here for a casual Meetup or just for a quick snack"
88,Mezzo, 5 stars ,a year ago,My favorite sandwich place in Berkeley! I always get the tofu sandwich. Love the pineapple slice you get with every order!
89,Mezzo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I ordered the veggie delight yesterday. The place is dirty and unsanitary, they mix all the salads in the same bowl. I’ve been violently ill with food poisoning for the past eight hours."
90,Mezzo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This was a favorite restaurant years ago b4 the building burned down. I was delighted to find they rebuilt and reopened. They have big salads but not as big as b4. Thier salads, soup, sandwiches and homemade breads are so delicious and …"
91,Mezzo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Came here as I was told it was vegan friendly. The staff didn't seem to have a solid understanding of what vegan food is, and that caused some slight confusion. In the end there was only one menu item that was actually vegan. The save and …"
92,Mezzo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious and Humongous sandwich!! -even for a big guy. Perfect coffee!
93,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"SOUP. SANDWICH. SALAD.

They do it well, food looks really fresh, you can see them prepare it for you. …"
94,Mezzo, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Popular lunch and breakfast spot, close to campus."
95,Mezzo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"1st In 3-4 years very satisfied, Today the person who made my salad barely filled my to go salad to the top.  She had the nerve to take some of the salad out of the bowl.Then  I asked for a side of Chicken Salad and she gave me one small …"
96,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cafe Mezzo is a great place for everyone's appetite! If I was you I would try it, at least to say you did. That's what I did, and love is the very first moment I took a bite am I fresh tuna salad sandwich."
97,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This was a fantastic find after a 6 mile hike.
Great fresh food and such a deal for so much goodness..."
98,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Like it never burned down! Finally got a chance to visit for the first time since it re-opened and it did not disappoint. I used to love this place and was heart broken when I found out it burned down. The veggie delight tasted as good as …
99,Mezzo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It's now 9.50 for a veggie delight but otherwise the salad is the same size. Recently they've changed the poppuseed dressing for the worse - no longer a fan and can't find a suitable substitute. Vinaigrette is too sweet and the …
100,Mezzo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great sandwiches, but the soups are a hit-or-miss. Today my soup had raw onions and was inedible! The coffee is reliably terrible."
101,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"we only had a fruit juice, but i liked the environment and salads the other tables were having looked tasty. The menu seemed pricey, but i suppose it is alogned with the san francisco bay prices."
102,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I go to Mezzo with my dad when he visits. They have huge salads and sandwiches for around $11. The food quality is great and the staff is friendly.
103,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing sandwiches!! (they are huge and super fresh!!) Friendly staff and reasonable prices ! This place is super packed at meal times and for good reason. Definitely worth a visit if you are in UC Berkeley!
104,Mezzo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Despite being given a togo box covered in various sauces, toppings, and dressings I didn't order, Madison refused to give me a new one saying it would just get dirty from the gloves. She also said the person preparing the food would not be …"
105,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is great. The salads are literally large enough to feed a family of 4. The ingredients used are the best quality that you can find.
106,Mezzo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Overpriced and not anywhere near the original quality. Staff was mostly impatient and overworked.
Manager fired a friend after she followed directions on reporting an employee …"
107,Mezzo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Salad barely mixed. Greek yogurt is made with cilantro which completely ruined it for me. They also include a massive chunk of bread. Hard to imagine anyone actually eating that much bread so likely leads to lots of waste.
108,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A couple main options to choose from, but I usually go with the half sandwich/half salad with the option to add turkey or ham. The poppy seed dressing is one of a kind along with the honey wheat bread."
109,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Giant fresh salads that are delicious and impossible for one person to finish. The fresh baked honey wheat bread used for salads and sandwiches is also amazingly good.
110,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food with big portions. Love how they make a lot of their stuff in house (bread, salad dressings, marinate their tofu, pickle their pickles, etc.) The line may be long but the workers are working their butt off to make sure it moves fast!"
111,Mezzo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Rude cashier whwn I asked for a water glass . the girl tbat made made sandwhich was pissed because I asked for onion and she said were out . i asked her to check the back and she rolled her eyes and asked a guy he laughed and said no. After …
112,Mezzo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, but owner should take a supply chain management class. Employees don't seem to operate with any sense of urgency and the output is extremely slow and unoptimized. Eat here only if you are okay waiting for an excessive amount of time."
113,Mezzo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,*I am open—and hopeful—that I will be able to justifiably modify this review at a later time. …
114,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Huge, loaded salads for well under $10. Mezzo was closed for a few years after a fire, but it's back and even better than before. The redesigned space is much better than the old version."
115,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I like to go to this place to get a nice light sandwich or salad for lunch. Their prices are on the expensive side but the food is usually pretty good and the service is very fast. The place is not usually very crowded so the wait time is not very long.
116,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Following my own precedent, i give a place 5 stars if it's got a delicious, cheap, filling item, even if some other aspects are a letdown. So while the lunch sandwiches arent great, the breakfast burrito is top notch"
117,Mezzo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Food is good tasting... Just all the staff weird me out. A. College kids and hygiene....im not sure, B. Hippies and hygiene..... im not sure, C. Berkeley in general.....I usually feel like Im stuck in hell till I get back to the freeway..."
118,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Conclusion First
- The only flaw is a long waiting line. Avoid peak hours then you will be happy with zero complaint. …"
119,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absurdly large salads and sandwiches. My favourite is the half sandwich half salad combo with a BLTA on honey wheat and poppyseed dressing, but honestly you can't go wrong. Everything is super great!"
120,Mezzo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A huge tossed salad that can feed 3! Lots of light adjacent to a the Raleigh bar.  Telegraph ave seems to be changing,  but it's coming slowly. Not the vibrant street that it was in the 70's and 80's."
121,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We were visiting UC Berkeley with our daughter and a student guide recommended Mezza. OMG! The best wheat bread..and the sandwiches and salads are massive and tasty. Highly recommend
122,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I was here 30 years ago and it is phenomenal.
The staff was super friendly and extremely professional. The bread is magnificent. Every ingredients was fresh and carefully prepared.
I love love this place."
123,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wayyy too much delicious bread, but otherwise very tasty. The vegan chili was super. Also a bit pricey but maybe normal for Berkeley."
124,Mezzo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Salads are huge, but I would prefer the protein to not be cold. Others may not mind. Overall a good choice for a healthy meal considering the choices in the area"
125,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cafe Mezzo is a hip and trendy restaurant next to the UC Berkeley campus.  If you order a salad be ready, they are huge."
126,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best damn salads ever. So glad they're back after all these years. Tossed green with poppyseed dressing is the way to go. And the bread is rad! 😜
127,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It's good! I recommend the regular green salad? With the poppyseed dressing and some beans. Great service fresh food kinda pricey
128,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"So so so good. Humongous salads, tons of vegetarian and vegan options plus plenty of tasty salad options for us carnivores. Just like the original, but even better."
129,Mezzo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great salads and sandwiches at this incredibly popular spot. I'm glad it is back after a long hiatus in a gorgeous new space, go at lunch only if you like incredibly long lines."
130,Mezzo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Eat here. Stop what you're doing and order some food here. Ditch class. Ditch work. Come here.
131,Mezzo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The Italian salami sandwich is pretty good!
132,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome fresh baked honey wheat bread and poppy seed dressing. I always stop here when I'm in the area but beware...they run out of sandwiches in the evening.
133,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Always blown away by the portion size and the freshness! Still one of my favorite places in my hometown! Have you ever had an artichoke loaf?
134,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely amazing. I love the salads and sandwiches. I have yet to try their soups but everything else is bomb.
135,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I used to love this place when it was Intermezzo years ago. It’s still good, but now they only accept credit cards (no cash), which insures no pesky homeless or poor people will bother you while you’re munching on your BLTA."
136,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great experience! The tall guy with blonde hair(barista/cashier) was super sweet, and made a great almond latte🤤"
137,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love their salads, was sad when building burned down a couple years ago. ...but excited when it re-opened, still the best salads around!"
138,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place..a bit overcrowded at times but makes sense with the influx of people.. Their salad with poppy seed dressing is amazing,and the value for money is good..I hope they consider opening more outlets.."
139,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,By far the best salads and sandwiches in Berkeley!!! Huge portions of super fresh and yummy food :))) (chocolate chip cookie is out of this world !!!)
140,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,huge portion + super friendly
141,Mezzo, 5 stars ,a month ago,"So happy this place is open again. Breakfast burritos are delicious, and the enormous salads and homemade bread are what put this place on the map. Go hungry!"
142,Mezzo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great food busy and long lines but great
143,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The old Intermezzo, but larger and brighter.  Same poppyseed dressing, wedge (can't be called a slice) of bread, and yummy but traditional veggies.  It just works."
144,Mezzo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great breakfast choices.  Highly recommend the breakfast burritos with lots of ingredient choices or the Avocado Toast.  Out of this world.
145,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome , wholesome and great staff. Their bread is fluffy and tasty on its own. Worth every penny...or electronic penny as they don't take cash."
146,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Intermezzo. Reborn. With beer next door. Portions very generous, fresh house made bread to die for. Why are you reading a review? Go eat!"

151,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Half of a Turkey sandwich with bacon added
152,Mezzo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The sandwich was huge and so good! Ingredients are fresh and the honey wheat bread is the best!
153,Mezzo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is just OK. The place is quite unclean: dirty tables, trashed floor, nasty toilets.
Prices are definitely high for the quality of the products and the place. Not suggested."
154,Mezzo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best place for a nice meal that is well served.
155,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Mezzo is in its own category.  Until you have been there you've never had a salad quite like that.  Hope you're hungry!
156,Mezzo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Mezzo is famous for good reason. I just wish their soup portions were as generous as their salad and sandwich portions

165,Mezzo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Big portion of salad and sweat bread. If you can't finish it, you can keep it in a box"
166,Mezzo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Clean space, fresh ingredients and friendly service. Prices are on the more expensive side for a quick lunch, but well worth it."
167,Mezzo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome feel and great prices for large portions, but not as good as the gourmet salad places"
168,Mezzo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Really bad stomach aches after the only two times I ate here. It was the only food I ate differently than the rest of my family and they were all fine.
