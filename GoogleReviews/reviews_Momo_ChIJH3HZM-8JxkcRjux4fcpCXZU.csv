0,Momo, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Nice vibe. We went on a Sunday so music was not so loud and you can have a good chat. We had dinner by the bar and the bartender was nice the Italian guy :) . I would say they should include some salads on the menu like the spinach salad ‚Ä¶
1,Momo, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"What a night! Lotte welcomed us and took us to the perfect table for out party. Emily and Ayesha made us the best cocktails ever and Doville and her team treated us like royalty. And kitchen ruined food from other places forever. Thank you, team MOMO, see you soon! Hope I remembered the names correctly, because y'all rock!"
2,Momo, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Food and atmosphere are 5 stars,  narrow place to eat though"
3,Momo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,One of the most eye pleasing foods that you are going to eat. Great serves.
4,Momo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great Japanese fusion restaurant, the food is delicious and vibes are fun."
5,Momo, 1 star ,a month ago,Awful Place. They placed us at the entrance but I made a reservation 1 month ago. My wife couldnt sit there because the wind was so cold. Awful and unfriendly service offered no solution and also the music is a way to loud for a dinning ‚Ä¶
6,Momo, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"The place has a good vibe during the weekends. Food is mediocre and overpriced. Small selection of sushi but really nothing special. Black cod is good, side dishes are not. I thing they made the rice few days ago, it's dry and there is ‚Ä¶"
7,Momo, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Tasty food, but very small portions, high prices and most of all very slow service‚Ä¶.. very slow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."

9,Momo, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"As a vegetarian I loved their avocado pieces, very cool atmosphere, cool cocktails, I had the ‚ÄòQuiet Angel‚Äô one and it was very niceüëºüèªwould recommend for drinks and sushi!"
10,Momo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great service and amazing food!
11,Momo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"One of my favorite restaurants. The quality of the sushi you will find here is exceptional. I definitely recommend visiting at least for a lunch, and going all in for a dinner :)"
12,Momo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Fine Japanese dining. Great food experience
I tried their set menu no. 3 which is incredible with amazing variety. highly recommended and will definitely visit again"
13,Momo, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Been here a few times, unfortunately never again. Food is great, but has a really arrogant evening hostess that even refused to call the manger so she doesn‚Äôt look bad. As an investor in the hospitality, ‚Ä¶"

Called them for a reservation, and we even arrived 20 minutes early and our ‚Ä¶"
15,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Momo is an interesting restaurant with very good sushi and steaks. The prices are high, but if you take in consideration the taste and the menu, you can say that is equal. Also, the cocktails are super well done, with a beautiful ‚Ä¶"
16,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent Asian Fusion-style restaurant. Made reservation same day for 8 people with 4 children. ‚Ä¶
17,Momo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food and waitor marred by reception. Had a lovely lunch here for 2 - cocktails were delicious, food was very tasty and our waitor  was very helpful and attentive. However, the blonde receptionist was frosty and hung our wet coats on 1 ‚Ä¶"
18,Momo, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Very expensive wines and food leveraging on a very inauthentic look and feel.

They clearly employ models to give the impression that this is a cool place ‚Ä¶"
19,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The Momo restaurant is located in the museum district close to pretty much everything in Amsterdam from a tourist perspective. ‚Ä¶
20,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"pricy and little portion , but the experience is good. The way to cook is very Asian, but more arty than most traditional Chinese and japanese restaurants. Involving some creative ideas."
21,Momo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Expensive food. But fantastic food!
Service was friendly but can be improved. We waited 30minutes for our drinks‚Ä¶"
22,Momo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's expensive, but if you enjoy Asian cuisine it's worth the cost. Try ordering a few plates to split among your group, you'll get to try more that way. And grab some mochi to finish, you WON'T regret it."
23,Momo, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"I went to Momo  for dinner a couple of times. Good food and good overall service. However, the host and manager are arrogant and unhelpful. I asked for a dessert to take to my room at the Park Centraal Armsterdam, and all they could say is that it was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù. I will not dine there the rest of my stay."
24,Momo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Loved the vibes and food.
25,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Highly recommend the tasting menu.  All the dishes are unique and fun and portion size is perfect.
26,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place! it's really cool. If you like Japanese food and cocktails, then go.
also they got a Do, who was playing during the dinner.
Not a place for families."
27,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place wit good food. Try the slow cooked Iberico Ribs, sushi or sweet patato fries. Place is quiet expensive but food and service is high end and definitely worth it."
28,Momo, 1 star ,2 months ago,Really snobby and rude waiters waited 45 minutes for them to take our order and when I asked someone if we could order I was abruptly told we‚Äôre very busy the waiter will be with you when he can..just super disappointing I wanted to treat ‚Ä¶
29,Momo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Tried the dessert only, the chocolate lava cake. While the cake itself came out warm and moist, the flavour was very average. Green tea was a good combination, but the crispy sesame topper, while a great idea, was just annoying to eat and constantly sticking to teeth. Dessert was ok. Service was slow (even to get the bill)."
30,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food but a bit pricey - still hungry after ‚Ç¨220 (for 2 people including 4 cocktails in fairness)! Staff were lovely and very attentive.
31,Momo, 1 star ,8 months ago,"We had a tasting menu, little dishes of high quality Japanese food. All was good, but when the dessert came we started checking for a hidden camera (seriously did that). A huge eclair. This doesn‚Äôt fit in a tasting menu let alone a Japanese restaurant. Destroyed the experience, won‚Äôt come back."
32,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A good spot for an upscale lunch. This modern and chic restaurant puts out some high-quality pan-Asian fusion, with separate lunch and dinner menus. It feels more like a restaurant in America than Europe, and the service was quite good. Definitely recommend for a tasty lunch."
33,Momo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Expensive, but great location, good food, music and decor. A bit loud, so choose for a party mood."
34,Momo, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The disco music (with DJ) is way too loud and does not fit the restaurant. Like having dinner in a club, you can barely hear the person across the table. Food/drink quality is great, but it's (too) expensive. Service is good and personal. ‚Ä¶"
35,Momo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great tasting experience!
36,Momo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The venue is rammed full of people desperate to be at the 'in' place, a group, a large proportion I am sure have no idea or interest in good food. That being said the food is good, very over priced, but good. The staff carry a dismissive ‚Ä¶"
37,Momo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We had breakfasts here with my 9 years daughter. Wondelpark breakfast menu was wonderful. In time of Covid everything packed individually. For me as a doctor it is very important! ‚Ä¶
38,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, good service  Nice DJ and great ambiance. One of my favourites lounge   bars/ restaurants in Amsterdam. Extreme good location as well. Hint: make reservations, its always packed here. Pretty expensive but again, you also receive were you are paying for!"
39,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great flavors, service, and atmosphere. A la carte or fixed menu."
40,Momo, 1 star ,7 months ago,I booked through google and no where does it specify that theres a dress code. The hostess kept looking at us from head to toe and instead of telling us outright that we are too underdressed she continuous to look until im soo uncomfortable ‚Ä¶
41,Momo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Arrived after 15:00, lunch was closed, so I had a quick one at the bar, lobster sushi and prawns are quite good."
42,Momo, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Food hasnt been the same as it used to be - neither the ambiance. Was there on a Thursday night. Music wasnt great either - has lost its spark for me.
43,Momo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Super overall experience, great service (thank you Tom!!), incredible food and a great atmosphere! ‚Ä¶"
44,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had some amazing food here - our group ordered off the pre-selected menu and it didn't disappoint.  Be sure to book a reservation in advance as it gets quite busy.
45,Momo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"My favorite sushi place in Amsterdam. Great atmosphere and location. Do not miss the yellowtail, salmon avocado ceviche, wagyu roll, or the filet of beef. If you order a set menu, the chef will make real wasabi at the table for you. Quite an experience."
46,Momo, 1 star ,8 months ago,"The worst restaurant. Paying for the meal after eating 3 hairs IN A SINGLE ROLL, inadmissible. Server worse than unpleasant. Their only concern was to hide this disaster as quickly as possible. Run as quick as you can!"
47,Momo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very nice place with a nice atmosphere. The food was great and my drink too. Very much recommend.
48,Momo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Fantastic Japanese. Very interesting dishes with a flair for dramatic. Music can be loud as acoustics are not great.
49,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food , good service."
50,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food nice service but the seating is not so comfortable
51,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great cocktails, superb food"
52,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere and warm welcome. It was between meal service times, so we could only order from the snacks menu. We had the duck spring rolls, all the mini tacos, sweet potato fries and some sushi rolls. Everything was great and super ‚Ä¶"
53,Momo, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The place and Food was Nice, however its a little pricey. We booked a table for 2 for my Boyfriends Birthday but we were not able to celebrate it well. The Music is just too loud that we both need to shout just to hear each other. We ended ‚Ä¶"
54,Momo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cool hip food and people... A bit noisy.
55,Momo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice atmosphere, good food, good service."
56,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent service , cocktails are amazing ambiance and music is good"
57,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great Canadian waitress, really took great care of our large party. we didnt need to look up she kept our glasses full and the food she served was delicious. Its quite a busy restaurant I would recommend for groups not for intimate dinners for two."
58,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. Don‚Äôt forget to try a black cod.
59,Momo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Very tastful, nice atmosphere, bit pricy"
60,Momo, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Very good food
61,Momo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Besides the strange email about their service times and that we had to eat quickly, we were never chased. The food was absolutely amazing and really enjoyed every bite. I think they under estimated our group size and we weren‚Äôt able to ‚Ä¶"
62,Momo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Decent place for lunch with good cocktails. It's kind of mid-high end Asian. Had the sushi & was alright. Giving 3 stars for the oily smell that came on constantly from the kitchen as if we're in China town small restaurant. Felt i smell of oil for the rest of the day!
63,Momo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Chef‚Äôs fixed menu was overall great, but a few dishes (duck, steak) were almost underwhelming considering the assumed caliber of the restaurant. The desserts were lovely and they did a great job making me a lactose free option that was as good as or better than the regular dish."
64,Momo, 1 star ,a year ago,"been here many time but this time we got kicked out after 2 hours so new people could come in. the course took two hours and after the main, they just brought the bill and asked us to leave for the next customer to come. paying 600 euros ‚Ä¶"
65,Momo, 1 star ,a month ago,"Left after 5 mins, very loud place with poor service"
66,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice atmosphere. The DJ played good music and the bar tender was attentitive. Food was great.
67,Momo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great food and atmosphere! Definitely for recommendationüòÉ
68,Momo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was absolutely flawless!

Music was simply too loud, during busy hours we found ourselves having to shout ‚Ä¶"
69,Momo, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Could not sit with 8 persons.
Drinks took more then 30 minutes."
70,Momo, 2 stars ,2 months ago,Music too loud & food drowned in sauces with flavours that are too strong
71,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing drinks and had some great bar snacks!
72,Momo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great Sushi, very nice place"
73,Momo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Cozy atmosphere and the food is good. But the TALL receptionist lady is rude and condescending telling us to order quickly. She did not mention the cut off time and this old waiter was rushing us and said ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you advise that the ‚Ä¶
74,Momo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible customer service and treatment
I really don't recommend. As a customer what you want in a restaurant is, a nice meal, nice time and the peace. That's not momo, especially for peace of mind. ‚Ä¶"
75,Momo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great cocktails and great food, often great combined as well.  It's pricey and it feels it - from the attention to detail in the cocktails to the attitude of the customers. ‚Ä¶"
76,Momo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My third time eating in this fantastic restaurant and all the time I had a great experience! Food is superb, ambience as well, staff very well trained and friendly! Yesterday it was my last time being there and my husband and I had a ‚Ä¶"
77,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam! Very big inside, good menu, good collected wine list and always fresh fish! Very friendly stuff! Reservation is strongly recommend! Just two things - no terrace outside and the toilet is in basement, after few beers could be difficult to return back to the table!"
78,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was amazing! The service though... we came in for a relaxed lunch, so no time pressure. I wasn't sure if the staff was tired from the day before or just not feeling it. But they weren't all that friendly. The food definitely compensated for it though! Would come back when I'm in town!"
79,Momo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place has amazing Asian fusion food with a gorgeous decor!  Drinks are unique and delectable and the staff is incredible! I go to Amsterdam every year for work and bringing friends, colleagues, and clients here every year is a must! ‚Ä¶"
80,Momo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Michelin start vibe. Exclusive atmosphere. Fine food & service. Excellent for a small group of friends or a couple. Recommended to come before dinner for a drink a the bar. Good selection of whisky, drinks and cocktails. Upfront reservation highly recommended."

82,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"For sure the best sushi of high quality in Amsterdam. All dishes are very different, tasty and unique. Uramaki are the best but sushi tacos and pad thai are very good as well. Also very beautiful the location as well.. so elegant and ‚Ä¶"
83,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food. Nice staff. Food on the pricier side but worth if to treat yourself. Nice modern decor as well. Highly recommend
84,Momo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"TL;DR: ok food. Awful service. We got to our table at 8 pm, after we were told we can stay there till 10 pm. So far everything is ok. But it took 25 min till the waiter took our order, and we got our last dish at 9:45. The same time the ‚Ä¶"
85,Momo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"For the price I was expecting much more. ‚Ç¨150 per person for drinks and dinner. The food and service was fine but it wasn't ‚Ç¨150 per person fine. The upholstery on our couch at the table was stained and burned. Since you can't smoke indoors for years, that burn was there for a very long time."
86,Momo, 3 stars ,a month ago,Average. Not worth the price tag.
87,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been there for a solo lunch. I really wanted some good sushi and it didn‚Äôt disappointed me at all. I am not an expert sushi reviewer but the toro nigiri was just the best I‚Äôve had. Soft, delicate but extremely tasteful at the same time!!! I really didn‚Äôt expected it an that why it was so great !!! 100% suggested."
88,Momo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food but high prices. The cooking wasn‚Äôt really surprising, for this money a bit more creativity and originality should be offered. First but no second visit. Don‚Äôt try to speak Dutch however...they won‚Äôt understand you."
89,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing Japanese restaurant, great location.  Booking advised.  The food was out of this world and the service excellent.  Quite expensive but well worth it for a treat from time to time.  Would highly recommend."
90,Momo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,I celebrated one of my birthdays there and i have gone for sushi a couple of times. I like the food. It is very tasty and the portions are just good. The cocktails are okish. It is a bit pricy.
91,Momo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is good, but for the price you pay the service is really bad. We asked for drinks 3 times and all 3 times they came wrong. When we asked for the manager he was so inpatient and rude."
92,Momo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Very disappointing!
The host suggested that we will arrive  earlier so we can start on the bar, we arrived and there was no place on the bar and on top of that our table wasn't ‚Ä¶"
93,Momo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love this place. Wonderful staff. Great drinks and very good atmosphere. Food options from nibbles to mains are so tasty. Good music and great seating options. Highly recommend a visit.
94,Momo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent food and some interesting flavor combination. Service is not great and your table is only available for 2 hours, and they let you know well in advance the clock is ticking, which makes the dining experience feel rushed."
95,Momo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Overrated, not confortable, small tables for two, too much noisy and very bad and loudy music.
Hot inside. ‚Ä¶"
96,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good service, especially for Dutch standards. Excellent food, nice atmosphere, music not too loud. Great cocktails!"
97,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere, delicious sushi and cocktails. The price is a bit up there but in my opinion it is justified by the quality of drinks and food."
98,Momo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Honestly worth the money, I had the duck and the Manjari chocolate dessert and both were cooked till perfection. Prices are quite expensive but since the food is really good and the staff and even the doorman were super friendly I think ‚Ä¶"

The service is sort of ok and adequate for Amsterdam standard but certainly not ‚Ä¶"
100,Momo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Solid Asian fusion‚Ä¶. But should Re-invent itself
101,Momo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The location of the place was great. The policy they created is another story. Even if you have a reservation and your not done with your food or drinks, they will prompt you to leave the table for other reservist to use. If the sitting ‚Ä¶"
102,Momo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Horrible Dinner. We stopped our dinner at the third dish and asked for the bill. The food was so boring without any special taste that you can make it at home better. It is so expensive and for what? ...
Furthermore, no one came to see us when we were disappointed."
103,Momo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, exclusive dishes and presentation and an amazing atmosphere. Make sure you get your reservations because it can get busy. Its also a bit pricey but its worth it. I had several foodgasms"
104,Momo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"It lost its charm. Used to be nice and posh. Now it feels old, outdated and dull. It has turned into a money machine - pricey small dishes without the glam it had 5+ years ago. Many other places to enjoy food and drinks, I don't recommend this anymore."
105,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My absolutely favourite restaurant in Amsterdam. Highly recommended. Best food, awesome sound, nice light, great people. Even the cooks look like models."
106,Momo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Wasn‚Äôt seated in the restaurant due to wearing black designer joggers and a plain black hoodie, which would be fine if they mentioned about their dress-code on the website, and didn‚Äôt let a person wearing full adidas tracksuit into the ‚Ä¶"
107,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was here with a large group of people who were staying in Durham over the early May Bank Holiday weekend and we were booked into The Cellar Door for a meal following Evensong in Durham Cathedral, on a pre-ordered three-course menu. The quality was first class, though there was a sense of wondering if and when the spuds would arrive."
108,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here for lunch with my boyfriend! Absolutely lovely. I ordered the Momo Bento and he ordered the Spicy Bento. We also ordered the soft shell crab roll on the side.I had a mango mocktail and that was nice too. Decent prices and lots of food. Would love to come back!
109,Momo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Probably one of the best fine dining restaurants in Amsterdam. Offering a rich Asian style menu with a huge variety of flavors and dishes you will for sure find a lot you can eat. ‚Ä¶
110,Momo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Hope that this is just a temporary slow down.
Used to love this place.
Lunch service was barrly ok. ‚Ä¶"
111,Momo, 1 star ,5 years ago,Had fond memories of the bentos in the lunch menu 5 years ago and had high expectations. Very disappointed in this place on the second visit. The crispy duck with hoisin sauce was so salty my mouth became wrinkly afterwards. None of the ‚Ä¶
112,Momo, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Sushi so good - we had to come back for more...
We had lunch at Momo and enjoyed their Bento. Don't miss the Momo Roll, it rivals some of the best sushi I ever ate. Big kudos to the bartender for mixing us fancy non-alcoholic drinks!"
113,Momo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Rude and very average food! Came here with some friends and due to alllergies I had to order my salad without the dressing. This was no issue, but another friend at my table ordered the same thing. When the first salad came out the waitress ‚Ä¶"
114,Momo, 1 star ,7 months ago,Pretty garbage service. The hostess is so rude and uninformative.. i dont recommend
115,Momo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best ambiances in amsterdam but compared to other cities not so cool! Food is ok but not great. I had it burned a couple of times there . Cocktails are great! They don‚Äôt take your coats to hang inside if u don‚Äôt have dinner there. What a bs!
116,Momo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Must say that the waitress and workers general were very kind and friendly and had a good response to our requests. But the food is average and plus too expensive for what we got. Very big minus is that it is not possible to take away.
117,Momo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food. Loved all of it. We are not sure why they have a policy of no left over containers to take along afterwards? Otherwise would have been 5 stars
118,Momo, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Nice for one time but not more than that.

The place looks nice and is actually the restaurant for Park Hotel. Though it ‚Ä¶"
119,Momo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,What a fun staff! Expensive but quality food and service.
120,Momo, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"It looks designy, hip, but the people visiting this place aren't. A lot of long faces with too much too expensive makeup on them. Uninspired but expensive outfits. There's security at the door which is strange for an Amsterdam restaurant. ‚Ä¶"
121,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, wonderful food, superb meal. Maybe the gorgeous modelesque girls on the front desk could be a bit more smiley, but apart from that pretty much  perfect."
122,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is an amazing culinary experience. Not a sushi place, but they have amazing sushi, it's combined with South American influences like ceviche and the like, making for a pretty stellar culinary experience."
123,Momo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Funky and vibrant atmosphere. Cool and beautiful people. However the food I think was a little disappointing given the presence of the place. Service could have better.
124,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food and service. I liked a lot MOMO rolls... Fish was super fresh and tasty. Sweet potato fries were perfect... Crispy outside and soft inside.
125,Momo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Was not very impressed with the venue. It is marketed by hotel concierge as being a trendy place for a night out.
I felt the mood was missing. ‚Ä¶"
126,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"MOMO is an upscale restaurant which I would recommend to anyone who wants to try Amsterdams best sushi. I am no fan of sushi, but there is no doubt I will go to MOMO for another run at it. ‚Ä¶"
127,Momo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place!! I Highly recomend this restaurant. For me they have the best match with food, drinks, service and atmosphere.
If you want perfect dinner with cool music, creating a vibe ambiance...this is ""the place"" in Amsterdam"
128,Momo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great food... A proper Fine Dine!
129,Momo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This food is there to offend nobody -- a 'thai' beef salad without any heat or fish sauce seems like a good example. It's an elegant room for people who care for that alone, and have money to waste showing it."
130,Momo, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Worst experience in a restaurant in Amsterdam! Before finishing dinner they brought the check to us because other costumers were waiting for the table. The hostess Nana, was very rude. She wanted the send our unfinished dishes to the lobby ‚Ä¶"
131,Momo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The expression ""Kings new clothes"" springs to mind. Yes the food is good, but everything is over priced (eg bottle of water 7 euros) and the waitress had a face like a slapped a*se. Tried it, won't be going back."
132,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"what a fantastic presentation of a variety of food, great service and nice background music not so overpowering that you can have good conversation.  Highly recommended! Five Star overall"
133,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful room. Very spacious, bedroom,and bath/shower room. Television upstairs and down. Very well kept,and lovely view of canal from very large window. 5‚≠ê"
134,Momo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Used to be one of the hottest place in Amsterdam but it is losing its glory. Still a trendy place but now you have many other better places found in Amsterdam. Food are okish but not super and definitely not live up for the price.
135,Momo, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Make sure you order one item at a time. Plates are meant to be shared and two of us ordered a crispy duck, lobster roll and a dessert + a bottle of pinot noir and it was less than 100 euros. I think this place was the best dinner so far ‚Ä¶"
136,Momo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited whilst on a short get away to Amsterdam.

Great location right next to the Rijsmuseum and park. ‚Ä¶"
137,Momo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Disappointed! Tricky stuff, trying to steal. What is the sense to share all dishes if portions are so small? Why I can‚Äôt order for myself?!
Quality of food is good."
138,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent dining experience for lunch. Staff are fun and friendly. The bento box was excellent with good portion sizes and a variety of food. Highly recommended for lunch!
139,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best restaurants I have ever tried. Efficient and friendly service. Marvelous food!!
140,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Such a fun spot with great music and really good food. Went with a large group and the service couldn‚Äôt have been better.
141,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Trendy lounge like restaurant with very high quality Japanese dishes ( 'Noma' level)  with a South American twist. Super friendly, caring staff."
142,Momo, 1 star ,8 months ago,Food was great. But the service very bad
143,Momo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Amsterdam for two weeks, by far my worst meal. Better off going to a top end restaurant like Mr. Porter to get better service and food quality. Left the restaurant feeling robbed."
144,Momo, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing tasty food! There was a twist in the sushi! Never ate sushi so good in my life... is a bit expensive...
145,Momo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is good, comes with a pricetag though. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed. Also like everywhere in Amsterdam be prepared for a lot of ambient noise you will have to speak up"
146,Momo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service .....excellent
Food.....huge portions and well worth the money
Drinks .....sensational ‚Ä¶"
147,Momo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food is excellent. Perfectly cooked meat and sushi is to die for. But their attempts to make themselves seem exclusive just come off as rude. Also absurdly expensive.
148,Momo, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Delicious food and Ok service. My only concern was that food was a bit cold. I think they need to improve serving times. Bit of an expensive edge but well worth it.
149,Momo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We went to this restaurant due to the good comments, but to sum it up in one word i would say TASTELESS. the food has no taste at all. Fish is not fresh. do not recommend this place st all, I love asian food and this was just a big dissapointment."
150,Momo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The best Sushi experience i've ever had. Simple location with a lot of very sofisticated dishes and a great an professional staff. Quality has a price though
151,Momo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Was advised to order far too much food resulting in an extortionate bill at the end.
‚Ç¨200 more than we should have paid if the waitress had listened to what we wanted."
152,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best sushi‚Äôs you can have! Expensive but worth the price.

Great location, good service and don‚Äôt forget to reserve in advance."
153,Momo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Perfectly located in the center of Amsterdam, if you are a fan of great design and delicious Japanese fusion delights, this is your spot.
Even though it is an expensive choice, it is 100% worth it!
Sushi, sashimi, ceviche... Exquisite and delicious!"
154,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Love the place. Great food. Excellent service and cool ambience. Good selection of cocktails and wine!
155,Momo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Sleek and trendy decor, head-pounding house music over unbearably salty dishes for a shockingly high price. I went in for Japanese and left with a stomach ache from a salt and soy overdose. I won't be back."
156,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and atmosphere, to bad glutenfree is still not able with many of the dishes and desserts. Prices are quite high for the food quality"
157,Momo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Love this restaurant. Very good atmosphere and excellent food. You are sure to have a great time here.
158,Momo, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"It's more a bar than a restaurant. Cool room, I'm too cool to care service, loud music and pretty people in pick up attire. So entertaining certainly but not a good restaurant."
159,Momo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very well presented, sashimi seemsed fresh, unfortunately too tourist-oriented+ overpriced to give authentic dining experience. I liked desserts thought!"
160,Momo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Had a lovely lunch, staff well trained and very polite. Prices are on the expensive side but at least you do get quality and well made food. Reminded me a bit of Zuma in London."
161,Momo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,That‚Äôs so hot X
162,Momo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A very trendy and expensive restaurant.
I like the food but don't like the two hours limit for eating.
Very busy and very noisy. ‚Ä¶"
163,Momo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This cozy, hotel-attached mini-restaurant is perfect for families and others that just want a quick, enjoyable meal. Highly recommended for breakfast, lunch or brunch."
164,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Music is so nice, food is great, service is perfect. Simply best food experience you'll ever have."
165,Momo, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Good food and great service. But feels like you take a step back to the 90's and like the place is part of the Night at the Roxbury-movie. Quite expensive also.
166,Momo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food was mediocre at best. The decor isn't interesting and service was just okay. Wouldn't recommend unless you are really out of options.
167,Momo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place was quite disappointing. Very average food quality, loads of ice in food and drinks for an above market price."
168,Momo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If you want Albert Heijn's sushi that has been marked up 10x this is your place. Poor service, horrible plating, and dry, old sushi."
169,Momo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Stylish and pricey place.  Nice bar area with great cocktails and fashionable crowd.  Popular with high heeled locals.
170,Momo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Really tasty food, though a bit on the expensive side. Service was good but reservations would be recommended on rush hour times"
171,Momo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Reasonable food, but way overpriced for what you get. Attempts to be fancy but comes off as unwelcoming and pretentious. Once but never again."
172,Momo, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Well, bar is good. Bit pricy but good. Service is nice too. But sushi is not. Overcooked sushi rice, not professionally made rolls and over priced."
173,Momo, 1 star ,4 years ago,Thanks MOMO for giving me one of the worst food poisoning experiences ever. I'm only in Amsterdam a few days and there are other things I would rather do than keep running to the toilet and shivering in my bed. Please check the quality of your tuna before serving it.
174,Momo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice Japanese fusion restaurant that put a spin on some traditional Japanese dishes. For example, miso marinated black cod or gindara misozuke is now grilled black cod with spicy miso sauce. The lunch bento was also delicious. For sake ‚Ä¶"
175,Momo, 1 star ,5 years ago,VERY RUDE STAFF! AWFUL EXPERIENCE! After 2 hours they tell me to get of the table because they wanna sell it again. Never i my live i heard that before. I have been in many restaurants all over the world. Wauw. Been in expensive restaurants but this one is not worth it. To high prices.
176,Momo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a Great place

192,Momo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good experience to be there and it is testy. However, for those prices I would like to eat more than some finger food."
193,Momo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent cocktails (depends which bar tender prepares them), good atmosphere, nice music, the food is overpriced for what you get, lately you need to be lucky to get a spot in the bar, overcrowded."
