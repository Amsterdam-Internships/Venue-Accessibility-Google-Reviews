0,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Quick and impressive service for a pub. Nice large TVs for watching various sports games. The narrow floor plan, and the large storefront windows which open wall-to-wall provide the atmosphere of a NYC pub.üëç"
1,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 2 stars ,10 months ago,The staff is plastic. The crowd is chalk full of amateurs and the food is meh! Name's the koolest thing about this joint. Covid 19 Petrie dish. Cross the street.
2,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Magpies is a great bar in the Park Ave neighborhood. On nice days, you can find the windows open and seats available outside, but it can get jammed very quickly. The bartenders are friendly and their bar food is good."
3,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Quality service and the bartender new her stuff. McKenzie was her name
4,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Small place appetizer menu only
5,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It was ok, is Rochester,  not much to expect in this town, was crowded for the size , drinks are affordable,  although some of my friends were not happy with the preparation of cocktails like the Sex on The Beach.  This is definitely one of the best places in Park Avenue."
6,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Small and busy place with just a small alley for outside space on Park Ave. Great location but just takes awhile to get a drink at peak times. Usually a good beer selection and at least has some TV's to kill the waiting time.
7,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderful food, beautiful bar, at a  reasonable price! One of the better spots in Rochester if you want bang for your buck!"
8,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Small, cozy bar on Park Avenue. Good beer selection but if it's busy, good luck trying to get a drink. When it gets very crowded it's impossible to be there.  They allow dogs inside."
9,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"There were dogs and puppies. The Draft beer I had was not the best, kinda tasted stale, also Yates was not there. Bummer. Service was good though."
10,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun pub, good atmosphere, friendly patrons, clean bathrooms, fast bartenders, darts in back, pretty good amount of seating for a smaller bar... And dog friendly!"
11,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 3 stars ,4 years ago,A little too small for groups. It feels like most patrons are the regulars. A good place for quick pint of beer but the food quality is not too good.
12,The Magpie bar & brasserie, 1 star ,a year ago,I bought a drink and then was told that if I don‚Äôt have a seat I have to leave. Why sell me the drink if you can‚Äôt provide me a seat. Hire a respectful staff
