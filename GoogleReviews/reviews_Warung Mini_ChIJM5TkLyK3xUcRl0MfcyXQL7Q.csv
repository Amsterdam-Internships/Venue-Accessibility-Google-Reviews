Good quality price. I recommend."
3,Warung Mini, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"I am a long-time fan of this place. Today, however, it changes. They asked for our corona bewijs, in which I do have, and my other friend have corona vaccinations certificate. We ate here all the time with such certificate, but ONLY TODAY ‚Ä¶"

7,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Went with a family member to takeout from this place, service was nice, took a while to get the food, they have very limited vegan options but you can grab a bite there if you pass by, and it is very tasty.. ‚Ä¶"
8,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very friendly staff and also good food
9,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This eating place serves Indonesian or Malay food. Portion is large. Fried rice served with chicken, lamb, beef or bread"
10,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Easy to find, quite small for amount of customers but very accommodating. Food is good with a good variety of Indonesian food. I enjoyed it."
11,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"The food at Warung Mini is very very good. I usually order Saoto soup or Nasi, which is always perfectly seasoned and not too spicy. Their pink coconut milk is also delicious. If you visit The Hague, make sure to stop by at Warung Mini. I'm pretty sure you'll have a unique experience."
12,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,5 months ago,the food was great but took a bit long for our order to be ready
13,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I‚Äôm almost reluctant to give a good review as am worried it will become overcrowded, but I‚Äôm convinced this is the BEST Surinamese in Holland. Food is amazing, prices are reasonable and service is friendly & professional. Nice, diverse ‚Ä¶"
14,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,a month ago,Tasty breads! We will dine in next time
15,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good value restaurant.
Service is ok.
Special cuisine of a mix of asian cuisine from Indian to Malaysian."
16,Warung Mini, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I didn't even know the country, let alone its cuisine! The food was tasty, but not something really exciting. The main disadvantage was that toilet was not clean, most probably because of the place was overcrowded. However, I think that it's a nice place to eat"
17,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The only place I've seen with ""proper"" portions around the hague. Our order was larger than we thought it would be and we could not finish what we started since everything comes is big portions. The food is various and delicious, they take ‚Ä¶"

20,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Since the ""big"" move from the ""small"" location it is very busy during peak eating hours. So lunch and dinner time it is packed. The quality of food has not changed, however the quantity has been reduced. The restrooms are clean and the ‚Ä¶"
21,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,3 years ago,First try...the shrimp sandwitch and Soto are both good.
22,Warung Mini, 3 stars ,10 months ago,"Good tasty Soto soup. Good for local market, Chicken satay is reasonable. Excellent bread chicken curry"
23,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Tempeh + bread, awesome combination. As a Javanese (Indonesian), i approve."
24,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, big portions and a nice atmosphere. Even though there's almost always a line til the front door, Warung Mini is worth the wait. ‚Ä¶"
25,Warung Mini, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Used to really like this place, still has an appeal because its always busy. Nevertheless, the last two times I ordered take away I was unimpressed with taste and quality of roti chicken and the bami chicken. Maybe better to eat inside!"
26,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great food and great seasoning. The only downside of this restaurant is the line in front of the building. Their pick up is inside. This means that the people having dinner are in the same room as the people waiting for their pick up. Super hectic. The service is a bit slow as well. Don't go here for a quick bite.
27,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Warung Mini Den Haag is one of my favourite restaurants in this city. The food is nice (I can recommend the lamb noodles/bami). I'm not familiarised with Indonesian or Surinamese food so I can't compare it to the ""authentic one"". The food is delicious and has a lot of taste. I can recommend it."
28,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I like the food! Last time I went was during covid lockdown. Queue outside, place order inside, take away the food. Service was good."
29,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there with four friends and ordered many different dishes and snacks. The food tasted and looked good and the prices were not too high. The restaurant itself is a bit small, but it  does not feel packed when seated in a full restaurant."
30,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Saoto is the best and the rest is also good
31,Warung Mini, 3 stars ,2 years ago,This joint seems to be quite popular with locals. Surinamese and Javanese food is the home specialty...The rice gado gado I tried was not bad and the tempeh on the side very spicy. Overall recommended for a filling and good dinner. Prices are also reasonable.
32,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I was walking along and stepped into this place & wow! It is the finest ever - good, tasty food & absolutely reasonable! Also with great quantity. For my stay of couple of weeks, this became my daily joint for dinner! The coconut milk shake ‚Ä¶"
33,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Warung Mini is a surinamese-javenese restaurant. They food there is great! There's a good price- quality balance, mainly because of the large portions. You can also order take aways. Because it is popular, do keep in mind that you'll wait a ‚Ä¶"
34,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best Saoto soup in NL üëå
35,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"If you love Surinaams food, this is the place to be!! They have the best roti's and sauto soup!! It's soo good every time I eat there. Sometimes I feel a bit lazy and I order it online too Tee-hee :) Really friendly staff and it's always busy! So make sure  to make reservations!!!"
36,Warung Mini, 1 star ,a year ago,Food horrible!!  Chicken in the saoto soup was old-tasting.  They use the cheapest of the cheapest ingredients ........ despicable!!  Never going back there ever again and would never recommend this over-priced place to my worst enemy
37,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food I always like to go back. Restaurant doesn't have many tables so you may have to wait.  Take away is also available and you can call in advance to order then pick up later
38,Warung Mini, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Crowded place. Sitting very close to other guests. Took a while for the food to arrive and food was tasting kind a blend. Only thing what made it better was the sauces and spices like sambal which you could use to eat your dishes.
39,Warung Mini, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Ordered bami chicken sambalgoreng and was surprised to find no trace of sambal. The meal and plate was piping hot when it was served and my guess is that it has been microwaved heated. That's not what I expected for a meal that costs 10.50 euros. Disappointed as I came with high hopes after reading the rave reviews
40,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good halal food
Soup is recommended, I will come again and again for this soup
Reasnable price to its location ‚Ä¶"
41,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love this restaurant. The food is always  yummy. The taste of the food is great. My fav dish is sauto soep (very refreshing) and petjel (healty and the peanut souce was perfect). You have to try it !
42,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Always (very) busy, because overall the food is fan-tasty. Friendly staff, happy to eat there again or recommend another person to go eat there, if they are in the area."
43,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"quite delicious food! - Only the fact that you only get (soft) drinks, canned or in plastic bottles, with plastic cups (and especially absolutly no alcoholic beverages) makes me giving no five stars... ‚Ä¶"
44,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, low prices,  friendly service. Esp the Indonesian-Surinamese dishes are fairly authentic. Veggies are crisp and fresh."
45,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice restaurant with delicious food. The staff is friendly. The restaurant can be quite full so that you have to wait in line but it is worth it!
46,Warung Mini, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great food! Would be 5 stars if the waiting time is reduced. Even after calling up front we still have to wait too long for our food

49,Warung Mini, 5 stars ,4 months ago,This is the best restaurant in the Hague.
