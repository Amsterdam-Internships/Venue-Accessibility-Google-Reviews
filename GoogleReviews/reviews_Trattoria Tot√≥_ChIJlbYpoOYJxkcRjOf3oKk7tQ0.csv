7,Trattoria Tot√≥, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty okay food. Servers nice, funny, that they keep talking Italian to us. My salad was big portion, fish enough, but the side was a joke, I need much more veggies to fill me."
8,Trattoria Tot√≥, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Really bad service, it was not the waitress's fault, it was the chef's fault, a group of friends of him came to the restaurant and they were having gyn and tonic after dinner while did not get even the starter. …"

24,Trattoria Tot√≥, 5 stars ,a year ago,We visit Amsterdam for the first time. Trattoria Toto was an amazing restaurant. Easy to get to and service was amazing. The food was fresh and tasted authentic. It’s a must visit if you find yourself in Amsterdam.
25,Trattoria Tot√≥, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stumbled upon this place by accident and it was so good! The service was friendly, the pizzas were great and the pastas were solid. everything felt freshly made and well dressed (nothing was drowning in sauce). Not super cheap but well worth it."
26,Trattoria Tot√≥, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Steak special was delicious with a truffle sauce.  House wine was not very good. The pasta dishes were pretty good. Carpaccio was fresh and beautifully presented. Staff was helpful and the restaurant was charming.
27,Trattoria Tot√≥, 4 stars ,a year ago,Delicious pasta and wine. Sympatic staff :) (maybe a little bit too salty to our taste). Would be nice to have grated parmegiano on the tables but maybe there wasn't because of the covid.

29,Trattoria Tot√≥, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Walked in for a delightful meal and were eagerly seated. Carpaccio, pasta, lobster, and wine were are very delightful, and the dishes were well prepared. Our server took great care of us, and made us feel welcome, even with a baby. Rustic italian atmosphere inside. Great meal."
30,Trattoria Tot√≥, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent Italian fare, and they really seem to take pride in their food. The taglioline pasta with lobster was fantastic, if not a little messy.
However, the waiting stuff are laconic and a little unwelcoming."

39,Trattoria Tot√≥, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We were able to walk right in on a Saturday night, no wait at all. The service was good, very friendly.  Wine list was reasonable. Their focus is Pugliese food, including a few choices with burrata and some polpette.  This is a very casual place near the museums, away from the craziness of an Amsterdam weekend."

42,Trattoria Tot√≥, 1 star ,3 years ago,Service was very rushed. Meat in spaghetti Bolognese was very poor quality. Lasagne served with no garnish or garlic bread. Poor quality all round and not good value for money
43,Trattoria Tot√≥, 1 star ,4 years ago,First time we had dinner at this restaurant we were quite disappointed about the pasta and the dessert so we left a review on IENS explaining what we did not like but also saying that we really appreciated the vitello tonnato. Today we went …

45,Trattoria Tot√≥, 1 star ,4 years ago,"A place with average food and execrable  service. We arrived at 6:30 and said we had an 8:00 curtain. Despite prodding, our main course never arrived until 7:40, allowing only time for a couple bites and paying the check, which also required prodding. Stay away."
