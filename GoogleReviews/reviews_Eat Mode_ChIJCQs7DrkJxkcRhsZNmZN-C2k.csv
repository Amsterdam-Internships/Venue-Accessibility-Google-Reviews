1,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was very good and the staff pretty nice. It‚Äôs a small but fine restaurant with asian dishes. I had the Beef Ramen, which was very good, I just didn‚Äôt like the seaweed, but that is personal preference."
2,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Coming from an Asian, the food is delicious. The pork neck were very tender. Handmade yakitori (chicken skewers) was so juicy. Friendly staff in a cosy place. I love the portion. Not so big so we get to try other food. Price is very ‚Ä¶"

We were quite in a hurry to catch our train and they were extremely helpful to recommend dishes which would be fast to make."
4,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the Fried rice with chicken, vietnamese lumpia and crackers with beef. Good quality and tasty. Prices good for a big city. Service fast and efficient. Was there for lunch."
5,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,6 months ago,A very pleasant surprise. You walk into a location that doesn't look too interesting but you get immediately plunged into some incredible japanese traditional food. Here i've eaten some of the best gyoza i've ever eaten in my life and i would surely come back if i came back to Amsterdam in my life.
6,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing experience! This places is barely recogniseable because of its size - but an absolute highlight! ‚Ä¶

9,Eat Mode, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I go here for beef seaweed udon and chicken salad with ginger dressing. Best combination for a good price.
10,Eat Mode, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for a quick meal. Not the best place for a long diner though. But the prices are really affordable, especially for the quality you'll get. Definitely recommend the ramen burger and Japanese style curry with chicken."
11,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Quality vs price was very good. The waiters were very kind and have a pictures menu so if it's your first time in this kind of restaurants is very illustrative. The food was very tasty!
12,Eat Mode, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good place to dine. if you like chinese.Its not at all hot which is kind of expected in holland but you can add the hot chilly and soya sauce to make it a bit indian taste. Chiken noodles are recommended.
13,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service (ask for Thomas) and even better food. The restaurant is very modern and beautifully decorated. The staff helped us pick food which didn't trigger my husband's food intolerance. We had the daily-changing Bento box üç±, and some egg fried rice with Chicken. Our favourite restaurant in Amsterdam!"
14,Eat Mode, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Basic Asian fare from nowhere in particular. They absolutely pump out meals so be ready to eat soon after ordering it‚Äôs not a long lazy dinner kinda place. Would eat more mode

16,Eat Mode, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Sushi was ok but the toilet was gross, like fungus gross. They offer gloves, but I'd rather see they'd just clean out there. :( Very non-Japanese.

29,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"With all fairness, this happens to be my favorite restaurant in Amsterdam. Prices might seem high at first, but the dishes are stuffing and the portions are really big. And, what matters most, the food is truelly delicious! ‚Ä¶"

41,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious! We visited 3 years ago and enjoyed a ramen burger, curry soup and some interesting juice mixes, and today the ramen burger was better than ever - medium-rare! The sides are great portion sizes too, the shop is cosy and the service fantastic and fast."
42,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We come here every now and then with friends and tourists for the delicious and relative cheap food, great atmosphere and friendly staff! The location right next to Nieuwmarkt and the red-lights makes it ideal for a quick meal while discovering Amsterdam."
43,Eat Mode, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"House-made sauces and amazingly tender meat. The steamed duck dumplings are amazing. You can get better ramen (Tokyo Ramen Iki), but for Asian Fusion at this price tier, it's one of the best in the city."
44,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very nice and cozy place
45,Eat Mode, 1 star ,5 years ago,This Restaurant was the worst one i have visited during my week in Amsterdam. All three meals we ordered were disgusting. The salmon with rice was terrible but worse was the Japanese style chicken with potatoes. Don't go there it will ruin your evening!

48,Eat Mode, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice restaurant. Not so cheap but also not costly. The food tastes great. Its more of a Chinese kind of restaurant and not Indian or other countries. Specially the noodles are cooked very well.
49,Eat Mode, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really Lovely Experience. The food was delicious and the service was great.
One downside, it is unfortunately one of the restaurants in town if you ask for tap water, they say they do not serve it. Which I personally find a bit preposterous but still doesn't take away from the great quality of food."
