3,George Marina, 5 stars ,9 months ago,SO HAPPY WE CAME HERE! Great place to eat! Food was amazing! Some colleagues of mine made a reservation and confirmed it with no issues. Even called to make sure food could be ready when we arrived - and it was! Highly recommended! Waiter and waitress both were available for anything extra we asked for - 10/10!!!

6,George Marina, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very good food, goor portions, very kind service, but it took very long while waiting for the food. Ordering beer, water, was difficult, we had to ask two or three times, and once it never came.
It was night, so we could not enjoy the river view."

8,George Marina, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"On the evening we joined, there was an over 30 people group eating at one long table. This resulted in a very loud ambiance unfortunately. Very tasty food, contemporary design and trendy crowd. Prices expensive, as one can expects in a place Liles this. Attentive service."
9,George Marina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere, cheerful and good service, tasty food. I had the roasted root vegetables as the entr√©e and the salmon dish with miso sauce as the main course. Both were sophisticatedly prepared. Infact I felt like I was at a French ‚Ä¶"
10,George Marina, 5 stars ,10 months ago,What an amazing restaurant with an amazing view. We have enjoyed our fantastic meal (champagne and lobster salad). Thank you for your great service.
11,George Marina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"What a shame, really good food and location but just as you can read on other reviews, the service is TERRIBLE. It took 20 min to get our food and they brought one of the things twice, they wanted to charge us more than what it was."
12,George Marina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful place with great views of the amstel. Great food and very good service
13,George Marina, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Food was ok, outside terrace is quite sad looking although location is great, poor poor service! Restaurant that tries to pretend it is high end but instead of trying to add secondary bells and whistles like taxi service, valet parking etc they should cut the pretentiousness and start with the basics, decent service being one!"

19,George Marina, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Amazing food, definitely recommend eating here. however, the service was the worst I have ever experienced. They were so rude, they spoke to us as if we were ""below"" them. Absolutely the WORST service ever."
20,George Marina, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The actual food was good for me and 2 friends, we enjoyed it a lot. However service was a bit of a mess with things gotten wrong and taking long. There was a large group celebrating something however so that may have thrown them off a bit. Can still recommend it, location at the water is real nice."
21,George Marina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful place with great views of the amstel. Great food and very good service
22,George Marina, 1 star ,a year ago,"Biggest overhype in Amsterdam, never been served bad service like this. Food is extremely minimal for the price, trust me I‚Äôm fine with paying good amounts of money for food. Never been served as bad food and service in my life as this ‚Ä¶"

29,George Marina, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Sweet potato fries and Ceviche were so good!! Definitely coming back for lunch again :)
30,George Marina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Great view and that's where it ends.  Poor service, foods takes over an hour to receive, kitchen closes with out warning and the food is not worth the price.  I've tried this place 3 times now because of the location and easy access to bringing a boat, but I will not return.  There are so many better places in Amsterdam!"
31,George Marina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was really great but don't come here to be served fast or for the friendliest smiles at busy times (thursday evenings for instance), or at least make reservations. ‚Ä¶"

33,George Marina, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Feeling as if you are in the South of France, everything fishy is mouth-watering. Blackened tuna is to die for but so is the eggplant ..."

36,George Marina, 1 star ,3 years ago,The location and the restaurant itself are very nice and exclusive. Also the food and the drinks they served are tasty and good however... the service is really bad and I fully agree with the last two reviews with reference to the staff. ‚Ä¶
37,George Marina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful location, nice view over the Amstel. We were invited to a private evening. The room and the music were very nice, the food was OK, very nice fish, steak not as good, service so so...some of the guests got their dishes very very late, after everybody finished eating. Not so nice..."
38,George Marina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Diner beware! On the surface looks nice, however, the devil is in the detail. Staff, young, inexperienced, enthusiastic but inexperienced.served sushi with thinbal size dish for soy sauce for 10 pax. Sushi, easy to see it's not done with ‚Ä¶"

41,George Marina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They are the rudest, least customer friendly place I've visited in the last 15 years in Amsterdam. Actually, they were quite shocking. We showed up at a bit past noon the place was empty. A server asked if we had reservations, which we did ‚Ä¶"

44,George Marina, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great spot in Amsterdam, beautiful views over amstel river, close to center, very nicely styled interior (with fire place ;). Great choice on the menu, from very fancy to a great burger, i loved the sushi / ceviche / seafood, my friends ‚Ä¶"
45,George Marina, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Arrived on a Monday evening. The place wasn't very busy. The food was amazing, I'd recommend the miso cod. Service was good with friendly staff and there was a nice beer on tap too."
46,George Marina, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"So here's the thing. This is one of the best locations and atmospheres in Amsterdam on a sunny evening. It doesn't get better. However, it's also some of the worst service and value for money in terms of food and drink. I just don't get it. ‚Ä¶"
47,George Marina, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible drinks and service . Almost everything we ordered  came out incorrect.  One person in our party waited 15 minutes for their food after everyone else had been served.
48,George Marina, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great looking place but service wasn't great and that's the least I would expect when I'm going to pay 23 euros for a piece of Octopus that was prepared well but a bit off balance in seasoning and did not include ANY side dishes. ‚Ä¶
49,George Marina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Impressive location definitely deserving a star, for the rest, food is mediocre, atmosphere is rather pretentious and service is absolutely TERRIBLE. A real disappointment for such an appealing location and for having put so much effort in the architecture and interior design."
50,George Marina, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The location is great, overlooking the Amstel river. The snacks really fall very short for the price. The butter and the olives come in their original package, so basically they don't do anything."
51,George Marina, 1 star ,2 years ago,Staff utterly disinterested (rather continue their own conversations) and had no eye over the dining space to see if customers needed service despite a quiet evening. Very poor for Amsterdam; one to miss.
52,George Marina, 1 star ,2 years ago,Great location. The food and service is just plain bad. If you‚Äôre gonna spend more then usual on food find another high priced restaurant.
53,George Marina, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great location, great food and great service."
54,George Marina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Great location, much potential to realize

Nice terrasse, but for food I rather go to the new Italian vis a vis. They try ‚Ä¶"
55,George Marina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible service. 1 waitress and 1 waiter just walked by and completely ignored me. I was confused at first. Maybe I have to go inside to order and even when I stood at the bar, I had to wait. So I went to my seat and the waitress with a lame excuse and took my order."
56,George Marina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ok-level food but very expensive beer and drink (one bottle 750ml water costs 6 euros). Btw it‚Äôs a very racist place. As an Asian looking person, NONE of the staff help would like to respond my request, just ignored me. They are also not friendly at all. If you don‚Äôt speak Dutch or look Dutch, Don‚Äôt go."
57,George Marina, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love the interior design of this place, the sushi is amazing too, definitely recommended.
Protip: Check out the toilets to warm up"

61,George Marina, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great Food and good service. Just the size of the dishes could be bigger for the price.
62,George Marina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A modern place at river's side. You can eat fish or beef. The place inside is very nice decorated and there is a lot of space with nice view to the River
63,George Marina, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The service leaves much to be desired. Waiters are snobbish. Food is good and the location nice. Won't be going back though.
64,George Marina, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice hangout place in front of water. Very nice view. Valet parking is in basement and little costly. Easily reachable from Spaklerweg metro station.
65,George Marina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere, open fire... Delicious food and wine. Amstel station is just a short walk."
66,George Marina, 1 star ,3 years ago,No drinks menu. One of the worst customer service ever. Waited 35 minutes for a coffee. Waitors are rude and unefficient.
67,George Marina, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good in all repects, but a bit pricey for the level of cuisine offered, when compared to the current Amsterdam restaurant market and competitor's offerings."
68,George Marina, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place next to the water. With the small harbour in front. Gives a lot of activity and buzz
