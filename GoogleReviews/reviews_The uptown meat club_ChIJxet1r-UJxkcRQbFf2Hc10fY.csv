5,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We were met with a friendly and incredibly accommodating member of the team at our entrance. My brother is on a strict keto diet and sometimes it's not easy to get a meal for him just right. These guys blew us away, absolutely no problem ‚Ä¶"
6,The uptown meat club, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"It took more than 1 hour for them to serve the meat, which was pretty mediocre at best. Nothing other than the ambiance and dessert was high quality.

10,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,We found this place on our way to the museums and it was a pleasant surprise. The picanha was perfectly cooked: tender and with great flavor
11,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Meat selection is great and very fresh and tasty we ordered our meat medium rare and it was prepared accordingly. Wine card is more than decent for a pub type of place but they didn't have appropriate glasses for red wine. Staff is nice and helpful and prices are a bit more than average but still ok for the area.
12,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good sized servings, great value for money.
Had a vegetarian burger option also.
Meat was slightly overcooked.(per their description), which didn't bother me ‚Ä¶"

14,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. Great cuts of meat and fresh. Try the Philly Cheese steak. Love the spin on it that they have and how you actually are asked what temp you want your steak at....not like some places where it's all just well done and dry. A must try if you are in Beautiful Amsterdam.
15,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good meat, good wine selection (Spanish and Chilean ...) And good local cheese (and yes I'm French ...). I was not expecting this nice surprise. I could not get a table So i ate at the bar. Very nice service by the friendly personnel (and the boss and his gf). Excellent address. Not cheap ... But great  quality! üëç"

18,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A very trendy place that serves very good quality meat. Anything from steak to veal are cooked exactly as ordered. Their cocktails are definitely under-rated. The White Russian I ordered came with a shot of espresso, and that combination ‚Ä¶"
19,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hands down the best food we had in Amsterdam. Even a simple grilled vegetable dish was flavorful. We had the Caesar salad, steak sandwich with grilled vegetables and mushrooms on the side. Everything was delicious. Service was excellent as well!"

40,The uptown meat club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We waited for half an hour to get the order and another half an hour for the food. The food isn‚Äôt even good after that much time of the wait, let alone the small portion that can only feed birds. ‚Ä¶"
41,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food. Ribeye just melted in my mouth - impossible not to eat everything, including the fat.
But the best is the staff. They are all very attentative and the young lady host ‚Ä¶"

45,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Was a great evening at this place. We had a tomahawk and it was amazing. Stayed for a weekend in a hotel close to the restaurant. That‚Äôs why I came 2 times in 3 days :) I liked it a lot...
46,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been to this place several times and every time - the food, the service and everything else surrounding me has been amazing. I've tried the steaks and the burger there and I can say that I haven't tried better ones in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
47,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Steak was perfect. Professional and welcoming staff. Rate it 10/10.
48,The uptown meat club, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Expensive for what you get and not the best meat I've eaten.. Due to allergies I asked for another side salad but that wasn't possible so I had to order it another one and pay extra. Not the best customer service if you ask me.
49,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,8 months ago,The T-bone steak was cooked as ordered. Very tasty . You need 2 or 3 people to eat the whole thing.
50,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"That was my luckiest hit ever: great vibe, popular but not touristy, food was great quality and the staff were super friendly!!! I'm so visiting again!.thank you guys!"
51,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice food, decent wine. We especially liked the chocolate chip cookie baked in a tiny cast iron skillet with vanilla ice cream. It was even OK for our 6 year-old, though it has an upscale feel. I felt the price was fine relative to what you get."
52,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The spareribs were amazing! I thought I didn't like spareribs, turns out I never had any good ones. And these were very good!"

56,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Atmosphere food and service were all great. We were actually trying to go to The Seafood Bar next door but there was too long a wait. Glad we were able to get into Uptown. The downstairs looks like  a great place to host a party. The only ‚Ä¶
57,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Ordered the Tenderloin / Ossenhaas [250gr] medium rare for takeaway with chimchurri and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked. Oven heating is also possible, just do it at 160degrees for around 7-8 minutes!"
58,The uptown meat club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Tourist trap. Overpriced, cold food and poor service.

Steak came out cold as did the asparagus, sent then both back and the other side ‚Ä¶"
59,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious! Beautiful steaks, big portions and very tasty sides. The spring chicken was not over cooked and full of flavor. Amazing wine pairings too. Not overpriced considering it‚Äôs right by the museums!"
60,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went to this when we were struggling to find other options around.  Not a whole lot of options in the menu overall, but they definitely knew how to prepare their food as it was good.  I had the chicken, which was really small, but it was cooked very nicely and good spice flavoring.  Neat interior design, and glad I've visited it."
61,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,a year ago,Always great! My favorite UBER eats in Amsterdam. Really good steaks. And I love their steak tartare. Caesar salad is good too! I can‚Äôt eat gluten so there‚Äôs a limited number of places I can eat and this is my favorite.
62,The uptown meat club, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice promising looking place and staff... but the burger ... Average ... nothing special, the meat was over spiced and not medium as I‚Äôd request, just well cooked all through, very salted and lacked the fresh juicy vibe I‚Äôd expect for this price and location... but it was ok... and maybe if you eat in it would be different ."
63,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good meat, enjoyed our lunch. Great burgers. Only negative - steak while very good, the portions were small so check size before you order and service was just ok... (Forgot my beer)."
64,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff was warm and engaging while the food was terrific! The beef was cooked to perfection and aged beautiful--melted in my mouth--while the bernaise sauce heightened the experience. When I travel, I rarely go back to the same ‚Ä¶"
65,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN AMSTERDAM! Never tasted a meat like this in such a lovely cozy and warm environment. I am so glad I walked by with my girlfriend and decided to stop, attracted by the warm welcoming attitude of the staff and ‚Ä¶"
66,The uptown meat club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place but I won't be back.

Here's the good part: ‚Ä¶"
67,The uptown meat club, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Probably the worse meat I've ever been served. Tasteless ribs and so was the steak. Very chewy and extremely fatty! Highly disappointed.
The staff were okay but didn't offer a discount when I told them about are food, ‚Ä¶"
68,The uptown meat club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good cut of meat, nice interiors... Way too expensive and pretentious for what it was. We were served with a lot of flair for some slightly fancy pub food. My ""sandwich"" was a mediocre salad on top of a piece of toasted bread. An open-faced salad on a bread pedestal. Meh. Touristy area, so over-priced for nothing special."
69,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Yummy food on Uber Eats! Good 2 for one deals on burgers and the bavette with potatoes is delicious too! The cute note written on the side of the bag for repeat customers is very nice, thanks for the good service and quick delivery during covid-19 restaurant lockdown!"
70,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing food ‚Äì we shared all the specials, plus some sides, amongst three people. Porterhouse was absolutely impressive, but the Tomahawk and everything else was great, too. Make sure to ask for daily/weekly specials! One small criticism: ‚Ä¶"
71,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fairly expensive for the amount of food. However the meat is excellent, and their burgers are absolutely fantastic. Service was nothing exceptional but the venue is very nicely organized and spacious. Will definitely come again, and is a good pit stop for any meat lover !"
72,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very happy with our meal. We chose the three course special which was excellent value - your choice of two selections from each of the starter, main and dessert menus. The wine was also very nice. A good place for anyone staying in the museum quarter of Amsterdam."
73,The uptown meat club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"All of burger's we ordered have Been not teasty, prepared  as well done but we ordered IT as medium done or raw. The quality od meet is questionable.  French fries burned, the same roasted potato.. look for something else, we do not recommended this place."
74,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"five Star for this Place in my opinion are not enough. in front of the park the most important Park in Amsterdam, there is this Nice restaurant very delicious  with Good people. In fact the owner of this place is a couple of Young guys. I like the loft the meat and my friends loveed the hamburger"
75,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice and quiet place. A large choice of different meats obviously but you can also take a vegan burger or a tuna steak, for instance. I didn't try but the wine menu looks nice. Then, the cr√®me brul√©e was great. Finally, you will deserve a walk in the neighbouroods of the Vomdelpark üòâ"
76,The uptown meat club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Over all it's great but it's quite pricy fir a burger place. The special burger + draft beer was 12.50‚Ç¨, which is fair but it only came with one simply burger without anything else. Maybe I had too high expectation. Don't get me wrong, he ‚Ä¶"
77,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very good meat, nice seating and atmosphere accompanied by live music on this rainy Friday eve. Was a perfect little escapism in this rather peculiar period. Highly recommended!üëåüèº"
78,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I enjoyed the service, the recommendation. We tried Picanha 600gr. Easily served 3 people and the mix of sweet potatoes with asparagus, butter was super good.
Beers also nice."
79,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely meat, nice staff (they showed me around the kitchen). Nice atmosphere as well. I love to eat a good steak and this one was definitely a 9 out of 10."
80,The uptown meat club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent burgers, deceitful lunch deal. Appreciating the margin perspective, the bacon and cheese cost ‚Ç¨1 on top of, and fries as well. I had a bavette there once that was like rubber and I still remember so avoid that, despite the name of the place"
81,The uptown meat club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I went here with a group of friends and some of us ordered mixed grill skewer dish which you were supposed to get beef, chicken and sausages. and we got only 1 smallish skewer in a big wooden board which made the board look so empty. For ‚Ä¶"

84,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We ordered from Thuisbezorgd. The food was super delicious and as they had no spareribs, they upgraded us to the c√¥te de b≈ìuf instead, without extra costs! Great service, I will definitely order again."
85,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is very nice, and it‚Äôs for a fair price. We didn‚Äôt have to wait too long before we got the food either. It took a while before we got the drinks because the waiter forgot it, but it was an honest mistake, so I give them 5/5 stars."
86,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Super quality meat and good prices
87,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,5 years ago,My girlfriend says the food was decent but I think we both have been spoiled by the steak places in London so I personally found the fries were the highlight of the meal the steak was only ok (I didn't think it was seared properly) for the price it charges you would expect a slightly higher standard. Service was good though
88,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Coming from my South Africa I can genuinely say that my meat was delicious.
The service was gracious, I loved the atmosphere and would recommend the restaurant wholeheartedly. ‚Ä¶"
89,The uptown meat club, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I was eating with a Chinese friend of mine and it was pretty cold there. The ambience was very sterile anyway. Service was ok but not great, wine was not poured in glasses, some of the menu was not available for the last few days. Would not come again"
90,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best hamburgers my wife and I have had. Food was excellent. Service was excellent. Good location and good prices. Can't recommend highly enough.
91,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best meat in Amsterdam! Excellent service, wines and ambiance at a fair price.  Lunch and dinner restaurant with a Parisien atmosphere and Argentinian meat quality"
92,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Rushed in,without a reservation, from the pouring rain.  Nice welcome and we were quickly found two seats at the window bar looking out at the street.  Very quick service which was brilliant as we had a concert in an hour to go to.  Menu ‚Ä¶"

95,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good cozy place near the Vondelpark to have a good meaty dinner with a good atmosphere
96,The uptown meat club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Maybe I'm crazy? But tap water should be free. It's insane that they can't just give me water or of their faucets. Then the burgers were just mediocre at best. Poor service as well. 2 girls next to us waited 20 minutes for anyone to take their order.
97,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"great place, we enjoyed it a lot - the food, the delicios meet, the wine.
stuff was friendly and even sent us a cheese platter on the house!

101,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best meat in town! The bavette is juicy and cooked to perfection. Good portion for side orders. It's a bit on the expensive side but money well spent
102,The uptown meat club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Nice little place and friendly staff but it's infested with small flies. I only went for a couple of beers and sat outside but when I went to the bar there were swarms of them. The bar staff said they were dealing with them but no way I would eat there.
103,The uptown meat club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Steak was absolutely amazing and the staff was friendly. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for quality food combined with a great atmosphere.
104,The uptown meat club, 2 stars ,5 years ago,More for tourists who show up only once. Is ok if u want just get a drink during your shopping but dont count on a quick service. Staff are nice but majority inexperienced. Location is central but noting special.
105,The uptown meat club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We went for dinner. The meat and chips were perfect, the wine too. The service was not so good. Probably this is why the place wasn‚Äôt full."

107,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Steaks were very good, cooked just right.  ""Salad"" on the side left something to be desired.  Service was prompt."

111,The uptown meat club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Service was good but the food was meh. I never tried their famous steak but I couldn't bring myself to with the dark cow wallpaper staring at me..
112,The uptown meat club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly (Italian) staff en quick service. Good capuchino
113,The uptown meat club, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I planned to invite my friend there.  He is using a wheelchair, and there is no table suited for him..  all the tables on the main level are bar high, and to get to ""normal"" table will be impossible for him, as there are 3 big steps to climb..  too bad :("
