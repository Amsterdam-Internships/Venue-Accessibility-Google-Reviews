7,Garlic Queen, 3 stars ,a year ago,"2.75 Stars: I rarely say this, but I really wish they leaned into their gimmick more. For a themed restaurant, Queen‚Äôs lack of commitment to its gimmick makes it feel sad and underwhelming. ‚Ä¶"

17,Garlic Queen, 1 star ,3 years ago,The service was awful. We were snubbed right as we walked in and asked if we had a reservation when there were ten tables still open. There was so much tension between staff and the head and only chef. We arrived at a little past 8pm and ‚Ä¶
