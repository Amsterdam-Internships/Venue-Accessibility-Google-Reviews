0,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Fast! Very tasty! Best fastfood noodles in this area. I recommend you to taste egg noodles with sweet-sour sous. I eat it right now and feel pleasure!
1,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Randomly found this place while we were walking in Amsterdam!
the food was good and it was a lot! I couldn't finish it. I really recommend this place!
Good taste good foodü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
2,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is pretty awesome for a quick hot noodle dish. You can put things together how you like and most of the combinations are under 10 Eur. It is quick even though it‚Äôs super busy, but unfortunately it‚Äôs super tiny. So better take the wok to walk #nojoke"
3,Wok to walk, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,The food was good but 2 boxes for ‚Ç¨31 euro??? Nah.
4,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great tasting noodles. One portion is actually enough to share. The meat amount is very good for portion like that. Nice to choose base and sauce. Must go for a cheap ish meal.
5,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little spot for lunch or dinner. You can infinitely customise your meal, but cautious because the price adds up quickly. There's a little seating in here, but don't count on it, it's mostly a take away joint."
6,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Ordered multiple times and have never been disappointed! Definitely recommend
7,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing.very good for price and being able to customise it so it's not loaded with rice or noodles is great. Also seems good for vegetarians but I would double the sauces and stuff when you arrive. But really fast service and nice atmosphere. tends to get crowded quick because it's not very big.
8,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food as usual, the service was good. the cashier was very funny and nice. I only rate it 4 stars because the place is very small and you can't really sit there with your friends"
9,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best wok restaurant in Amsterdam. Everytime I am amazed with the quality and the taste of the wok. üëåüèæ
10,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A small place in itself but really nice food. Not all joints are worth visiting though.
11,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,There is nothing better then WoktoWalk..i love it.. eggnoodles with teriyaki sauce ohh my goood.. u never go wrong with this..
12,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Noodles and rice are very nice. They are made on authentic wok. Different sauces you can choose. There is a lot of meat out in the dish. Vegetables are very fresh. Also the thing I like most is that you can always count calories in the wok ‚Ä¶
13,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I came here for a quick dinner and ordered egg Noodles with Teriyaki sauce. They were alright but a little bland overall. Great portion size. The price was very good at only ‚Ç¨4.95. Very busy store but staff keep the orders going through fast.
14,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you miss a good chinese food then you must come here to grab their noodle~
The best and big portions"
15,Wok to walk, 3 stars ,3 months ago,A bit overpriced. The good quality has deteriorated over the years.
16,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty food at a good price. The portions are huge, probably enough for two people to share. Everything is totally customizable. First you choose your base, there are several types of noodles to choose from. Then you can add toppings ‚Ä¶"
17,Wok to walk, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Massive portions. Felt the ratio were not great.
18,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were looking for a quick meal in La Ramblas and found Wok to Walk. Had a rice, veg, bacon and crumbed chicken stir fry with teriyaki sauce. Wow it was amazing. Portion size was more that enough. My son shared with me. Veg was fresh. Service was great. And it was well priced, about ‚Ç¨7. Will certainly recommend this place."
19,Wok to walk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Super average Asian food. The ingredients were good- you have to pick the rice or noodles and then the various curries and meat. Then one person will mix it all up. For a fast food place it‚Äôs ok... but for an Asian place... could be better
20,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Quick and easy! Food was good. Would definately recommend ü•°
21,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A guy walking back to his hotel told me a couple of years ago this place was great, so after a movie last night, I decided to drop in. You pick all the ingredients (I got rice, chicken, pork, cashews, and Teriyaki sauce) and they stir fry ‚Ä¶"
22,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You can create your own ‚Äûwok to walk‚Äú for a good price. It was very tasty.
Funnily enough that the best music we heard during our visit was in this take away...
Absolutely recommend it."
23,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is really really good. Choose whatever ingredients you want. Though the price is a bit steep. With a few ingredients like chicken broccoli and cashews, you have to pay ‚Ç¨13 Euros which is about $17 dollars"
24,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Quick, tasty and decently priced"
25,Wok to walk, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Definitely quick takeaway but the taste wasn't the best. I ordered something with curry sauce but I didn't taste curry at all. If you're hungry right now it's good place. If you want to enjoy food choose something else
26,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best Asian food I have ever had. Seriously. The portions are generous, the food hot and delicious. The only downside is that the place is small and the entranceway a little tight. I cannot say enough good things about the food."
27,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good & cheap choice for healthy food in the area, been going there for years for the occasional lunch. They tend to lather on too much of the sauce you pick forming a puddle at the bottom of the box, so I usually just order with no sauce and add soy sauce & spices."
28,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good enough place for a quick wok. You can select the sauce and toppings. Overall the taste is quite good. However its slightly costly as per the quantity. Enough to fill one person for 10 euros.
29,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It is a nice location, as the name already says, wok to ""walk"". It is not really big to sit inside and rest while enjoying your dinner. But the food is great and fresh, really well prepared and not too expensive!"
30,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The staff is always very kind in any of the location.

The food is delicious and for a very cheap price! I‚Äôd eat it every day"
31,Wok to walk, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I've ordered noodles with chicken breast, pineapples, onion (I even pointed on it) and garlic and I've received noodles with only pineapples and garlic. Really? You think it is a good dish for a dinner?! Also I've ordered it with a ""Sweet & ‚Ä¶"
32,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is really good, I should say addictive. The staff is nice and careful, they are really friendly. You really have to try it!
I will not put five stars only because one portion of food is too much for only ‚Ä¶"
33,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,a year ago,For 8.5 euros you get a noodle and a drink if you get the daily combo. The noodles taste really good.
34,Wok to walk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I had chicken teriyaki and my partner had chicken with prawns and he had a very bad stomach however I did not. Good value for money... just avoid the prawns.
35,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic fast food noodles.  Pretty much an icon of Amsterdam with one situated on most busy streets and tucked away in alley ways.  This isn't gourmet food by far although a fantastic quick and fun snack.
36,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place with great food at reasonable prices. I come here just to see the wok aunties work sometimes. Not quite 5 stars because getting the egg noodles sometimes means also getting eggshells...
37,Wok to walk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"On a recent visit to Amsterdam, called in for a take-away. Took the food back to the hotel, which was a stones throw away. My wifes wasn't too bad, but mine was nearly cold. After eating 1 piece of chicken I decided was not safe to eat. ‚Ä¶"
38,Wok to walk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Guy preparing my food insulted me and my girlfriend for no apparent reason. Went back on himself after we called him out saying it was ""just a joke"". This establishment can be summed up nicely by those words. Just a joke."
39,Wok to walk, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food for takeaway and prepared as per the customers choice. Good attendants in a crowded day, who serves you quickly. Enjoyable toppings and sauce options with Noodles and Rice."
40,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this place. You choose your noodles/rice, meats &/or veg, sauce and toppings. All come in a nice American style box. Very filling. Very fast service."
41,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Almost always a great place to get a more healthy quick meal. Pick your base (noodles, rice, or veggies), pick your add ons (meat, soy, nuts and herbs), and choose a sauce (mild to spicy). It's more a factory production line than a restaurant, but you can at least sit in the back to eat your meal out of the box."
42,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cheap, fast, fun. Excellent vegan options."
43,Wok to walk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I am usually a big fan of Wok To Walk but I was very disappointed with this branch. The noodles were too soggy and cut in pieces when stir frying. It didn't look like noodles anymore but pieces of noodles. The sauce was tasteless, like ‚Ä¶"
44,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the greatest places if you are into noodles. Lots of options from veggies to the sea food. Cheap prices for almost a kilo of noodles with various toppings! üòã
45,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is like heaven to me. It is my first visit to europe (UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands), and it is quite hard to find foods that satisfy my asian tongue. When I tried the food, It really reactivate my taste bud after two weeks ‚Ä¶"
46,Wok to walk, 1 star ,4 years ago,Such a pitty that I was interrupting the cashier and another worker while ordering my standard meal. Normally go to another shop and thought i'm near this location so let me eat here. Sadly the cashier only looked at me from the corner of ‚Ä¶
47,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great food (vegan options) staff were polite and the food is cooked Infront of you. Took about five mins for each dish to be cooked. Worth the wait.
48,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Always a good food option !
49,Wok to walk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I did a take away. Not as much flavour as you‚Äôd expect from a yellow curry noodle. ‚Ä¶
50,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the Wok to Walk chain found across Amsterdam.  Fast food cooked to order, as good as you are going to get from such an outlet. You cannot go wrong with food from here really"
51,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Life saver in late night. Saut√©ed in front of you depending on the sides you choose. Besides, I was offered free toppings like deep fired crispy onions which I forgot to oder initially"
52,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best place to eat in Amsterdam, wish they would bring one to Manchester. Everything is cooked fresh in Front of you and tastes sooooooooo good, can't get enough of it x"
53,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It is a pleasure to walk the wok ;)
54,Wok to walk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Interesting way to serve fast asain noodles, the cost can be surprisingly expensive cause it's based how many items are chosen for the mix. Cost for a meat or 2, a cost for mushrooms, peppers, onions, etc, etc."
55,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is great and I fail to understand the problem with the 'spicey food' I am very sensitive when it comes to spicey food and personally haven't had a problem with that here. Apart from the food bare in mind this is a very small restaurant, so if its busy be ready for a take away."
56,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is great and the staff are friendly. It's quite a cozy place. There are places to sit, but there's very limited seating"
57,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"As good then a restaurant but accessible, lovely"
58,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty great wok. Extremely customizable, quick service, tasty food at a very affordable price! A classic in Amsterdam."

73,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Simple, fast, good and even healthy if you take the veggies. It is a bit cramped though and it can be quite busy."
74,Wok to walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Little space inside, two people having trouble walking by without touching each other, so it gets personal. It's pretty busy, expect to wait 7 or so minutes."

77,Wok to walk, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Choose your noodles/rice, choose your frozen meat, choose your frozen veggies, choose a 'sauce' and viola!, a meal in 2 minutes. Usually busy with tourists."

91,Wok to walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I bet there is something 'addictive' in the sauce of this joint :-) Asian origin fast food with an european spin.
