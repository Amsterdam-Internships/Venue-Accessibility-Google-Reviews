Good quality, consistency and taste of the noodles, spicy shoyuramen broth was very tasty, but the pork on the ramen was not good. I will go back to try the ‚Ä¶"
1,Hinata, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly staff and good service. In my opinion, ramen is not in the highest level. It's good but not for 5 stars. They are quite busy, in a nice place and sometimes people wait outside to get a seat. They don't take reservations via phone.
Matcha tiramisu was quite nice. Good place to have dinner."
2,Hinata, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice service very friendly people, I really enjoyed shoyu ramen here. The fried chicken was so juicy and flavourful ‚ô•Ô∏è Only thing is that the broth was a bit too salty, but definetely one of the good place to get yummy ramen."
3,Hinata, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Really good ramen, both vegan and normal. I also recommend the gyozas and octopus balls, really enjoyed them. The prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and you get your food quickly. A place worth a visit"
4,Hinata, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Cool place to have Ramen. It seems the place is always crowded. The gyoza was really nice. The portion was perfect. But somehow it‚Äôs missing something. I had miso ramen and my husband had soyu ramen. I tried his ramen and I think I‚Äôd prefer ‚Ä¶

Cons: ‚Ä¶"
6,Hinata, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"A small, somewhat hidden restaurant with friendly service and nice decor.

The food tasted fantastic, the portions were generous and all at a fair price! ‚Ä¶"
7,Hinata, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"First timer at Hinata, ordered the today‚Äôs special; ginger shoyu ramen. it was perfect! the broth was light, warm from the ginger. pork was flavourful, easy to chew. pro tip; would ask for hotter broth, especially in the winter. ‚Ä¶"
8,Hinata, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Nah this place wasn‚Äôt good as expected. Had to wait for a long time outside. Staff was nice and service was quick but these ramen are just average, especially the noodles don‚Äôt taste fresh and soft - they were more on the chewy side what kinda ruined the whole experience. Nice place but wouldn‚Äôt come again."
9,Hinata, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Excellent ramen, once of the best I've had. Their strong suit is the broth and the noodles - could improve the meet and tofu pieces in the broth though. Still, 5 star."
10,Hinata, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"It's a lovely ramen restaurant in the heart of Amsterdam. I've been many times and we are always enjoying every meal. You will find some great ramen dishes, also very nice vegan ramen, and some rice dishes. It s hard to decide. And the staff is always friendly! In the photo it is a rice dish with chicken!"
11,Hinata, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great Japanese Fried Chicken and the Italian waitress was super friendly. Wanted to come back for the Ramen but didn‚Äôt manage in the end
12,Hinata, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We started with an Aburi Chashu, which was very crispy and tasty. Then we went for a Shoyu and Kabashoyu Ramen. Both were tasty and well served. They left us with that cosy feeling, which is something a good Ramen always does. After some ‚Ä¶"

15,Hinata, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"Bad service, and food is not tasty.
We ordered 2 different kinds of ramen, and got the food 30-40 minutes after ordering, because the table beside us got our food instead of us. We even had to ‚Ä¶"
16,Hinata, 5 stars ,a month ago,"My favorite Ramen place in Amsterdam, really worth the wait! The atmosphere is also welcoming, and I strongly advise to take an appetizer and the mochis."
17,Hinata, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very big portions and many choices... Loved the place and the ramen üçú
18,Hinata, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"We ordered different things and they were all very good, so no specific recommendations, everything is good. However the staff were not the friendliest wich made us a bit uncomfortable when asking for things. The service was fast though."
19,Hinata, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Delicious food. I had the tofu starter and the spicy miso ramen. It was so flavourful. It‚Äôs a great spot, relaxed vibe and the staff are really friendly."
20,Hinata, 5 stars ,a month ago,"One of the best ramen I‚Äôve tried. Definitely recommended. I had the spicy veg ramen <3
+staff is really nice"
21,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So glad to discover this ramen spot in Jordaan.  It‚Äôs a very cozy spot and offers surprisingly great delicious ramens and other dishes.  Would like to try the vegetable ramen next time as they looked really good. Server was so kind to suggest an added dish of fresh vegi to go with my karashouyu ramen.
22,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Chanced upon this restaurant whilst looking to have lunch whilst wandering the streets in Amsterdam. We were blown away by the quality of the food. This is definitely the best ramen in Amsterdam and the tempura vegetables are also very hard ‚Ä¶
23,Hinata, 5 stars ,5 months ago,One of the better Japanese places I've experienced outside of Asia. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food.
24,Hinata, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Visited Hinuta Ramen &Bar by chance on Saturday,16 Nov  @5:20pm as I was strolling down the streets in Amsterdam city and it was getting dark. Excited with the aroma of oriental flavour once i stepped into the restaurant,  I decided to have ‚Ä¶"
25,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Another great, great ramen/Japanese place in Amsterdam...very delicious! Location is perfect, specially if in a sunny day you can seat outside. People are super kind and the owner/cook Japanese couple are simply very nice people! Definitely a good authentic place to eat some proper Japanese food.
Well done!"
26,Hinata, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This is not a bad ramen, but relative to Amsterdam's high standard, it's a bit average. Gy≈çza and kara-aga starters were decent, and the ramens were OK. The place itself seems very hipster, attracting some pretentious clientele. It still manages to feel quite intimate, and the service was good."
27,Hinata, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great ramen, also the side dishes are worth it. Good gyoza, takoyaki, fried chicken, etc. Too bad it‚Äôs only chicken broth for the ramen, would definitely like to see more variation (pork, beef, etc). Vegetarian options are available for the ramen."
28,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always a favourite! One of the best ramens I've had in my life!
Great quick service & friendly staff. Really amazing!"
29,Hinata, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best ramen I‚Äôve had in Europe
30,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great vibes, Great Ramen, what more can you wish for? Karamiso ramen is definately my favourite ramen. Their chicken and veggie Gyoza are also very tasty!"
31,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Friendly staff and cute interior. Food is ok and at good price
32,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Overall verdict: Highly recommended if you are looking for a good bowl of shoyu ramen! ‚Ä¶
33,Hinata, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very very good tasty ramen.
The staff were a little confusing when talking about allergies but they have a allergy menu which cleared things up."
34,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was excellent, I had the spicy veggie ramen (could even have been a little bit more spicy for me). My friends brought me here and it‚Äôs the perfect place to spend a nice and easy evening. They also have a large choice of sak√© and other typical Japanese beverage, but haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to try. üçú"
35,Hinata, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Real tasty. The texture of the noodle is great! The broth has well balanced taste
36,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good place with nice atmosphere and good quality ramen. Fast and kind service. Many choices for ramen and starters.
37,Hinata, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly service and atmosphere. The chicken Gyozas are delicious with soya sauce and a hint of chilli oil. The special pork broth Ramen was nice but lacked depth and it is a thin broth with much soya sauce flavour. However, the pork slices are very tasty."
38,Hinata, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best Ramen everüëçüëçüëç
39,Hinata, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Appetizers are good, but the ramen did not have enough salt and lacked the full flavor punch."
40,Hinata, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent ramen, not too salty like many others. It was missing a few more toppings though in my opinion and I‚Äôd also like to point out the enormously long waiting times. We got the menu after 30 minutes of waiting and our food after another 30 minutes of waiting."
41,Hinata, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Very poor service, food was ‚Äòokay‚Äô and they don't really verify your QR code.  They ask you if you have it, but during the whole dinner they did not scan the code of those who entered the restaurant, including mine."
42,Hinata, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great ramen, great service. Small, chilled restaurant with beautiful decor. Would highly recommend!"
43,Hinata, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very traditional, homely flavor. Ramen portion on the small side. Standout selection of Japanese alcohol like shochu, whisky."
44,Hinata, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good service, cozy small-place atmosphere and delicious above-the-usual ramen (miso on chicken broth) and amazing Kara-age. Ramen of the day was a pork broth ramen with ginger, which was also very tempting. Price are surprisingly reasonable for such delicious quality food! üçú"
45,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had veg Gyozas and the veg spicy soy ramen and I loved it. The service is amazing and the staff recommendations are great. Would definitely come back for some more ramen..
46,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Always a good ramen. Go for miso if you prefer thick and creamy üçú Lovely staff and a nice neighborhood to walk around.
47,Hinata, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"There‚Äôre lots of ramen places in AMS, this one definitely comes on top of the list"
48,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This ramen is sooo good, especially considering that they have vegan options! I never thought I‚Äôd have good ramen again, so they definitely made my day!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
49,Hinata, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best places in Amsterdam for your ramen-needs. Certainly the best in the Jordaan area. We had lovely ramen and some fried chicken as a side. Were a bit disappointed by the small cup of tea at a price where you would normally expect a pot of tea. Complementary water made up for it though. Very friendly staff!
50,Hinata, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Some of the best veggie gyoza I‚Äôve ever had. Great food, service, and atmosphere. Highly recommend."
51,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and cozy place with good vibe. Servers were very nice and he food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends.
52,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice decor and the staff is friendly. It can get busy but service is quick. The food was great and authentic. Would definitely come again.
53,Hinata, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing ramen place, takeaway perfectly packed and ready to enjoy at home."
54,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Bloody marvellous ramen. I‚Äôve visited Japan quite regularly over the past 10 years and this is amongst the best ramen I‚Äôve ever had. The space is relaxed and authentically Japanese, expect no clich√©s of waving cats and the like. This is ‚Ä¶"
55,Hinata, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"In overal good ramen, I had the spicy
Miso ramen, I love this kind of ramen and I like the egg. Prices are not too bad. One of the ramen places I will come back too!"
56,Hinata, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Sorry but we waited an hour for our ramen tonight though the staff is friendly but the ramen noodle itself is nothing really special and they serve the ramen which is not the order that we made
57,Hinata, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Clear broth ramen with ginger and pork was delicious! A lot of various whiskies, sake and beers. Very nice ramen place with friendly staff"
58,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"2 things I can recommend when having a cold or snotting about:
1. Spicy food - clears the nostrils right up!üå∂
2. Soupy food - nice and hot, heats you right up from the insideüî• ‚Ä¶"
59,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best ramen in Amsterdam i have ever taste. Loved takoyaki as well
60,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic chicken karaage. Soryu ramen was pretty good, though sadly no tonkotsu, my preferred ramen. Nice staff, fast service, and fairly reasonably priced"
61,Hinata, 4 stars ,a year ago,Really delicious broth both pork and veggie unfortunately chicken was sold out but i am guessing that‚Äôs a good thing!
62,Hinata, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Absolutely great service, I totally recommend the place. They took care of my puppy by supplying water and some loving attention. I was craving for dumplings for over a week and the steamed gyoza did not disappoint, ordered three portions."
63,Hinata, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Greeeeat Ramen! Good portions and deep flavors, everything you want for a great meal"
64,Hinata, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Contrary to what they‚Äôre popular for - ramen, we had a selection of starters that were very nice. But a little unauthentic in terms of vibe."
65,Hinata, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious traditional Japanese street food. Lovely place. Very cute toilets and clean ! Very nice and efficient staff.
66,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I always go for spicy miso ramen and this one was the best I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam so far. I‚Äôve been to Japan and the broth was just as rich and deep this time as when I was over there. Service was also excellent. Totally recommended!
67,Hinata, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"The food is good and definitely above average from what else you get in Amsterdam!
Unfortunately it happened now for the second time that we needed to wait very long for our take-out (i.e. an hour) They were apparently understaffed."
68,Hinata, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Fantastic food and service for a reasonable price.
69,Hinata, 2 stars ,4 years ago,To be honest I didn't get the taste whether it's good or bad. This is the fast time to eat Ramen in Europe even though I live in Amsterdam. I got too much used to eating Ramen in Japan. Real Ramen you know.....that is why I was really hesitate to eat Ramen here. Sorry for all of you who never had real Ramen.
70,Hinata, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This is sooooo good. Love the spicy chicken ramen. Also price is super good! Like to come here. Good drinks as well. Untill next time :)
71,Hinata, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great atmosphere and very good quality ramen. No reservations possible.
72,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty ramen, friendly service, cosy place. Recommended, particularly when it is cold and rainy in Amsterdam!"
73,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best ramen I got in Amsterdam ! this one was really delicious and exactly like the one you could find in Japan.
The cool vibes of the restaurant are also a big plus."
74,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôm very picky about a good ramen place and Hinata lived up to the hype and love for Ramen. A must try in Amsterdam, if you‚Äôre in the area!"
75,Hinata, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The waiters were nice :)
The Shoyu vegetarian ramen was good. The Miso ramens not so much. The takoyaki also left much to be desired."
76,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ramen, nice vegan/ vegetarian selection and friendly staff."
77,Hinata, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Disappointed! After ordering a Spicy veg miso which wasn't spicy at all, we received our ramen 45 min after ordering it and 5 min before the closing of the terrace, so they kicked us out because that's the law.... It was my third time coming here but I'm afraid I won't be back üëãüò¢ Sayonara Hinata."
78,Hinata, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Charming small japanese restaurant with Ramen and other dishes that remind of Izakaya bars.
79,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Awesome place to visit if you love Japanese cuisine.
80,Hinata, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Tastes as good as it looks. But shhhh, it was still easy to get a table and quick service."
81,Hinata, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Average Ramen. Chicken broth is not the way go go with Ramen. Karaage were nice, overall solid Ramen restaurant, clean with nice staff. But the most important thing lacks: The taste."
82,Hinata, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The food is really good. I was so full afterwards. The waiters were nice as well. The only negativ thing is that the Toilette is extremely tiny.
83,Hinata, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Honestly the food is nothing special, the portions are tiny and the flavor just isn't there. The staff is very friendly, but not attentive, we never had a chance to order more than one drink to share. The seating is very nice but paying 6‚Ç¨ for 2 bitterballen (curry coquette) is crazy and I was still hungry after my ramen."
84,Hinata, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Some really lovely staff here. But expensive but nice ramen and fun cocktails.
85,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent service and the ramen is one of the best I had in Amsterdam.
86,Hinata, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Best ramen i‚Äôve ever had
87,Hinata, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best ramen I've had. Very good vegan options, good price."
88,Hinata, 4 stars ,a year ago,The ramen is really lovely and a great taste. Only thing is that I ordered some extra noodles which see said was an exception for this time only. Would be nice to be able and order some extra noodles at all times :)
89,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great ramen with an excellent selection of Japanese whiskeys and friendly staff.
90,Hinata, 1 star ,a year ago,"We had a very negative experience here. They were clearly understaffed, which created a very hectic and unprofessional environment (doors slamming, waiters running and arguing with each other). We had finished our appetizers before the ‚Ä¶"
91,Hinata, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We have been visiting Hinata since they opened... they even used to go by another name. We love this place! They don‚Äôt only have ramen, they have some other nice Japanese appetizers and drinks! We love the spicy ramen here specially. Usually the staff is extremely friendly and everything absolutely oishii lekker delicious!!!"
92,Hinata, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered the Kara shoyu ramen. Texture of the noodle is quite good but not amazing. It's supposed to be home made, but it doesn't quite have them springiness and chew that I've had with other homemade ramen. ‚Ä¶"
93,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I find myself coming back to the delicious and reasonably priced Japanese food and drinks. I would describe the ambiance of the restaurant as laid-back and friendly. The orange cat that ocasionally stops by adds to this as well. If you're in the area, it's definitely worth to pay them a visit!"
94,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Me and my best friend were visiting Noordermarkt yesterday and found Hinata by chance. It's been a great surprise! The ramen was so good, also they have a good range of choices, with 8 different ramens, 4 vegetarian and 4 meaty, and other ‚Ä¶"

98,Hinata, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Hinata Amsterdam, is a very, very good ramen place if you‚Äôre looking for a very natural, smooth version. They offer loads of veggie and vegan options as well. Overall, Hinata makes their ramen extremely fresh. Besides, the staff is very ‚Ä¶"
99,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Another delicious ramen spot in Amsterdam‚Äôs canal belt. ‚ÄúAnother‚Äù but one of the best and worth seeking out specifically. Highly recommended for those who love traditional ramen, served in a laid back environment with friendly staff and an enthusiastic clientele all present for the same thing‚Äîbeautifully prepared soul food."
100,Hinata, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Cozy space, friendly stuff, delicious food, fair prices."
101,Hinata, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Really tasty ramen, however, it's not exceptional in terms of overall experience. The atmosphere is a bit cold, service is simply ok, and the starters are rather expensive for what you get. Definitely a good place to visit if you are in the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here if I'm not close."
102,Hinata, 3 stars ,a year ago,Ramen was pretty mediocre. Noodles were pretty tasteless and thick. The soup was a bit watery and the meat dry and not well marinaded.
103,Hinata, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"They need to improve the miso soup since that is the soul of the ramen, spicy but without taste. Cashu was good, the ratio  soup/noodles was not right and some ingredients could be better presented. Ambience and service were great."
104,Hinata, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Lovely food as usual, service was odd and snappy."
105,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super tasty and filling! Great service! Will definitely be going back!
106,Hinata, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Decent ramen joint, was fully booked at lunch on Saturday. we were lucky to get a seat after some serious kerfuffle. The main waitress needs a vibe check, stressed people makes for a stressed vibe. Try HINATA's new sister restaurant HIKAGE! Issa vibe."
107,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is the second ramen place I have been to since I moved here. I really appreciated the fact that we called and they said they would keep the kitchen open just a bit longer so that we can eat. I had the miso vegetable ramen with the ‚Ä¶

Place is super cute and friendly staff <3"
118,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best ramen in Amsterdam. Don't assume you can get a table though, it's often quite busy. The kazomiso ramen is great, and the Japanese whisky selection (and at least one Japanese gin) is also super interesting."
119,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Highly recommended. Don't think you can find a better bowl of ramen for this price in Amsterdam! The broth was brilliant. Unlike other broths from elsewhere, this chicken broth manages to strike a balance between richness and remaining ‚Ä¶"
120,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,SO GOOD. I‚Äôve been to a lot of ramen places in Amsterdam (not all though) and this is hands-down the best I‚Äôve had. It‚Äôs also the closest to the real-deal ramen I ate while in Japan. The broth is flavourful without relying on loads of added ‚Ä¶

129,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I wish i could describe with words how delicious it was !!! Lifetime experience! I can highly recommend for everyone who loves delicious RaMeN NoOdLe soup! They also have  wide range variety of Nikka whisky & Sake and few beers! Friendly staff nice vibes good food! Hmmm i think i will go again tonight!
130,Hinata, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Vegetarian spicy miso ramen, not too much toppings, not really spicy, but portion was quite big, taste wasn't bad. There are few vegetarian starters, croquettes and gyoza were nice. üëç"
131,Hinata, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Compact and lovely ramen shop. A very selected menu but you should get what you need. Dense soup with noodles of right amount of chewiness. Super friendly staff!
132,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely loved the service the food and the atmosphere. 10/10 would do again.
(coming from Vancouver often eating real Japanese cuisine I do have to comment no one there was Asian,  but honestly really exceptional nonetheless)"
133,Hinata, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Went to Yama Ramen last weekend during the 'soft opening' days (official opening is tonight!) ‚Ä¶
134,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Omg there's finally killer ramen in Amsterdam. The other places in the city are ok, but THIS is the standard I was looking for. You can get spicy miso and it's super high quality, ultra fresh, and their whiskey menu offers some incredible pairing choices too. 100% drop any plans you have and go here tonight!"
135,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Ramen and very cozy atmosphere!
136,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The karamiso ramen is a pretty fantastic bowl: al dente noodles, perfectly cooked chashu and egg and a broth that's deeply flavorful and needs none of the condiments on the table."
137,Hinata, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Service in English only, dirty menus, staff lets you wait outside in subzero temperatures with no customers in sight. Ramen was ok if overpriced"
138,Hinata, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really really good ramens :)

The staff is very nice, they have a large Japanese whisky selection. The place is a bit noisy ~"

140,Hinata, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Maybe I took the wrong Ramen, but I've had better Ramen in Amsterdam for the same amount of money. I was also missing Ramen with pork based broth, a must have for every Ramen shack. ‚Ä¶"
141,Hinata, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best ramen in Amsterdam. Fast and friendly service, lovely decor, and the ramen itself tastes absolutely amazing. They have a very extensive Japanese whiskey selection as well."
142,Hinata, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Overall meh. There was not enough ramen for everyone on a Sunday night at 7 pm. The alternative was chicken nuggets with rice, spinach and mayonaise."
143,Hinata, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Best ramen in town! Outstanding and friendly service.
144,Hinata, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Super good ramen for a fair price. Recomended place!
145,Hinata, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is ok. The noodles are good but slightly overcooked. The service is friendly but so incompetent, it is impossible to give more than 2 stars. They screwed up just about every part of the meal and looked surprised when we asked them to give us what we ordered."
146,Hinata, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"normal ramen, not very authentic but deco is good"
