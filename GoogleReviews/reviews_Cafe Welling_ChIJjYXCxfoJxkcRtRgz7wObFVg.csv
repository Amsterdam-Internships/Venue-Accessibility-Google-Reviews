0,Cafe Welling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved this little place tucked into a cute little corner street. The ambiance was amazing and we tried the best beef and pork sausages here. The owner is very friendly and warm and for that reason we spent a lot of time there chatting and enjoying the beer. Would highly recommend it to everyone.
1,Cafe Welling, 5 stars ,a year ago,This is the real deal! One of the last true cafes of Amsterdam! Where they served drinks and munchies and where it used to be allowed to smoke inside and the walls became brown!
2,Cafe Welling, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"A nice cafe around the museums neighborhood with a warm classic atmosphere. Be careful, some international credit cards are not taken."
3,Cafe Welling, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The atmosphere! Loved it, filled with local folk. The homemade ‘jenever’ is a must-try (but take the next day off, it’ll ruin you)."
4,Cafe Welling, 5 stars ,a week ago,This place is like a small gem hidden in a corner...loved it!!

6,Cafe Welling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous authentic Dutch locals bar. Great beers, nice atmosphere, excellent service, good value and a lovely little cat who tolerated a lot of fuss. No idea what his name is though."

9,Cafe Welling, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fabulous bar for a really authentic experience of Amsterdam. I could imagine friends meeting here in the war to toast each other’s health and plot revolt - or at least a smashing jazz riff. Very friendly lady behind the bar, and very nice welcoming patrons. Recommended!"

13,Cafe Welling, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We needed a place to get off or feet from walking all day in Amsterdam. This place was very cozy and the staff was very friendly. You have to go to the bar to order your drinks. The food selection is small, so don't come looking for a meal. They do however offer a small selection of appetizers."
14,Cafe Welling, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderfully characterful bar full of intriguing locals where everyone knows everyone. The selection of beers is decent with 5 taps. It’s the perfect spot to take a pew after a stroll around the nearby ZuiderMRKT on a Saturday afternoon. The landlady is glorious.
