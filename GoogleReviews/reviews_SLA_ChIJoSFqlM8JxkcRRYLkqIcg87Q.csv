10,SLA, 1 star ,6 months ago,"They take too many online orders which  they cannot handle (even though they are fast in making). Then you end up waiting min 30 min for a takeaway salad, while you are the first in line in person (at least you think so) . Totally absurd."

19,SLA, 1 star ,10 months ago,You know when you go into a place and part of the menu you can compose your own dish. So then there is some parts of the menu some of the options you don’t like… So you skip those but then if you ask for something to replace the skipped …

33,SLA, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Great concept but the food is not very good. Everything (including soup) is served cold (or lukewarm). Going around 11 made me wonder if everything was just left over from the day before. Cold rice in a bowl wasn't my idea of a good lunch. The girl working was very friendly and the space is super clean and chic.

51,SLA, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good vegan and vegetarian restaurant, near Winkel 43. At first we went there because Winkel was crowded, but the food was really good and tasty. It's also very cheap compared to other vegan and vegetarian restaurants. You can have a dish for about 10 euros."
