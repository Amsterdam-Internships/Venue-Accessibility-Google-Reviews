0,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice and cozy place. Ribs and pull pork are nice. Not so sure about chicken wings. Side dishes like beans and corn are great. The corn bread is awesome. If you group is big make sure to choose the family menu, basic is good enough"
1,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I'm quite surprised with all the rage about good ribs. I think they are arguably pretty bad, dry and with very little meat on them. Brisket was better, yet far from tender or juicy. Pulled pork was ok. Prices are too high for the quality you get. On the good side service was nice."
2,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"I thought the food was fantastic! A lot of great southern dishes. Cornbread, coleslaw, baked beans, ribs, brisket...so good. Can't wait for the chicken and waffles! If you like southern American BBQ, you've found the closest thing to being …"
3,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good quality meat, vegetables and desserts but all a bit over priced. Therefore 3 stars instead of 4."
4,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best Bbq joint in NL, very nice staff (best i've had in amsterdam) and owner even gave me a small tour in his kitchen.
Love the atmosphere and the food!!"
5,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 1 star ,6 years ago,"I liked the interior somewhat; that's what attracted us to this place. After ordering we got food worth 80 euros for three people. It could probably feed 1,5. Besides that the meat was cold and drained in sauce there was no nice flavor what …"
6,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great food, great atmosphere.
Positive
+ Live and radio music. …"
7,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,5 years ago,You don't find barbeque this good often. Don't waste your time on Rib joints in the city. Go here - every piece of meat brings a different flavor. The sides are all delicious (baked beans especially) and the staff is friendly and attentive. Passion goes into making this food and it shows.
8,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty good ribs, from a real smoker. Not the greatest, but definitely some of the best I've had in Europe. Some good beers as well. Friendly service, good atmosphere. A good joint. I would come back."
9,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing atmosphere, appropriate music, genuine staff, good smokey ribs, nice side dishes and relatively cheap. I do however recommend ordering less food than you think youll eat, portions are large (doggybags are common)."
10,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I dont know why this place had only a 3.7 so went to check the reviews and have to say ive been many times and have never had those experiences at gracelands myself. The service is good, not super fast but not way to slow either. Perfect …"
11,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fab place to eat. Great place for cavemen and their cavewomen. Staff are really friendly.
12,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Pretty crappy experience, its expensive for what you get. And what you get is just not what you want. The spareribs are raw(they smoked it for 8 hours is what they said), the chicken was tasteless, the pieces of meat were very dry and …"
13,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Lekker eten. Nice 'American bitsro' style BBQ place.  Food is good & portions are good.  A little bit on the expensive side but not overpriced by Amsterdam standards. 3 course dinner was about €38
14,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The atmosphere is great and the food is pretty good, but the service is terrible.  We didn't get half our order even after reminding them several times.  We finally asked them to forget it and just take it off the bill.  We also had to get our own plates and silverware and bus our own table."
15,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Another winner in the Sin City of Europe, Amsterdam! Fancy yourself an ole red neck looking for a place to put your hoe down or just out on the town looking for a great place to eat something left of centre in Amsterdam? Then Graceland B-BQ …"
16,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Very small portions, I had ribs but they were very dry and almost meatless. An overpriced restaurant for the quality and quantity you get. Staff is friendly."
17,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Awesome, rough, macho roadhouse honky-tonk kind of a typical authentic American grill and smokehouse restaurant. Often they have great bands playing. Brisket, smokey ribs, smoked fish and pulled pork are amazing! Truly mouthwatering! Slow …"
18,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I go here sometimes with an American friend of mine - he was mesmerised the first time by how much the place could have been any place in the US and felt like home. …
19,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Great bbq meals, nice beers and friendly staff.
The ambiance and looks of the place are great.
Kitchen can be extremely slow tho and the portions disappointingly​ small."
20,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really a great place to hangout and have some nice beer , good whiskey or food. The place is,so I have been told, just like in Texas. They also serve a great deal of vegetarian food."
21,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious! Authentic southern barbeque and a solid offering of traditional and creative side items. Moderately more expensive and smaller portions though compared to the U.S.
22,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the few places in Amsterdam where BBQ is done properly. Make sure to try the exotic desserts such as the Fat Elvis cake (Peanut butter, banana and bacon!)"
23,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place with friendly stuff. They did everything thwy could so we had a great time. Thank you guys. We will come back, has an real  American BBQ style & taste."
24,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 2 stars ,7 years ago,I enjoyed a lot the rockabilly atmosphere but unfortunately the food is not at the same level. It can reach 4 stars for drinking a couple of rounds with friends but I can't give more stars for having a dinner.
25,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"How can i have overlooked this place for so long? Excellent food. Atmosphere is great (sunday night live music). Staff makes this place,  super service! Will be back soon."
26,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great bbq meats.  Unpretentious - Untainted. Just get the xxxl graceland bbq, take the fat-elvis pie, and ask for a pickleback shot as digestivo. Your belly will be happy."
27,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Too good to be true: two veggies joined a carnivore pack and ended up eating their fantastic fill at a barbecue joint. Will be back w more veggie buddies!
28,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good food, nice beer and friendly staff. One complaint: The live band was so loud it was unable to talk to the person sitting next to you."
29,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 1 star ,6 years ago,Small portions for to much money. We ordered a meal for 2 persons. It was just enough for 1 person. …
30,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great ribs, with lots of sauce. Sides can be a bit hit-n-miss, but let's face it, you're there for the meat."
31,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Yummy Texan-styled BBQ dishes with generous amounts of meat, plenty of veggie sides and an authentic atmosphere."
32,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 3 stars ,4 years ago,American style restaurant. Food is nice enough though the ribs are not barbecued which was a bit disappointing
33,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This is a place where you feel that the people working here are doing so with love and passion for what they do. That makes this a great atmosphere to be in, filled with very nice staff and great food!"

37,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Pretty disappointed with the place, very generic food full of sauces rather than a more raw eating experience."
38,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The Brisket and their BBQ sauce are delicious. Also try their lime pie.
39,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really good Yank food, excellent service and great all round atmosphere."

55,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"(Translated by Google) The rave reviews about the spare ribs amaze me somewhat. Admittedly, the entourage of an American bar is very successful and the service is also pleasant. However, I found the side dishes and especially the sauces …"

57,Graceland Bar-B-Q, 1 star ,4 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Very bad food, the spare ribs were way too dry like trying to take a bite out of a towel. The taste was actually even worse. The burger was also served on a soggy Italian bun with a lukewarm burger where the …"
