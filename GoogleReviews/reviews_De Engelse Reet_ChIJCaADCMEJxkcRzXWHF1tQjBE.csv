0,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Quaint pub, highly recommended!  Very cosy and great selection of (draught) beers. The prices are acceptable, the service very attentive and hospitable."
1,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Original brown cafe with peeling decor unchanged since the old times. A bar without a bar. Bottles served from a back room. So much atmosphere in here.
2,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great little tucked-away place for some really good beer. Has the authentic smell of a real pub from the good old days. The staff is friends and the drinks are affordable. There is not too much space to move around inside, so be mindful about that."
3,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not a tourist trap and authentic local snacks and beer. I can't be wrong with this place if you want to grab a beer. Meatballs good, but bit too salty and liver sausage outstanding with best pickled cucumber."
4,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place for a drink. Genuine and authentic.  Lovely staff. If you like a genuine drinking  experience you will be happy here

12,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic old style bar! The beer is amazing!
13,De Engelse Reet, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Small and cozy place. Hasn't been updated in years and that is part of the charm. The meatballs, served with mustard are outstanding. We had to get a second order they were so good. Large selection of beers are reasonable prices."
14,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This old bar is more than it appears. Not only is it one of the older bars in Amsterdam, it has a great staff that is more than happy to give a solid recommendation of beer or liquor. Sitting there, you can feel the history as locals come to converse with the bartenders and enjoy the beer. Prices are reasonable, and staff is AMAZING!"

17,De Engelse Reet, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"It is kind of an odd place, when I walked in I was faced with like a lounge and no bar. I then realised there is some kind of bar in the back where someone will bring you a beer. The beer range is pretty decent and the quality is very good, lots of life. It is not that I didn't like the place I just felt like I was in a hunters cabin."
18,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The place has been in the family for the past 4 generations. No music in the place but it allows more of a social atmosphere. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to have a large selection of beer and alcohol but also being able …

28,De Engelse Reet, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Man, this is the best place to drink beer in the world. Denis, the guy that looks like Jean Claude Van Damme, is amazing! So kind and helpful.
