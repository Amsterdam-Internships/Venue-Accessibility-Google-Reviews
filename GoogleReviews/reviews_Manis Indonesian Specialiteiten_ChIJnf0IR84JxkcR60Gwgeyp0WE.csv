1,Manis Indonesian Specialiteiten, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice and authentic food, terrific goat sate. Very good prices as well - bought complete dinner for three for 25 euros. Take-out mainly, but four chairs as well."
2,Manis Indonesian Specialiteiten, 1 star ,4 years ago,"If you like this you probably never ate really indonesian food. Bad service and the food was tasteless i never had before I didnt want to finish my food. The day after my belly was telling me why, only toilet day.."
3,Manis Indonesian Specialiteiten, 1 star ,2 years ago,"12 euros for bami whereas other places in Amsterdam offer a similar size portion for about 7 euros, and they gave mostly bami with a little bit of meat and vegetables, could definitely give some more vegetables to make it a decent portion"
4,Manis Indonesian Specialiteiten, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Taste was quite good but the food was literaly swimming in oil. And I don't mean a bit greasy but at least 1cm of oil in each of the 4 meals we had.
5,Manis Indonesian Specialiteiten, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Staff is nice and friendly. Food is below average. Very greasy and lacked any seasoning. Plus it's premade so doesn't taste so fresh.
