0,I Trulli, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"I wanted to like this place but I didn't.  Not the best Italian food I had. Plate was hot but food wasn't.  Super pricey.  Alot of people were ordering the fish. Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. We all had pasta and we all did not enjoy it much. Wine , bread , dessert were great."
1,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good experience at I Trulli. Went during restaurant week and the portion sizes were still very big.The stracciatella (mozzarella cheese with pickled eggplant) was delicious. The owner was also very nice. Will definitely be back!
2,I Trulli, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Decided to come here for dinner one day and was really impressed. The staff were super friendly, the interiors was wonderful especially sitting near the fire place they had made me feel so warm and cozy. All the food I had there were …"
3,I Trulli, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Service was great at the beginning of the meal but so-so after we ordered despite the place being empty. Food was good but we've had better food at places with far lower prices. I'm used to eating at an italian place in rural Pennsylvania …
4,I Trulli, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really wonderful food in a welcoming environment. Every dish was truly outstanding. Seafood and rabbit are two major proteins in cuisine from Puglia so there are many great options on the menu. High recommend the rabbit ragu as well as the stratciatella appetizer.  The owner is also very knowledge about wines.
5,I Trulli, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place needs more stars, especially on Yelp. If you’re looking for authentic Italian food from Puglia - which is the heel region of Italy, you need to make your way here. …"
6,I Trulli, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I have spent a lot of time in Italy both personally and for work and have a deep appreciation for Italian food and the various regions. From an atmosphere and ambiance perspective, I Trulli came across as old and a neighborhood place. Don’t …"
7,I Trulli, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I love this restaurant. Their homemade pastas are delicious. I love supporting this warm, family run restaurant. I have been enjoying it for years. It is such a treat."
8,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was good, but I was a bit disappointed to be honest. I had seen some photos on Instagram and Google, and I think I had built it up to be something it wasn't. …"
9,I Trulli, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Ok I so went several years ago but the prices have stayed the same. Excellent value for the money. Super authentic food for the region.
10,I Trulli, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Good bread basket with ricotta, solid pastas (we got lasagna and ravioli), but nothing about it was special - not seeing what the raves are saying."
11,I Trulli, 1 star ,7 months ago,We didn’t even try the food!! A large group of us decided to go here for dinner on Friday. My husband and I weren’t super hungry so we wanted to share an appetizer and a pasta special along with another couple - this clearly made the waiter …
12,I Trulli, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Best pasta I’ve ever had!! So good!!! I come at least 2 times every time I visit NYC!
13,I Trulli, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We heard about i Trulli featured on a tv segment with home made pasta by Nonna Dora making it there for 30 years so we dined for our 13th wedding anniversary.
Started with mussels in white wine sauce. About 10 did not open. The kitchen …"
14,I Trulli, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great family style Italian food. Awe atmosphere and really good service!!
15,I Trulli, 5 stars ,7 months ago,UNREAL... We had the absolute best dining experience and it wasn't just the food. The service was impeccable. I will be returning to I Trulli next time I am in NYC and bringing anyone I can to accompany me.
16,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful and graceful service, beautiful seating both indoor and outdoor, plates are a bit pricey to be honest but they would pay off."
17,I Trulli, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"Dined here with my wife and son on a Friday night.  Sat in their outdoor garden room which was nice and warm because they employ multiple propane heaters.  Good wines by the glass.  I did not like the pulpo (octopus) appetizer, but the …"
18,I Trulli, 5 stars ,a year ago,The food was great and the staff were very friendly.  The pasta is fresh and delicious
19,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very good food as well as ambiance. Dish was a little bit salty. Great service!
20,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,My work had a large gathering here so my review will be targeted at a large catered event. …
21,I Trulli, 2 stars ,3 months ago,Menu was quite different than the one posted online. Food was just okay. Service mediocre.
22,I Trulli, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Just got back from a Restaurant week dinner with friends. Awesome menu. Good service. Will go back again soon.
23,I Trulli, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great pasta and great hosts! Good kips bay joint.
24,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"So. Good. We were visiting from out of town and stopped by for an early dinner. We got there right before the dinner rush and all the tables were reserved except for one. Everything we ordered was delicious, including tiramisu for dessert. …"
25,I Trulli, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Very disappointing. The dishes were just competent, not transporting; some not even that. NYC is blessed with great Italian restaurants, where eating pasta is communing with the divine, but the pasta that we had here -- tomatoes & rabbit …"
26,I Trulli, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food is fantastic! We had the octopus salad (Pulpo), scallop crudo and I had the gnocchi. Cooked to perfection and flavors were 👌.
Covid-19 measures: outdoor space was plentiful, plenty of 2-tops and up to …"
27,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food. Some of the best hand made pastas I've ever had. Nona Dora is there everyday hand making ask the pasta, and she is very approachable, and friendly. If you want Italian around the flat iron district, this place is a must try."
28,I Trulli, 1 star ,a year ago,I wanted fresh pasta. I ordered the lasagna. Nothing special. My own lasagna is better. The pasta was overcooked. Portion was skimpy. I’m working in NY and just wanted something special. Very disappointed. My shake shake was far better for …
29,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I saw I Trulli on Food Insider and was very excited to try Dora Marzovilla's handmade pasta--I Trulli delivered! The atmosphere, food, and service are excellent. We celebrated my sister's birthday here, and the staff went above and beyond to make her dining experience memorable. Highly recommend!"
30,I Trulli, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is charming and homey but the food just wasn’t good. The seafood pasta dish was so fishy, meaning they probably used frozen shrimp. The sauces didn’t have much flavor. The only thing I really enjoyed was the free burrata cheese that came with the breadsticks. Not only was the food mediocre but overpriced as well."
31,I Trulli, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I had a family member that used to work here about 5-6 years ago and when i visited her I thought it was excellent. I went back recently and was appalled at how bad it was. Service was terrible, the waitress must have been on Xanax or …"
32,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best Italian restaurants in NYC.  Thoughtful preparation from a great family owned and operated establishment.  This is not a red sauce, checkered table cloth, and big portions place.  Go for the quality and variety, and see Christopher for the right wine pairings."
33,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious pasta! Very nice ambiance!
34,I Trulli, 1 star ,a year ago,"Frustrating customer experience. Ordered online for pickup and when arrived in-store, manager(?) claimed the ordered items do not exist and was aggressive and rude. A kind waitress helped resolve the manager's attitude and lack of service. Will not come back."
35,I Trulli, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This restaurant was designed like a living room with a fire place. Its nice and comfy. In the back they have a portion that looks patio-ish/green house. I tried a fixed course meal and it was good not great.  I want to boast about the …
36,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I Trulli helped to make my birthday TRULLI special! Our server - Dominic, I think- went above and beyond in making sure we were accommodated, and the manager or owner was sure to check on us as well. A smaller part of our group arrived …"
37,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Hand made pasta by Nona right there.  Nice cozy ambience in the yard as well. Good service too. Food and wine were good as well. I'm taking off a star because the bathroom wasn't up to par with the rest of the place at all.
38,I Trulli, 5 stars ,6 years ago,My wife and I had the pleasure of having dinner at this great restaurant last Saturday. We were warmly greeted and were seated at a quiet table in the back corner .The atmosphere is wonderful and the restaurant has a beautiful fireplace …
39,I Trulli, 4 stars ,3 years ago,My girlfriend and I had trouble finding a place to eat but were lucky enough to get reservations at I Trulli. First arriving there we definitely noticed we were the youngest in the crowd which didn't bother us but just felt a little weird. …
40,I Trulli, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Almost liked the plate clean! Cute garden in the back of the restaurant, great cocktails, fantastic short ribs over pecorino smashed potatoes. Owner was such a pleasure to talk with and I’ll definitely be back!"
41,I Trulli, 3 stars ,3 months ago,Its OK.  I have had better Italian in the city.
42,I Trulli, 1 star ,a year ago,"The host (who appeared to be the owner, and I guess this excuses him for being so condescending when talking with customers) at the restaurant is extremely rude, disrespectful and unprofessional. He didn’t seat us and told us to either …"
43,I Trulli, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"WOW!!!!!!!  We absolutely loved this restaurant.  The service was excellent, the food was amazing and the place was so cute and comfortable.  The next time I am in Manhattan, I will be sure to make a special trip just to eat here again. …"
44,I Trulli, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Lovely service in a beautiful setting. The wine list is only Italian and those paisans cannot make a white that  doesn't taste like turpentine. Boo.
Expensive by the glass. My wife makes better lasagna. …"
45,I Trulli, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I joined some friends for dessert on Saturday night. They said their dinner was EXCELLENT and I loved the dessert. The waitress was fun but not in your face, I loved my limoncello and the sorbet was really good.  Chocolate cake was to die for. I would totally come here again."
46,I Trulli, 4 stars ,8 years ago,Rustic setting lends to memorable southern Italian dining experience. The garden is great for eating al fresco and a wood burning fireplace provides a comfortable ambiance during the colder months.The food was good. Nothing that blows you …
47,I Trulli, 5 stars ,a year ago,Have been here a few times and I can comfortably say this is the best dining experience you can ask for from a resturant. Amazing food and really amazing service.
48,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I visited because Nona Dora is a star in social media. It did not disappoint me. Pasta is perfect and authentic. Place is small but cozy. Late review, I visited in June. I had a picture with Nona. Thank you Ma’am!"
49,I Trulli, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Greatest food with exceptional service!
50,I Trulli, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, pasta, wine, dessert, Negronis, and a huge outdoor patio!"
51,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A NYC gem! This place has been around for about 25 years and not much has changed. The woners 83 year old mother (Dora) still hand rolls pasta every weekday during lunch service, bread is made twice a day and they even make their own …"
52,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I've been here a few times and the food is absolutely delicious! Service is also top notch. Knocking a star for how pricy it is and last time I went a moth landed on our calamari. Otherwise looking forward to my next outing here.
53,I Trulli, 4 stars ,9 years ago,Just off of Park Ave. in Murray Hill sits an Italian gem complete with a fire place and back garden. It’s a nice respite from the cheap Bud Lights to the east and post work watering holes on Park.  I Trulli is a great spot for some tasty …
54,I Trulli, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Fantastic experience!! Great cocktails, and even better food. We did takeout and it was all so delicious. Definitely going back"
55,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very pleasant interior, good waitstaff and very good food selection. Certainly worth a slightly higher pricing but cannot question the quality or portions.
Highly recommended."
56,I Trulli, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I Trulli gets its name from the traditional homes in the bucolic Puglia region of Italy, famous for its tomatoes, olives and of course beaches.  Luckily, the restaurant doesn't attempt to duplicate the hackneyed ""rustic charm"" one often …"
57,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The service was superb. I felt like family and was treated as such throughout my entire dining experience. This has become one of my favorite restaurants in Manhattan!
58,I Trulli, 4 stars ,10 years ago,"Great atmosphere, friendly staff. This review is for iTrulli's offers Enoteca to Go service which *was* offered from 11 am till 3 p.m. My favorite item is the egg & pepper sandwich - it's very filling and satisfying. A large coffee is less …"
59,I Trulli, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Consistently delicious and no worse for being long-established, I Trulli never loses its ability to delight us with the most delicious and authentically Italian dishes. On my latest visit, I was offered my branzino on or off the bone and it was perfect. The home made pasta is second to none, too."
60,I Trulli, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"Excellent Italian food, terrific service.   From beginning to end, coffee excellent.  Owner and wait staff very engaged and charming, provide excelllent service.  Wish this lovely restaurant was closer to us on the UES.
Still, worth the trip for every delicious morsel."
61,I Trulli, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was mediocre at best.  I've had much better Italian food for less money in New York City.  Overpriced, small portions.  Mushrooms side dish was oddly bitter and inedible."
62,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Superb neighborhood spot featuring authentic Puglian cuisine — the wild boar rack plate is a must — in rustic/chic digs and with a note-worthy Negroni menu to complement the pasta starters
63,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super friendly waiter that managed to accept a special request and deliver the exact dish I wanted. Thanks for the flexibility. The GF pasta was fab too!
64,I Trulli, 4 stars ,8 years ago,While the food often has a rustic appeal - it is honest and quite good - the prospect of dining out in the lovely garden on a gentle Spring day or summer evening and sipping a glass of straw-colored wine from the extensive list makes this long-established spot a seductive delight.
65,I Trulli, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"I was really excited to eat at I Trulli, based on its high Zagat rating and all of the good reviews I read about it. …"
66,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place. We celebrate our holiday party here and the pasta was delicious. Also, it was very nice that I could watch how they make the pasta."

68,I Trulli, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The Food could have been better prepared unless We booked at home.
The Service was excellent friendly and courteous."
69,I Trulli, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Service took forever.
Servers focused on seeking you something expensive vs what you asked for.
Servers would not split the bill, nor setup split build in the first place. …"

76,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favorite Italian restaurant in NYC - excellent and simple food, homemade pastas (by an 80+ year old ""gonna""), amazing wine list, and friendly, non-fussy service."
77,I Trulli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been here twice - first time was underwhelmed, second time everyone raved about the food. I think the more recent experience is representative and am willing to suggest it for folks in the neighborhood."
78,I Trulli, 1 star ,4 years ago,Extremely overpriced for what you get. The wine is very expensive and disgusting and they could use a more talented cook. Service is good and decor is nice though. Will never return because I don't like to get ripped off.
79,I Trulli, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Great restaurant!  Wonderful authentic food.  Romantic for the winter.  And refreshing during Spring & Summer.  Wonderful wine offerings as well!

81,I Trulli, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Trulli mundane food. Specialty featured on Best Thing I Ever Ate, Rabbit Orecchiette, blah. A dish called Burnt Pasta, an embarrassment. Took an Italian friend from Italy here, by the grace of God, she's still speaking to me."
82,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and ambiance. Portions were on the small side, but maybe that’s just because it was the restaurant week menu."
83,I Trulli, 1 star ,a year ago,"Horrible experience - awful service, didn’t have 1/2 the items on their restaurant week menu"
84,I Trulli, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"I read about I Trulli when it first opened many years ago and put off going there--do I regret it!  It was such a delight this first experience!!!  The food, service, atmosphere, attention of the staff was superb!!!!  We cannot wait to go back again!!!!!"

87,I Trulli, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Expensive and the food is so so. Service is lacking. Order hot tea after lunch and a carafe of coffee is brought. Small portions.
88,I Trulli, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Meatballs were served cold and replaced, main dishes were over salted. Tiramisu was disappointing."

90,I Trulli, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Overpriced for no reason. Felt like a tourist trap even though I am not a tourist and this is not really a touristy area.. Food and wine are just OK..
91,I Trulli, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Food fab and only reason I did not give it a 5 is that it is a little pricey.  Very nice spot in this part of town and I try to go whenever I am there!

94,I Trulli, 4 stars ,17 years ago,"Perhaps there's no such thing as a real Italian restaurant in the US, the I Trulli comes close. Of course, it's more northern than from around the trulli in the southeast, but so what?"

98,I Trulli, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The butternut squash tortellini was amazing. The only thing I would change is the music.
99,I Trulli, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Food excellent at lunch, but a few service missteps: slow to check on us after food was placed, slow to offer dessert and bring check, one drink order never came, coat check was completely unattended and unnoticed for nearly 10 minutes (!) after our meal."
