0,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very interesting place. I quite like the theme decoration, and i give them thumbs up for the cocktails. Not what i am used to but nice still. I liked the Boombastic one. Also super cute coasters, and they even used anime pages to serve some Cocktails on,so quite interesting. Music was nice as well."

5,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"The place is clean. The karaoke room si nice and spacious. The sound system is nice, you can adjust the mic, music, and echo volume. There are only 2 mic, so if you're coming with more than 6 people it'll be nice to bring something like a ‚Ä¶"
6,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We had the most fun ever! The nicest staff ever, a must do in amsterdam"
7,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The bar looks amazing, especially the decoration around the karaoke rooms. Drinks are also nice and prices are okay for Amsterdam standards. All in all great place to go but can be packed so arrive early."
8,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We came here for the karaoke session. It‚Äôs the best to book a session at least 3 weeks in advance if you plan to come here during weekends. You can order drinks with a tablet inside the room, which is very handy! We ordered the spring ‚Ä¶"

Walking in, the environment was welcoming and inviting as well as creating an ‚Ä¶"
10,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was really an awesome find!  The karaoke was in rooms, so that part wasn't what I thought, so I didn't sing here, but the ambiance was nifty, no food unfortunately, but the bar tenders were attractive :)"
11,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place with good drinks selection. We were a large group and had enough space in the private room. It seems there are no snack on Mondays! so be aware.

14,Duke of Tokyo, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"The place is Japan themed but has no Japanese songs. Somewhat limited song selection, but has majority of popular songs. Drinks were also really expensive."
15,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,We had the Shibuya booth for my birthday celebration.  Had a great time and they even had my cake aside for a few hours before we came in. Highly recommend
16,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"very cool decorated place, u can c they rly try their best to make it have a feeling of Japan. Karaoke was OK, the room is small and a bit too shabby I have to say and song choices are a bit limited. But if ur with a group of friends who like singing, you will for sure have a lot of fun. And prices are quite reasonable."

29,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Very nice interior, great atmosphere! Drinks a little expensive"
30,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great karaoke bar! Drinks were too pricy but I loved the set up of the karaoke rooms. Very fun atmosphere- bathrooms were terribly awkward with urinals next to the shared sink? Weird but üëçüèº
31,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Fun japanese style booths.
Decent drink prices.
Would have loved some snack options."
32,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing atmosphere! Definetely would reccomend taking a group here to do karaoke at one of their themed rooms. The decor is on point and the drinks are well mixed.
33,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good fun, Karaoke selection was HUGE and wide ranging. You can also change individual volumes and pitch if songs are too high/low.
Pricing for rooms was really decent, and the decoration has a nice touch. Had a two hour session and will definitely be back!"
34,Duke of Tokyo, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Horrible place, altho it looks good.
Staff won't serve you drinks. People who have a 'reservation' are treated like top class and non-reservants, are treated like trash. ‚Ä¶"
35,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Impressive decor/vibe/cocktails.

Wish we had more themed based bars in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
36,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best time ive had in a long time. they have really cute karaoke booths. the best part i loved about it is that the machine is so simple to use and you can change the key to the song so you can sing it in your comfortable key :)
37,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Nice atmosphere outside and inside. The cocktails tasted great and felt more inspirational/imaginative than drinks at other bars.
38,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great ambiance and environment, makes you feel like you're actually in the side streets of Tokyo"
39,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was awesome!

We had an amazing night, definitely going back! Great catalog of songs to choose from too."
40,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You want proper karaoke? The way they do it in Japan? Go here, this is the best one.
They even have modern Japanese toilets."
41,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such an incredible place! Go just for the interior design. Like being on a movie set.
42,Duke of Tokyo, 3 stars ,a year ago,Love this place. Prices per room is why the stars don't come out higher. Gets to be a bit ridiculous expensive ü§ëü§ëü§ëfor the time and no additional gratuitous service of more time like you'd actually find in Tokyo or in traditional karaoke ‚Ä¶
43,Duke of Tokyo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Staff is lacking basic skills like being friendly or acknowledging the fact they are in the customer service business- i sat there like a an invisible bystander waiting 10-15 minutes for someone to assist me! I‚Äôve been declined answer the ‚Ä¶
44,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Fun! Staffs were nice.
45,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,If you love karaoke this is a must stop! You can book a private room for a couple of hours (multiple sizes are available) and enjoy their large selection of songs (as well as their delicious cocktails). Some nights there is also a dj so you can continue your evening out after singing!

47,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely superb place and staff who are attentive and will do anything to help. We had group of 30+ people and no one needed to wait for their drinks, despite the place being packed. The karaoke rooms are spacious and with airco, and offer most of the old and gold. This place is guaranteed to give you a good night out."
48,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Its always amazing experience going to Duke of Tokyo, the people, staff worker are so lovely, fun, a commendative, spontaneous and experience customer services ‚ô•Ô∏èüòÇüí°üáØüá≤."
49,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I'm not a karaoke singer, but loved everything about this. From the Tokyo theme, to the small room with your private karaoke machine, to the weird tablet system to order drinks... Had a blast. Probably one of the more fun things to do in town during covid."
50,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Expensive alcohol, karaoke cabinets are expensive too. Drinks are okay okayesh.
Great ambiance, great service and all very clean and well cared for."
51,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great karaoke place! I‚Äôve been here a couple of times with my friends and we had a lot of fun.

52,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing decor, great for drinking and karaoke"
53,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very fun karaoke with private rooms, plenty of comfy booth seating with cushions and easy to use devices to select songs and drinks. Pay by the hour. Bathroom is stalled toilets shared by both men and women. Room gets hot though with a few bodies and gets hotter the more drinks you have!"
54,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Looove this bar, it's just a shame that I haven't yet tried the karaoke.

Always good music, a bit of a mix so everyone can listen to something they like. ‚Ä¶"
55,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice intimate place to do your Karaoke thing where nobody can see you
56,Duke of Tokyo, 3 stars ,3 months ago,Felt like the place was too pricey...we paid for 30 min tallest as much as we paid for 2 hours
57,Duke of Tokyo, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Very friendly people and good service.

But they have a new Karaoke System that only consists of only English and some ‚Ä¶"
58,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Quite nice collection of songs to sing. Set up is also great. You get your own room with a TV and 2 mics where you and your friends can have kareoke in private. You order drinks on a tablet

60,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome place ... Cool staff and nice drinks . I loved the concept
61,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great fun, we booked two hours in a booth and drunkenly sang the night away. Nice decor and liked being able to order drinks from the booth. They didn't have 'Love Can't Turn Around' though, and this disappointment has cost them a star..."
62,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing Karaoke Bar, great drinks, amazing rooms to enjoy and have fun with your friends. If you're looking for a fun night out look no further than the Duke of Tokyo!"
63,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice karaoke with japanese street decoration. It is fun guaranteed for the appreciators of singing out loud. The technology inside the rooms (tablet) makes it very easy to add music, search, etc"
64,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Second birthday in a row, another blast! Getting a private Booth is worth the price to sing the songs you want. Massive selection of songs across the spectrum, a cool retrofuturist decor, and convenient service. I'm glad they're opening a franchise in Utrecht."
65,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice karaoke booth, paid for a booth for two hours, but after a few beers and two hours later, we decided it was not enough and asked whether it was possible to extend our time, luckily for us this was possible without to much hassle. You ‚Ä¶"
66,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to have drinks and have some fun singing in the many karaoke booths! Cocktail game on point! The place looks like some tiny Japanese alley - a couple of drinks further one could easily find themselves wondering if they didn't teleport  from Amsterdam to Tokyo. ü§òüî•‚ù§
67,Duke of Tokyo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,This can be a fun bar. The drinks taste good and I like the decorations even if I don‚Äôt sing :) but I agree with an other review about the barman. My story is a bit funny because he tried to pick me up once and I was not interested. I went ‚Ä¶
68,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place! It looks like an old Japanese futuristic slum, it's gorgeous. Food is great and pretty original as well. There are many numbered rooms and they have averagely 2 micros each (as far as i know, not super sure). It's in the ‚Ä¶"
69,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They have private karaoke rooms, which was so much fun and I wouldn't have done it without having that private room! The decor was incredible and it got way too crowded when we first arrived around 7:45pm, but then when we left there was almost no one there."
70,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had recently visited Dukes of Tokyo for a stag night and this turned out to be the highlight of the evening. Although I have not been to many karaoke bars, this one seems to have gotten everything right. The sound system allows you to do ‚Ä¶"
71,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One awkward & confusing thing: the bathroom is unisex so I felt uncomfortably close to the guys using the urinal. ‚Ä¶
72,Duke of Tokyo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, they have different rooms but some of them are too small for a big group. I've been in the rooms that are at the beginning of the place we were a big group and we rented 4 or 5 rooms. I had a blast and I will back for sure."
73,Duke of Tokyo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Place itself is very nice. Karaoke rooms is something I was definitely missing in Amsterdam. Unfortunately service is a little bit messy, which can be a buzz kill. We have ordered second round of the drinks and they never came. We waited ‚Ä¶"
74,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Decoration is amazing, the look and feel of the place is crazy food is really good and not that expensive, I enjoyed my tiene there."
75,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Great place to have a fun night with friends singing all out loud!
76,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Great experience with friends with very nice staff but the drinks and spots were pretty expensive
77,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really cool concept. Upon arrival, we heard that one of our microphone didn't work. They would compensate it with drinks or other solutions, but we decided in the end to go somewhere else. Even though we did not do the karaoke, I give them ‚Ä¶"
78,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best karaoke bar in town !! Selection of songs are huge and cocktails.arr amazing!!
79,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Funny place in the heart of Amsterdam to sing karaoke with your friends or simply have a drink there. I reccomend to go early in the evening, otherwise the chances that it will be completely packed are high. And of course.... if you wanna sing.... book it in advance!"
80,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, moderately expensive, but you get your own room which is rare in Amsterdam! Great international song collection. Those 2 hours will go fast! Enjoyed it a lot!"
81,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very fun karaoke bar with private rooms. The rooms are nicely decorated and well air conditioned. Prices of drinks coctails are around the 10 to 14 euros which is a decent price!
82,Duke of Tokyo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Service at the start was quite good and the place/decoration itself was great. But 2 things actually ruined the experience. First the   volume of the microphone was very very low. We had to scream to be able to hear ourselves in the ‚Ä¶
83,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fun karaoke venue. Could use more songs though and we did have technical issues with one microphone being a lot more quiet than the other. Technical issues happen however and aside from that we had a great time.
84,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It‚Äôs little Tokyo in Amsterdam. Everything you like about Karaoke is there. Impressed by the amount of modern tracks. Booths are great, so you can have your own Sake party."
85,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First Japanese Karaoke bar in the Netherlands! Absolute a must see! You feel like entering Tokyo when you walk inside! Great service, friendly en helpful staff. Just an amazing Karaoke experience !"
86,Duke of Tokyo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty mediocre service by any means. Bar staff wasn't doing anything and it still took me  over 5 minutes to get my beer. Seriously, how had is something like that? ‚Ä¶"
87,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Guaranteed good vibes; cocktails and great DJs feature regularly, but crucially the decor is incredible with lots of Chinese lanterns dangling from the ceiling and even those super advanced toilets you usually only find in Japan.
Bring a 5 euro note so you can use the espresso martini machine ;)"
88,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place. Private rooms and a big collection of music (definitely not everything, but more than enough to make it a fun night out). Thought it was pricey at first. But the prices are more than worth it. Especially for Amsterdam"
89,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good funky music. It moves you. The waitress is very friendly and helpful. It takes a little time to take your drinks, nevertheless a fine place to visit with tasty drinks!!!!! Cheeeeeeeers!!!!"
90,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome bar. Fantastic bartenders and waitstaff. Private karaoke rooms that looked really cool. I didn't go in. Bathroom decor makes for great Snapchat material.
91,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In the heart of Amsterdam, is this gem that guarantees and fun night out. Actually super private fun in your own booth and with friendly staff giving you anything you need. You feel like entering Japan! So really can recommend this when in Amsterdam... Riding the dragon before you go to this place makes it extra funny and special."
92,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best karaoke place in town.
93,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great Karaoke/Noraebang place. Finally a place that is not just a karaoke bar but actually a place with rooms for each group. Really enjoyed everything especially the lead vocal that you can adjust for each singer in a duett even. Idk one ‚Ä¶
94,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beers great music and a killer decoration, I really enjoy the corridor that put you straight in a whole new city somewhere in Asia, big plus, the toilet showing Takeshi s castle is just great you should drop by even if you don't wanna karaoke"
95,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wowwwww we came in with a group of friends not really knowjng what to expect but this place is so crazy cool!!! Loved our karaoke booth and the staff was really friendly, drinks were amazing and we had the best time singing!!! Will come back for sure!!!!"
96,Duke of Tokyo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Their chicken was not good at all, I have never tasted such a dry tasteless chicken before..nd after I got a very bad diarrhea for few days. so Quite disappointed about the situation with the food because the bar itself was fun with nice music and decorations"
97,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fun place to go with a group. YOU have your own private room to sing and laugh! I would say the drinks are very expensive! SO eat and drink before you go.
98,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We ended our crew day with a privte kraoke room hire and it was definitely the highlight of the day. Thanks Ben and Doortje for organising it all and treating us so well. Will definitely come back!

103,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice decor. Only lyric videos are available. (No MVs) Be aware though that no Mandarin songs are available. Wide song selection from 80s to present.
104,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best night ever! Get yourself here, especially if you have never done it. A few drinks in and you will have the time of your life, just let go as nobody is watching haha!!"
105,Duke of Tokyo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Authentic Japanese design. Good cocktails. Sleazy bartender.

Thanks for the reply. This bartender did not understand that I was uninterested ‚Ä¶"
106,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We mainly went for the seperate room for our own karaoke night. Easy to manage with the tablet and you can also order your drinks from the room which they bring
107,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Crazy place and very nice Drinks!
You feel like you're in a different world, entering this place. Especially when you see the toilets. ‚Ä¶"

113,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A lot of fun Japanese style Karaoke rooms. Definitely on the expensive side, but I guess for the lack of other comparable options in Amsterdam, it's fair-ish."
114,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing atmosphere you have the impression to be in Tokyo. Definitely a place to visit for one drink or for sing.
115,Duke of Tokyo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nicely themed. I've not been to Japan but I can confirm that the beer, decor and even toilets seem what I imagine is typically Japanese!"
116,Duke of Tokyo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fatastic scenery inside and out. It's a make believe place in Tokyo located on the gayfriendly street of the city. Please stop by and check your vocal cords after a glass or two.
