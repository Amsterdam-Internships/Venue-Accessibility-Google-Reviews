0,Bolle Jan, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Traditional, super dutch!"
1,Bolle Jan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A tiny little bar which could fit 50 in at a push. I went on a Monday night and there was singing and dancing as if it we the weekend.
The singer sung a mix of Dutch and English songs and the vibe was welcoming of tourists but not made for tourists - well worth a visit."
2,Bolle Jan, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I have been here several times in the past and I always enjoyed it. Today I brought two Asian friends of mine here, and we were stopped by the door man, who told us it's full (but it's not) and there is no point waiting. I can't find a word ‚Ä¶"
3,Bolle Jan, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the oddest places I ever visited in my life. Great if you like a traditional Amsterdam setup, but it was ever so surreal. The music was dreadful and it was odd to have to tip the toilet lady - after a lot of beers you see her a lot. ‚Ä¶"
4,Bolle Jan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is incredible. We came from Chicago and stumbled upon this place, and it was the best find of the trip. 95% locals (we're still not sure if we were even supposed to be there!), and a Dutch singer singing Dutch singalong songs ‚Ä¶"
5,Bolle Jan, 1 star ,5 years ago,I tried to enter this bar on Saturday night and the entrance was blocked. The argument is that this bar is only for locals (the security guy was a typical Dutch guy from Suriname or some orther place). I didnt try to change is mind but I'm as local as he is... this is racism and is not acceptable for a city as Amsterdam.
6,Bolle Jan, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Music was loud, crowd was dancing and the guy singing was great. I didn't know hardly any songs but the vibe was infectious. Bartenders were smiling and singing, music created 100db, and I learned who Rene Froger is."
7,Bolle Jan, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good. Live singer, full bar. Famous and a little corny. Wonderful!"
8,Bolle Jan, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great memories of fantastic night here in 1998. Great Bar, Great atmosphere, great staff"

19,Bolle Jan, 1 star ,7 months ago,"(Translated by Google) We were inside with a group of 10 girls, because we didn't throw in liters of alcohol, we were evicted.

31,Bolle Jan, 1 star ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Worthless tent when someone comes in, the music goes louder? If you order a beer, it is a jupiler and you have to pay immediately, that for a cozy Amsterdam bar, after 1 beer, there is no hospitality at all ‚Ä¶"

36,Bolle Jan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Had a great evening in April in Bolle Jan with Danny Froger on stage. When he heard that we were from Limburg, he also deployed Limburg by Rowwen H√®ze. So we had a great evening and nice bar ladies. ‚Ä¶"
37,Bolle Jan, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"(Translated by Google) I've been coming here for years, it's just like my living room, really coming home. Of course I can't help but also sing a song in this artist caf√©. See you again soon üòÉ ‚Ä¶"
38,Bolle Jan, 3 stars ,5 years ago,(Translated by Google) It is a small cafe that actually has too many people inside. For the toilet you pay 0.50 which I actually do not think belong in a cafe. A beer is 2.95 but a small glass. ‚Ä¶
