2,Jazz Cafe Alto, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,"This is not a jazz club, is a bar. The crowd is *so loud,* you can‚Äôt hear the music at all unless you‚Äôre sitting in a front table. In American jazz and blues clubs, it‚Äôs considered rude to speak much louder than a whisper ‚Äî if at all ‚Äî ‚Ä¶"

9,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This bar has a great vibe and you can hear the jazz all the way from the back. I advise that you arrive when it begins because when we went, the music ended at 10, despite the bar being open until later."
10,Jazz Cafe Alto, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A very cozy bar and jazz club with great live music (a cover charge of ‚Ç¨5 seems to apply). Why only 3 stars? This place is very crowded - to the point where moving is difficult,  getting a drink is very slow and the air is stifling. In case ‚Ä¶"

20,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The music. It's an ordinary cosy pub, but the trio; Banchet, Teepe and Hart, brought the place to life. Three really talented musicians, play in tandem with such agility, cueing and anticipating each other with mastery that can only be attained through long association.

44,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been coming here for the past 18 years. Was very upset when it was closed for a couple of years. A cozy small true jazz club.

46,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Saw one of the best jazz shows ever here. It‚Äôs a bit small, but that makes it all the better. The servers are friendly and attentive. Five euro cover charge was well worth it for the talented band. I was here before and there was no cover charge. Depends on the bad I guess."
47,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So much fun! We saw a Latin vibe band and managed to find a table almost right after walking in. Table service for drinks and people come and go, so if it's full when you first arrive, don't despair! If you wait a second a table will ‚Ä¶"

53,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A very cozy place with live music. Make sure you are there when the door opens @9pm to secure good seats. A nice selection of drinks...cocktails are 10 eur average (eg G&T or old fashioned). It gets crowded after 10pm.
54,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoyed a fantastic night of Latin Jazz with a slew of musicians from around the world. Get there early and grab a drink because this place will fill up quickly. The spot is a bit discreet, but it‚Äôs near several restaurants in a busier part of town. The vibe inside is casual and cozy."
55,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very nice jazz spot in Amsterdam. Cozy atmosphere. Great music. Free entry, then you have to pay for the drinks. It offers both alcoholic and no-alcohol drinks. It has a choice of snacks too. It is strongly recommended in every season."
56,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best places for jazz that I have been. And I love jazz and have been in many places before. There is a perfect environment, the waiters really kind. Nothing to say but good things. And for sure, the concert was really good."
57,Jazz Cafe Alto, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic jazz in the center of Amsterdam. The entrance is an obstacle that will work well for some people and less so for others. I personally prefer a free entrance, but the drink selection and music there was very good."
58,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cool, laid back jazz bar. The night I visited had an excellent jazz quartet from Cuba, Dominican Republic, Suriname and Holland. Excellent players and very friendly after the show. I will definitely be back!"

60,Jazz Cafe Alto, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Said to be one of the oldest jazz bars in Europe! Stopped by on a (unplanned) layover but had a good time. Great live jazz music and nice drinks to match.
61,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cozy bar and not very touristy even though it‚Äôs right by leidsplein. Music started at 22, but the place was packed way before that. The music was loud, so not a place to go to talk, but great place, good music, and nice service. One drink per person/seat however."
62,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Venue preserved in it's original condition since 1953, great vibe! A double set started at 9:30 and the jazz quartet was incredible! The service matched with a packed out house.  We were still out early enough to catch the #2 Tram back across town. Looking forward to the encore : )"
63,Jazz Cafe Alto, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very busy. Check the acts. The crowd turns over every 45 mins ish so groups leaving and arriving mid set can be annoying.  Great table service. Definitely worth a visit if you need a fix!

67,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing live music. We went on a Saturday night and we had to pay a 5 euros entrance, totally worth it!!!
However, the place is very small,so make sure there's a spot for you or you will have to remain stand up."
68,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I don't understand why this place is not visited by more people. Drink prices are ok, the music is good, what more do people want?! Live music every night, audio is ok, you have a chance to be very close to the band or a bit further. There are about two separate spaces (or at least I saw only two). Cool spot in such a cool city!"
69,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Went to Cafe Alto on my first visit to Amsterdam and loved the atmosphere and music! They gave me a shout-out on my birthday, very cool of them! Highly recommend this as a chill spot to hangout and enjoy some great jazz!"

82,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We went twice. The first night was a 5 euro charge and was very hot and crowded. They just kept letting more people in.The jazz wasn't to my taste and we left early. It was much better on the  next night which was free and I had a great time.

85,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Smoky, crowded, hot - in short, a great jazz club in the heart of town. Interesting characters at the bar and decent to excellent jazz every night of the week, including Christmas! Highly recommended."
86,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A very nice place, its small and cosy. Where you can enjoy LIVE jazz. Sometimes entrance is free and sometimes you pay EUR5.
But it is all worth it. When you are there, watch for the old man, who has some nice moves!"

By the way, their sound system is really old."
93,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The Best Jazz Cafe of The Netherlands. You can meet people from all over the world here. Always interesting live music. My first visit was in the year 2001 or 2000. Then Hans Dulfur was organising the program for the week and played himself ‚Ä¶

96,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great jazz club, every night had something on but they differ so depending on what kind of jazz you like they have a night here for you. It is a bit of a squeeze so get ready to stand and squeeze through but worth it."

98,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic atmosphere good spot for life music.
99,Jazz Cafe Alto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It doesn't get much better than this. In a world where jazz music is dying this intimate club is keeping it alive. If you haven't experienced this place before you are in for a treat. Seating is limited.
100,Jazz Cafe Alto, 1 star ,4 years ago,The bar was good but we were really disappointed by the band (Gidon Nuz Vaz). They were  extremely rude in asking us to leave for talking. I'd understand politely asking us to leave or telling us to quiet down. May try again if another band was there.
