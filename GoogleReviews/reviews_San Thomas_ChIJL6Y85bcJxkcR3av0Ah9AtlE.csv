0,San Thomas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really enjoyed this meal, as recommended by our hotel. Soup was a little salty but overall, everything was great!
Carpaccio; Sirloin; Concales; Beef Bouillon."
1,San Thomas, 1 star ,5 months ago,Tasteless meat. Tasteless onion rings. Tasteless baked potato. Asked for some mayonnaise for the baked potato and they put the mayonnaise in the microwave!!! Cold drink isn't cold. Service is non existent as the staff are constantly out of sight.
2,San Thomas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Service wasn't slow as others said but there weren't too many people inside ; still, the waiter was very nice and helpful. Meat was at least good, if not above, but prices are indeed on the high side (not super expensive, just high). NOT A BAD CHOICE!"
3,San Thomas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We ate at this restaurant 3 out of the 5 days we were here! It was so worth it. And when the chef, Diego, found out it was my girlfriend's birthday, he gave us the biggest piece of Tiramisu that we vacuumed up. The staff was amazing, especially Karim, who gave us wonderful service. Go here!"
4,San Thomas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, friendly English speaking staff. Prices ok. Food came quickly and was hot and tasty"
5,San Thomas, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very slow service. We ordered sirloin steak it came full of fat. Not edible. Overpriced. Waited for food for min 30 minutes. The steak comes ALONE on the plate with nothing on the side. Asked for mustard came in a sachet!!!!!! From the fridge. Not recommended.
6,San Thomas, 3 stars ,7 months ago,The food was a bit bland and the plates looked a bit like minimal effort. The waiter was nice.
7,San Thomas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Only good thing was the meat. It's way overpriced compared to what you get and some of the worst service I ever experienced! He arrived at our table 3 times without getting a order (even though we were ready), the 4th time another customer …"
8,San Thomas, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Quite disappointed by the food. The cheese plater was mostly salad with a very poor choice of cheeses for the price. The Lasagna tasted like frozen lasagna and I basically had no idea of what was in my salad before ordering. …
9,San Thomas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place. We ordered the dish of the day (ribs) and it was delicios!
10,San Thomas, 1 star ,11 months ago,"Worst experience ever, the food was not good and the WI-FI wasn't working. I told about the WI-FI was not working to the waiter and he didn't say anything, just that I have to log in(maybe he didn't understand). Then in the end, he asked me …"
11,San Thomas, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst restaurant I've been so far. Got food poisoning and vomiting all my tuna thanks to them. I recommend if you like your food as much on the way in as on the way out.
12,San Thomas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Only two good points : the meat is delicious (entrecôte), and the place is well decorated.
It's too much expensive for what it is. Salads aren't tasty. The meat is served …"
13,San Thomas, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Service was fast. Pizza had minimal sauce, cheese and other toppings. I asked for more sauce and it took them 10 minutes to come back and tell me that it's costs 3euros. Pizza came out cold so I'm not sure what it they have them waiting on standby."
14,San Thomas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The ribs are great,but the rest of the food is not amazing. Not bad,but there is nore place for the best"
15,San Thomas, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Pizza was nice but service was so slow, and food was brought incrementally meaning that we weren't able to eat together. To compound this, they forgot one pizza from the order so it was even more delayed. Requesting the bill took 3 attempts. Calamitous."
16,San Thomas, 1 star ,2 years ago,Service and food horrible ...there s nothing about the italian taste ...
17,San Thomas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food is good but the service isn't great for big groups. However it's a central location and easy to get too.
18,San Thomas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I don't understand the bad reviews, we ate here and had excellent service and one of the best steaks we have ever had, and we are Scottish! We will definitely be back, thank you to the man on the door who enticed us in to this unassuming little restaurant."
19,San Thomas, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The wine was overpriced and lousy, the food (we had pasta) was boring, fatty and definitely not fresh. WiFi only when you agree to receive ads. The atmosphere however was nice. Our recommendation: Go elsewhere."
20,San Thomas, 1 star ,a year ago,I don’t recommend. The food and even soft drinks were overpriced for the portions and quality delivered.
21,San Thomas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great pizzas, friendly staff who make you feel very welcome, very quick to serve and clean toilets too!"
22,San Thomas, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Disappointed when we got to pay the bill and the manager had to explain that he could not receive the payment from more than two payment cards. (guess to minimize the taxes on the transaction). Such a pain!
23,San Thomas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Fast service, nice food, but the drink prices were absurd. 6.50€ for a 500ml glass of coke."
24,San Thomas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The pasta was really good as well as the meat. And the staff is very friendly. A very good place to eat.
25,San Thomas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Until now, one of the few places where I ate good food, in Amsterdam! I always eat pizza and lasagna here, different choices, always good! The employees are really friendly and never had problems! Don't understand bad reviews as service and …"
26,San Thomas, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Staff was nice. The food was overpriced for the delivered quality. Our medium fillet steak turned out to be chewy on one half.
27,San Thomas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the food and wine by ltr.
28,San Thomas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is unmatched by everything that was perfect, the quality of the food, the prices and the staff, I thank the staff who are doing this work as I come to the restaurant at least twice a day, I advise everyone who comes to Amsterdam to taste the food in this restaurant,"
29,San Thomas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Horrendous service. Food was alright. The single waiter was more concerned with joking with tables of women than serving the rest of the restaurant.
30,San Thomas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good restaurant. Good argientinian steakhouse with really good meat .
Cozy interior with an South american ""feel"" to it."
31,San Thomas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the special, Bisteca (steak and chips) for a very respectable €11 which includes peppercorn sauce. Service was very quick and had a great seat for all 4 of us facing the TV for the football. Friendly waiters too."
32,San Thomas, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Good food but service quality bad. Long time. Wrong drinks brought. Incorrect bill!!
33,San Thomas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had an amazing dinner with my family, all the staff were amazing and a big thanks to Giovanni for the excellent service."
