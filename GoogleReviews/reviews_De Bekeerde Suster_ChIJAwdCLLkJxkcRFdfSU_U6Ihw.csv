0,De Bekeerde Suster, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"I really like their beers! Can definitely recommend going here for the beer. The food wasn't my favourite, it was tasty but not great and portion size a bit small for the prize."
1,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic staff.. super friendly and helpful, they brew their own beer.. make sure to try some of the local they brew.. it‚Äôs very good.
They have a smoking area outside overlooking the canal and the ambience and location are pretty awesome too. Highly recommended üëçüëç"
2,De Bekeerde Suster, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice authentic brewery in the heart of the red light district. Amongst all touristy places around, this is a unique brewery with nice own brewed beers and other selections as well. The mix ""plank"" or table of food was tasty as well. Recommended and fair price as well."
3,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic place with a pleasant atmosphere.

5,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice craft beer bar, with their own brewery, they had flight/sampler specials. 4 awesome beers and some amazing bottled selections from other breweries. Service was a little slow but worth the wait"
6,De Bekeerde Suster, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic location in the hustle and bustle close to the Nieuwmarkt. Great atmosphere and a perfect place to wine and dine. Or .. to beer and dine. Nice mix of small tables for two or four and at the back large tables for groups. Loved the beers and loved the place. Definately coming back for the ribs.
7,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Of the 3 home brewed beers on tap I loved the Witte Antonia. Superb beer. Ended up staying for a few hours until we got hungry and decided to have a steak. Decent size, well cooked and great value for money. Definately worth a stop."
8,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great traditional beers to go with amazing food. Everything tasted fresh and was reasonably priced. I will definitely try visiting when I am in Amsterdam.
9,De Bekeerde Suster, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I was hear about this place, so decided to visit in my journey. Service is not so good, as I expected. Waiter-woman forget about me, and even didn‚Äôt bring menu to me. So I was sitting about 7 minets, no one waiter didn‚Äôt get up to the ‚Ä¶"
10,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to have a nice meal and a good beer alongside it. The amount of food to choose from wasn't that big, but it tasted great. For simple, comforting food this is a good location to try. Also because of the great location and it's not needed to reserve your seat."
11,De Bekeerde Suster, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice place to come with a few friends, alone or with a larger group. They have good food, simple buy tasty and definitely tasty beer. De Manke Monnik is a good one. Beer tasting menu for only ‚Ç¨10-11 is a must. Event though this place is in the middle of a tourist area, this is a place where tourists can meet locals."
12,De Bekeerde Suster, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Generally a nice bar with a fabulous beer selection of which some are brewed in house. The meal options are not bad, a little over priced and typical of local fair. Toilets were unclean on this visit on this visit. I have lowered my star ‚Ä¶"
13,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Simple but Carefully prepared food, over average brewery food, good choice for lunch. I recommend chicken pita. Own beer are worth trying, go for De manke Monnik or seasonal beer. Friendly staff. If you can, go for outside tables or one internal with channel view."
14,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place, I am told it is one of the oldest micro brew pubs in Amsterdam. They have a great selection of beers and several of their own making this trip I had their monk double it was fabulous and the next day I had their house blonde. It was devine. I will be back."
15,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beer tasting menu for ‚Ç¨10-11 is a must, 4 draughts with accompanying beer mats. All four were amazing. Fries (with rosemary) and beer nuts are to die for."

19,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent craft beer. Had De Manke Monnik which was a little dark, sweet and not too bitter. Sampled Boklam which was also very good but a little bitter"

22,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This is my second visit to Amsterdam and I could not resist to go to this brewery again after 4 years. They have 3 their own beers on tap. I had 2 and enjoyed them a lot. The food is very good and well presented too for a pub. Definitely ‚Ä¶
23,De Bekeerde Suster, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very friendly staff (most of the time) and excellent decor.  The theme is applied top to bottom.  This is a dine-in brewery.

24,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"What can I say? Craft beer is the best, and here they brew their own beer and offer a lot of varieties. Don't miss it if you love a good beer!"
25,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice ambiance bar, the craft there own beer and other special beer.
The beer from the bar is "" The Manke Monnk"""
26,De Bekeerde Suster, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice to go and have a special beer, like the Manke Monnik. The food is a bit over priced, 1 stick of chicken with 4 pieces of cracker, no salad, no sides and a little bit of fries as an extra for extra money too. A bit stingy in my opinion but it becomes common it seems."
27,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very delicious food and most importantly, great locally brewed beer! Me and my friends tried the seaosnal beer from the brewy and they are very rich in flavor. Not super expensive but still good! Lovely environment and friendly staff too. Recommend it!"
28,De Bekeerde Suster, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Frosty reception and bad customer service, even by Dutch standards. Shouted at by a member of staff for walking in with an empty takeaway coffee cup. ‚Ä¶"
29,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place to grab a drink or to have diner. This place brews their own beers. It's a micro brewery and they cater for tours as well. Try some of the Dutch finger food that goes well with a locale brewed beer. Nice place to go with a group of friends.
30,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely experience with friendly staff and amazing food - would really recommend the black angus biefstuk. Medium rare cooked to perfection! Lamb chops were great too!! Would definitely come back here! Compliments to the chef!!
31,De Bekeerde Suster, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Beers are good end especially the ones that they brew in the house. Customer service is bad though and rude. I took a place in the bar and in front of me was wet and greasy from beers and I asked the waiter if he could wipe off the bar ‚Ä¶
32,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Extra. Best fries I‚Äôve ever eaten. (I travel a lot for business, I eat at restaurant 6 times a week) Really! the fries are so tasty. Burger was just perfect and home-brewed beer a must!!! De Manke Monnik is a good one."
33,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Unreally cool staff! Very tasty and comfy!
34,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Their homemade beer bread and bread butter is something you definitely should try when coming to De Bekeerde Sister to try their craft beers.
They have 4 beers they make themselves, with one of them changing every season and offer a tasting menu to try all four; besides a large selection of beers arranged by type."
35,De Bekeerde Suster, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Come here often, before the renovations I liked it a little bit more. Just a simple place where I can hang out with tourists and have a simple and affordable meal. Good and friendly staff, and caring about customers and knowing their regulars."
36,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great selection of beer! In terms of food, I recommend their bacon & cheese burger. A bit expensive, but you won't find anything significantly cheaper in the city center."
37,De Bekeerde Suster, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Ah, a wide variety of beers in what feels like a tavern from the ol' days. Ideal for groups, which many have already found out. Don't go here if you are looking to meet locals, but fear not: it is no tourist trap."

39,De Bekeerde Suster, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Beer selection is not too bad, mostly Belgian. Food was OK. Service was pretty average, but the place has a decent vibe I guess. Kinda underwhelming. All in all also quite pricey. Meh."
40,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A big, vibrant bar with a good craft beer selection. Not too far from the RLD but certainly a cut above some other bars in that area, and with more locals than tourists on my visit."
41,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great beer. Recommended
42,De Bekeerde Suster, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Fine beer. Awful, awful service. Asked for check. Waited fifteen minutes literally watching the server, who said he would bring it right to me, ring up six other people then chit chat with his co-workers. When I finally had to come up to him to ask to even be able to pay, he excused it with ""Sorry, distractions."""

44,De Bekeerde Suster, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"This is an uncharacteristically big place for Amsterdam, and you can usually find space (even for bigger groups) when every other bar is packed. Extensive beer list -- not as big as In de Wildeman, but still decent selection."
45,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was incredible. Fish & chips with mayo were really good. Beer was solid. And our server was great!
46,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Really nice tripel! Enjoyed the 3 others on a flight as well. The steak was a tenderized Angus sirloin cooked perfectly. The service was great.

The beers are very good. ‚Ä¶"
49,De Bekeerde Suster, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food took very long to bring to the table and was already cold for some of the six orders. The beer was good, but not cheap."
50,De Bekeerde Suster, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, wonderful beer menu and really helpful and happy staff. Nice tables inside or sit at the canal facing tables on the street and watch the world go by."

61,De Bekeerde Suster, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The place was empty and the food took ages to arrive. When we asked how much time was left to get the food ready, the reply was: ""I don't know, when the chef gets it ready. "" ‚Ä¶"
