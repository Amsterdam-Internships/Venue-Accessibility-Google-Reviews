0,Starbucks, 1 star ,5 months ago,Slowest Starbucks I have been to in my life.. waited over 25min for a basic coffee..and never got my coffeee‚Ä¶ one guy making drinks while another person ringing up customer after customer after customer
1,Starbucks, 3 stars ,2 months ago,"Never have brewed coffee there, maybe not many people getting it. You have to wait and once you have it, its not hot. Warm enough but def not hot enough to enjoy coffee"
2,Starbucks, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Good coffee and good place to relax. Not nice to work because of the fixed table. No lock in the toilets.
3,Starbucks, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great new Starbucks, center of Amsterdam. With the new espresso machine for better taste. Great latte‚Äôs"
4,Starbucks, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Next time,do yourselves a favour and take the product OUT of the menu the day you stop serving it and stop wasting people's time. Im talking about the Pumpkin Spice Latte which is the sole reason I ever get into  Starbucks once a year. But ‚Ä¶"

8,Starbucks, 3 stars ,6 months ago,I love starbucks and the staff is always super nice but I was very disappointed because after buying food and drinks we found out that this one in particular doesn't have a toilet.
9,Starbucks, 1 star ,a month ago,"Unfriendly service from asian girl with mask, treats people without masks like dogpoo."
10,Starbucks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very open and clean Starbucks. The place is bright and staff are friendly. So far this is my most favourite Starbucks. :)
11,Starbucks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"What can one say, great location great coffee. Just a long line and wait though as it's a busy location. They do have restrooms though."
12,Starbucks, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Probably the only Starbucks in town where you feel like a human being rather than a few ticks and a word on a plastic cup. These people care about their guests and they even speak Dutch (or at least are trying to)
13,Starbucks, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Beautiful shop with friendly staff. It's a pity that it is so expensive overseas...
14,Starbucks, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Its ok. The mocha can be better. It looked like is was under staffed.
15,Starbucks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Well deserved 4 stars. Nice place, cool design, friendly staff. Could be cleaner for my liking, also, it definitely needs more bathrooms cause the line to the one available didn‚Äôt get any smaller over 45 minutes I was drinking my coffee. ‚Ä¶"

18,Starbucks, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Dimi was very helpful I enjoy the coffee
19,Starbucks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It was alright.. just like any other Starbucks. A bit more spacious than some branches. It's best advantage is that it's close to Rokin station. Where you can sit their wait for some one to arrive or meet people there.
20,Starbucks, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Unfortunately zero passion for customer service, emploees can't even smile back ( overworked or bored to death ?), what I found very disappointing is zero gluten or dairy free options if it comes to cakes and side sweets. Come on Starbucks ‚Ä¶"
21,Starbucks, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great customer service, Hilde made one of the best frapuccinos I ever had."
22,Starbucks, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Starbucks
23,Starbucks, 3 stars ,a year ago,"This will be a good branch once the pandemic is over. Until then, the fact it's big and spacious works against it - it feels like the staff are quite far away from the customers."
