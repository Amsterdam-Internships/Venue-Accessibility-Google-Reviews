1,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Service and the dishes were wonderful !
Everything was fresh and delicious.
I recommend the “Killer Tiramisu” because it is really killer. Cheers to the lovely waitress"
2,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We pop in here often. The pastas and pizzas are great for a sidewalk cafe and a quick bite - the best in the street by far. If you’re looking for cuisine, go somewhere else. Never had a problem with service - in fact we find it superior to many restaurants in Amsterdam. It’s easy, it’s relaxed and fun for watching the crowd."
3,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,thank you for offering vegan food! the pizza and tiramisu are amazing! :)
4,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 1 star ,a week ago,"I was being left in the cold with a table with the heater spoilt. Despite the staff promised me an indoor several times, they had to fail take the initiative to move me indoor when there's empty table. I have to get the staff to move me …"
5,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"Very disappointed, food was not very good but even worse the guy at the front had us sit outside for “10 mins” while he cleared a table for us. We ordered the food and after that he let in 10 people and not us, telling us “it’s only food” …"
6,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice pizza, good prices, nice area downtown! It was our first meal in Amsterdam and it didnt disappoint! From the table next to us we could smell amazing shrimp plates!"

12,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic food. Would have been 5 stars normally but the experience was awful. We ordered our mains and were warned that there would be a 20 minute wait so we ordered starters and drinks to fill in the time. Nothing arrived. About 10 …
13,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,Very average. I had hoped for more but it's a tourist restaurant. The staff is friendly but the food is average at best. I ordered a pizza described on the menu to be spicy salami and spicy peppers. What I received was neither. It was a …
14,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice restaurant and good food. I can recommend the TAGLIATELLE FILETTO DI MANZO E TARTUFO. And try SCROPPINO for the desert, really delicious.
Nice seating and staff. And thanks for the 2 free limoncello."
15,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,Service is great and very friendly. Amazing kitchen. Location is a walk distance from main city attractions.
16,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 3 stars ,7 months ago,"We took a lunch here and it was mediocre. Not bad food, but it's far away from the real Italian food. If you're hungry give it a try, if you're, maybe it's best for you to search for anything else."
17,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 4 stars ,a year ago,"The food is delicious and the staff is friendly..
Bit pricey but it's worth"
18,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice, fair, friendly, tasty. I recommend it. Ristorante il Primo is a small, cozy restaurant with a nice, quiet atmosphere. Given the location, prices are quite fair. We had a Pizza Margherita, a Pizza Piccante, a bottle of water and one …"
19,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"FANTASTIC espresso, as it's an Italian place. You want best espresso in Amsterdam? Look no further. Lovely atmosphere, friendly neighborhood and close to tram stop. Friendly waitstaff eager to help you find something to eat. Not the …"
20,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had such a great time here, which we haven't expected. The food and the wine were great, but what we loved the best was the service and the very very kind waiter (you better give Luca a promotion or raise!). The day we went there it was …"

27,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very polite and good personal. Food was likę in Italy - fresh and tasty!
28,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 4 stars ,9 months ago,"The service can definitely be better, can be rather hard to get waiters attention to order/pay. So definitely come when you have time to spare. The food is good."
29,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 1 star ,4 months ago,"Ordered food. Waited more than 2 hours. Nothing was delivered, phone was not picked up."

31,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 3 stars ,3 months ago,Nice.. not the best Italian resturant
32,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 4 stars ,7 months ago,"You have to order wine to get tap water otherwise you have to pay for bottled water.
Great food though."
33,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Typical tourist restaurant in a high traffic area. I ordered pizza here and it was not the best. Crust was too crunchy and not enough tomato sauce. Only reason for two stars is my wife's salad was average. On another positive note, the location is prime. I would not go back."
34,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,7 months ago,Tasty pizza and kind crew ;) Worth to try if you need good Italian food in Amsterdam
35,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The meal was fine, but wasn't great. There was nothing wrong, but for the prices (€5.50 for a bottle of water) we would have liked something more. Both of us had pasta, maybe the pizzas are better. I'll assume there are better Italian places around Amsterdam."
36,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,We came across this little restaurant on our last night in Amsterdam and are so happy we did.  I loved the wonderful salad I had with warm goat cheese an honey as well as my delicious Spaghetti Carbonnera. My husband enjoyed his lasagne as …
37,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The dining room was tiny and there was a wait for a table (about 20 minutes) right at dinner time on a Friday but the food was absolutely amazing. The carbonara was fantastic, and their fresh mozzarella on the bruschetta platter was the best I've ever tasted. Staff was busy, but very friendly."
38,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Services was good, was prepared wonderfully but lacked in flavor."
39,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best pizza and service i seen recently!
40,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food. Appetizer was great!
Risotto was very wet, not such good taste ... Was weak(?) tasting . Waiters were friendly, but not nice. She was looking away uninterested, non of them spoke …"
41,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 1 star ,3 years ago,"I’ve been so many times in that restaurant, but in the last period the quality was really bad! So many times I had lasagna that was not warm, same about the eggplants (parmigiana di melanzane)! …"
42,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves Italian cuisine! Food in this place was absolutely delicious. We were group of 4 people and all of us were surprised how tasty our food was (especially pizza Margherita). Also …
43,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty good.

I went in expecting a typical touristy Italian because of the location (near …"
44,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I give this restaurant two stars for the delicious pizza, but the waiters should be more aware of their guest. As a guest in the restaurant I had the feeling that the waiter was in a hurry and that they didn't had the time to give me service. This could have been better and for that I give this place two stars."
45,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We were 4 guests coming to the restaurant for some drinks and dessert. We made our orders to a hospitable staff, but then proceeded with a long wait. Saw two different tables getting seated, served with drinks and food, and finishing their …"
46,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, great wine, great service."
47,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Stuff was friendly but our order took over one houre to be served. Food wasn't that good: my pizza was to short in the oven and the dough was tasteless.
The rigatoni al amatriciana was below average. We wouldn't come back."
48,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Just ok, not a great experience and a bit too pricey. It was cozy but to the point where everyone was crowded so it was hard to even be waited on, keep that in mind if it’s a busy night. Our server got our drink and food order wrong and we …"
49,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,3 years ago,"the food is below average, the staff and especially the young lady is ironic, places you where she wants it, while the restaurant is almost empty ... just to have you like a showcase and look like the restaurant is full. Generally the staff …"
50,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,7 months ago,Good cuisine but it was a bit slow the service
51,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,5 years ago,Too long wait to get the food but the bigger problem was the inconsistency of the execution of the meals. We were big group and some portions were still half frozen (all components are not fresh) where others were acceptable. The athmosphere is nice in the restaurant but unfortunately the food does not match the same standard.
52,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Yesterday me and my husband ate here during lunch at this restaurant. We were very tired cause of the night before. But despite of this the waiter of this restaurant made us smile because he was very friendly and polite. Also the food was very good. Yep we’ll be back👍🏻💪🏻👏🏻
53,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here as a solo guest and the staff made me feel very welcome - very attentive without being overbearing. The food was fantastic - I would highly recommend and will definitely be coming back!! Special thanks to Luca the waiter who made my visit very enjoyable :)
54,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 1 star ,6 years ago,The absolute WORST service we have ever had. We waited 1.5 hours for our food while 3 members of the staff all sat down and ate before we were served. Not to mention multiple smoke breaks taken by our waiter. We would have been very rude …
55,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is good, but not great. We also had to wait quite some time for our dish (around 40min). It's always possible to forget a customer/dish, but multiple waiters walked past us and didn't say anything nor apologized for the mistake."
56,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great place with quality food at great value. We attended as a family of 5, numerous dishes consumed and all excellent. Highly recommended."
57,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Actually, they have pizza, wine, pasta and dessert. Not sure what the other review was talking about.
Way better than what we even ate while in Rome! Calamari and Gorgonzola lasagna to die for. Plus their kitchen is open until 11 unlike many other Amsterdam locations."
58,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly and fast staff. Food is good and not pricy. The area where this restaurant is located is great. Many restaurants and bars in the same street. So in case you can't find something to eat you just go to the next restaurant ;-)
59,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was very nice and the waiters were very friendly but the timings were pretty bad in general, had to wait a lot to get the menus and had to wait again a lot to order. …"
60,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice place. The food and the service was good.
61,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,6 years ago,We enjoyed a nice dinner here! Lasagna was amazing. The pizzas are good but oily. Good service. A little pricy but you get better food than other lower priced restaurants in the area.
62,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is a definite recommend. Great selecsele of authentic italIta food and wines. Whether you want a quick pizza or handmade pasta. They are also open for lunch which is a plus. …
63,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 1 star ,4 years ago,"Ok if it was a regular lunch place but a bit overpriced for a restaurant. Food was not particular good, would have gotten better food for 8 euro at a Swedish lunch restaurant. Do they pay people go get five start reviews? Cannot understand …"
64,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good Italian restaurant, friendly service and nice area."
65,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow. Speechless. We ordered the caprese salad as entre (generous with cheese, but more mixed leaves than basil), for main we had a special truffle tagliatelle which they replaced tenderloin with mushrooms for us, literally cooked in …"
66,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,3 months ago,Mucas Gracies - what a wonderful place
67,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Very nice meal, reasonable prices and good service!"

69,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ordered lasagna. The taste was good but it felt more than 1 day old and was overcooked. You can find a better lasagna for 12.50
70,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved the Lasagna so much I was actually regretting leaving Amsterdam the next day, so I couldn't go back for another one. Best lasagna I ate in my life and I live right next to italy!"
71,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great food, very friendly waiter"
72,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Not impressed. The calimari was expensive 16.5 Eur and dry, no dip, not much taste. The rest seemed to be low quality food in general compared to the price... tourist trap to be honest."

76,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 4 stars ,5 months ago,The pizzas were nice!
77,"Ristorante ""Il Primo""", 1 star ,5 years ago,"Avoid this restaurant, even if you're starving and there's no place else to eat. It's a tourist trap with horrible food and terrible service. After waiting for more than a hour, we got cold food, made of cheap ingredients and covered with oil (which wasn't even olive oil). Really, don't go there by any means!"
