0,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Trying to find a lively bar with nice cocktails and good vibe/music: there comes Sous! Few cocktail options but the ones we selected were delicious! The crowd was exactly as I could wish for; late twenties and above. Upbeat music with some oldies in between. This can be the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù bar in town when I visit Amsterdam again ‚ò∫Ô∏è
1,Sous Bar Bistro, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Great location, cozy restaurant and good service. Wines were good. I felt a bit let down by the food though. All small plates but not very memorable. Nice for a casual dinner but for what we paid, I did expect a bit better."
2,Sous Bar Bistro, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"The place is very cute, and the food is good. I‚Äôm putting only 4 stars for high prices for each dish (it function as tapas size portions)."
3,Sous Bar Bistro, 1 star ,4 months ago,"What can I say.. When I arrived in the bar and I was waiting to see if they had a table for 3, the waiter didn‚Äôt even bother to come to me, he just waved at me saying no. There were some tables available, maybe reserved but still, you can tell the customer and not just wave. I‚Äôll never come back and therefore I won‚Äôt recommend."
4,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The concept is to serve small portions, so you can order more. A little bit expensive, but it it worth it! The food was very delicious and the staff was friendly. Recommend!"
5,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favorite eats in Amsterdam on our visit. I had this delicious pizza and my girlfriend had the panini. My goodness. And it was our FIRST meal...set a high bar. Great tunes, too, if I remember correctly."
6,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, friendly staff, small creative plates, good wines. All there :)"
7,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice little find in the Nine Streets district. Cooking by real Italian chefs is imaginative and very tasty. Of course based on the trendy sharing concept. Food came quickly on a relatively quiet Wednesday night. Pizetta (small pizza) ‚Ä¶
8,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice food (pizza is really good). Also a cozy place for dining or a drink. The portion is a bit smaller but good for me.
9,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favorite bistro, bar, hangout.

Both with friends or business it's always a pleasure to enjoy great drinks, food ‚Ä¶"
10,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great restaurant/bar with awesome ""tapas"" style dishes that are delicious. Good beer, nice selection of wine, and cool cocktails. Ravioli with pumpkin is amazing, saltin boca is delicious and pizza is really nice. The vibe is really hype"
11,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Where often service in Amsterdam isn't always top notch uptown, this place has super friendly staff, likes to have a little chat with you. The girl at the door was very welcoming and even when it was busier when we left, she still took the ‚Ä¶"

14,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very friendly and easy-going staff. Music is not too loud. Free Wifi. Love the covered courtyard at the back with skylight. Sandwich was so beautiful that I didn‚Äôt want to eat it!
15,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic. We were lucky enough to discover this place on their opening night a few weeks ago. We were looking for a place to eat and enjoyed great food in a lovely atmosphere. The menu is interesting and varied and the quality was excellent.
16,Sous Bar Bistro, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Overall a positive experience - good ravioli (if a bit watery) a nice fresh buratta and an a-bit-to-greasy melanzana (aubergine). Good wine selection, average desert (tiramisu - the sponge was rock hard). But a nice atmosphere and we had a great time."
17,Sous Bar Bistro, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent. Great food, good atmosphere. Excellent service. Ribs, monkfish, eggplant, wine and chocolate brownie. They have only been open a week and ne of the best meals we have had in Europe.
Thank you Sous !!!"
18,Sous Bar Bistro, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Attractive ambience and interesting selection of food lured me in. However, staff member was very unpleasant and downright rude. Simply unprofessional. Especially in a touristic place like Amsterdam more social sensitivity can be expected."
