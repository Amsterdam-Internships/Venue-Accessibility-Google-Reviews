0,Trakteren, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We bought speciality coffee beans here a couple of times and they were the best!! We tried the same type of beans in other cafes in Amsterdam but it's not the same quality. Trakteren has the best in Amsterdam. We bought their Geisha coffee beans (which is very hard to gind) and the coffee made from these beans is fabulous.
1,Trakteren, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best place for specialty coffee in Amsterdam. Experts in aeropress, espresso & latte art. No nonsense and lots of knowledge what they (the 2 very personal owners Erik & Edward) love to share with you or teach you. Big variety in Single Origen chocolate (also vegan!) and (matcha) tea. Even good decaf and vegan milk!! üíö"
2,Trakteren, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"For sure one of the best coffee places in Amsterdam. No fancy stuff, but just the kind of coffee you're looking for! Quality is always good, and the guys are always relaxed"
3,Trakteren, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Just had a double espresso , this place hidden gem ! The guys are both dutch aeropress champs ! Friendly service delicious coffe !"
4,Trakteren, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A true coffee lovers place! Very friendly staff, lots of (delicious) vegan cake and every kind of coffee method can be found here. The interior looks a bit messy/chaotic though... could be a bit more space efficient. But would definitely go back for a coffee & cake here!"
5,Trakteren, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I don't drink coffee but their collection of tea is great. My favorite is the Red Pink tea. I hear their varieties of coffee are really good, as well. Top it all off with very knowledgeable and friendly service and you have a definite 5-star review in my book."
6,Trakteren, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place to get your coffee, tea and other supplies. Attentive staff with a lot of expertise. The place to get your caffeine fix (and wine talk with Ed ;-))"

10,Trakteren, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really my favorite coffee shop in all of Amsterdam. This place is not about pomp but pure amazing coffee. Always really interesting natural coffees, hard to find single origins from around the world. Lots of small batch roasts. The owners ‚Ä¶"
11,Trakteren, 5 stars ,a month ago,Thank you for keeping it up all those years guys! Truly appreciated
12,Trakteren, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious coffee, service is excellent, it‚Äôs a great little discovery!"
13,Trakteren, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's my favourite coffee place.
Bear in mind, they are in a corridor shaped place, a bit dark,  And the terrace is very tiny. Not ideal for a warm sunny day. Any other day is perfect thought. They are really nice and make good coffee."
14,Trakteren, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely local place with owners, who is always there. The coffee is top, also hot chocolate for my kids. Try their gluten free cookie and sugar-free candies! Also, great selection of chocolates on the retail."
15,Trakteren, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent coffee, cosy place, welcoming owners. I can't manage without regular visits :)"
16,Trakteren, 1 star ,a year ago,"This used to be my favorite cafe in Amsterdam, however I am done supporting it, as they are shamefully disregarding the current corona rules and either wear their masks just over their mouths or no masks at all. Disgusting, really."
17,Trakteren, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The coffee is great and you can just tell you're stepping into a place where taste is important and the baristas know what they're doing. However, the place itself is just the opposite of cozy. If only the atmosphere of the cafe was warmer."
18,Trakteren, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's great to find a shakerato in Amsterdam. My favourite ice coffee (just espresso, ice and syrup). Nice local haunt, great cakes and pleasant atmosphere."
19,Trakteren, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Small and cozy place. Coffee is excellent.
20,Trakteren, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This Cafe offers fantastic coffee for sit or freshly ground to your taste and packaged to take away. Best of all, each time I've been, the service is superb!! The staff is both helpful and extremely knowledgeable. üëçüëç"

22,Trakteren, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The coffee is great! They have wifi and a few seats if you're in the mood to lounge. I'm giving 4 stars because the place is a bit dark, and not too pleasant to be in (unless you're hung over :)"
