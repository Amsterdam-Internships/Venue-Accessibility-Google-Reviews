0,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice Place where you can sit outside directly at the canal. We didn't have any food (don't even know if they have vegan options; vegan cake at least wasn't available), but the beer-selection was very good. If you wan't to enjoy a chilled atmosphere this is the place to be... Especially at a sunset..."
1,Caf√© Lennep, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow, my best friend in Amsterdam lives across from this lovely neighbourhood cafe. A spacious place to have a nice gin & tonic or relax next to the canal. As you enter you see a large rotisserie slowly cooking chicken accompanied by this ‚Ä¶"

3,Caf√© Lennep, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Delicious food and very nice location by the canal!
4,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great place nice service and good food. Cozy area with gorgeous terrace. The waiter finished his shift and jumped into the canal for a swim. Unforgettable! I ll visit again.

7,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for having lunch or dinner, next to a canal, in or outside. Really nice staff and good food. 5 stars!"
8,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great caf√©/bar in Amsterdam. The kimchi sandwich and the burger are super good. If you‚Äôre lucky, you can even enjoy the tables right next to the water. I love this place!"
9,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, good beef, super fun waiter on a Sunday night. Decent prices. A bit too salty, but I guess it's a good strategy to make you drink more ;)"
10,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing burguers (vegetarian options included) and salads. Near the channel so great views. ‚Ä¶
11,Caf√© Lennep, 3 stars ,a year ago,Had the veggie burger which was very tasty. Great atmosphere next to a canal. Docking 2 stars because it took an hour just to order our food after asking the waiter multiple times. I'll definitely go back again and see if that was just a fluke.
12,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing food and staff! Would highly recommend coming to this lovely cafe!
13,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very nice brown bar. They a very nice map. Service was very nice
14,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I liked the place. It is just in front of a canal which gives you nice views when you are seating outside or next to the window inside. The food is delicious and pricing is okay for Amsterdam standards. Staff is super nice and smiling all the time. Beer and wine selection is enough to make you happy. I recommend French farm chicken.
15,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Had  a small party for my birthday this weekend at Cafe Lennep. Great food, drinks and awesome hospitality. There was a lot.of laughter and cheer."
16,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great food, location, space & really friendly staff that makes you feel like home. After 1 year of covid they welcome back like you are coming back home. üòÉ"
17,Caf√© Lennep, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The first time we came here was brilliant, both the food and service. Tonight they didn't want to know us. The food was very average and the steak not cooked as we asked. A big disappointment for our last night in Amsterdam. We bought wine on the way home and enjoyed ourselves here instead."
18,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,a year ago,Beautiful location. Nice indoor and outdoor space. Good service.
19,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I recently celebrated my 34th birthday with 18 friends at Caf√© Lennep and the experience could not have been more amazing. The staff is so warm, friendly and attentive you could have been mistaken to think you were in the US. The food was ‚Ä¶"
20,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic terrace with great beer selection. Food is simple yet expertly prepared with all the right flavours. Very homey style cooking and also a lot of choice snack wise. 10/10 would recommend.
21,Caf√© Lennep, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waiter was the worst I have encountered in a long time. He spilled a drink on one of us, barely said he is sorry. Then he forgot one of our food orders so a person from the group had to wait another 15-20 min while the rest of us were ‚Ä¶"
22,Caf√© Lennep, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"As I rocked to Cafe Lennep invited by a friend, I immediately liked the place. Even in the dull of a rainy Saturday afternoon the charm of the little courtyard is obvious. Inside the place is large and not that crowded but I guess a Sunday ‚Ä¶"
23,Caf√© Lennep, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Really delicious meat join. They have a good selection of local craft beers and a fantastic menu. This might be one of the best places in Amsterdam to have a proper beef roast. The interior is styling and the atmosphere cosy. Not appropriate for large groups (10+) though as the staff lose their patience quickly.
24,Caf√© Lennep, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I've seen this place with a lot of people, but when I decided to go, it was quite empty. A pity, but anyways it was a good experience. They were able to provide  snacks after 11pm, a very important detail for keeping an active evening. The music was also very good, a touch that I completely appreciate in bars, especially when it's good."
25,Caf√© Lennep, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Our experience here on Saturday at lunchtime was pretty terrible all up. Our lunch order was completely forgotten by the waitress or the kitchen which meant we waited over an hour to eat in a place that was only 50% full. I had a chicken ‚Ä¶
26,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a couple of sunny ciders and a salad. The food was beautifully presented, cozy outdoor terrace feels. However what made the experience so great was the staff: everyone was incredibly friendly and attentive. Thank you for the üåª"
27,Caf√© Lennep, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service and atmosphere outdoors. Indoors, it's stuffy and all grilled chicken fumes. Dinner menu is one of the more expensive I've seen in Amsterdam (1.5 to 2x your average)"
28,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a great spot to sit in the sun and relax over drinks or a meal - outside of the busy tourist area, but with a large patio on the side of the canal. ‚Ä¶"
29,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cafe Lennep is great place to chill with a coffee by yourself in the afternoon, or spend an evening catching up with friends. It's atmosphere is calm and warm. There is a hipster feel with the large grill wall that they use to grill ‚Ä¶"
30,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's funny that not being a hamburger restaurant they have the best hamburger in Amsterdam. The service is always fast and kind. Love this place! Don't forget to taste the chicken too ... delicious!
31,Caf√© Lennep, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Ignoring the fact that I sat down late and they were out of almost everything, it's s great visit. Waiting staff that's quick, which says a lot in Amsterdam and very friendly. ‚Ä¶"

35,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super lekker kip! And they're very friendly and accommodating, I asked if I could take something for take away and they don't usually do that, but they were so sweet to find a way to wrap it so I could take it home. I would definitely recommend supporting this local gem!"
36,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"If you are in the neighborhood this place is worth your visit. The food was amazing from the rib eye right down to the espresso ice cream dessert  and a good assortment of beers. The staff was very friendly, with seating either inside or along the canal, you will look forward to your next visit."
37,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great outdoor terrace by the water! The lunchmenu was full of classics, including  peanut butter & jelly and other variations.  Tried the Club Sandwich which was amazing and very reasonably priced! Great attentive and fast service! Will definitely come back to try their famous Tosti Lennep with farmers cheese and kimchi!"

43,Caf√© Lennep, 3 stars ,4 years ago,It has a good spot by the canal for a sunny afternoon and being inside is also nice as it is a cosy place. The food is average but the staff is the worst thing about this place. They are either bringing someone else's order or misunderstand ‚Ä¶
44,Caf√© Lennep, 1 star ,4 years ago,I had an 8:30pm booking and was sat at a nice table on the terrace next to the canal. We were asked what we would like to drink and told that drinks may take some time. 20 mins later the drinks arrived. Just after 9pm we decided we should ‚Ä¶
45,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice and cosy place. The coffee is very good, and so is the food. On a sunny day it's perfect to sit outside with a lovely view of the canal."

51,Caf√© Lennep, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best Cafes in Amsterdam. Friendly staff,  cozy environment, good food (don't forget to try their specialty). Will visit again."
52,Caf√© Lennep, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is really good, but service is really slow! 4 people waiting tables tonight, 7 tables occupied and still you have to walk up to the bar to place an order.. at least the staff is friendly"
