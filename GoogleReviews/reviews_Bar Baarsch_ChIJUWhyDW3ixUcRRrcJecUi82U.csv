1,Bar Baarsch, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"For me all the time was a good experience. The food was tasty, maybe the service can be little faster, but because are a lot of people I can understand the timming. I really recommend this place. You can try steak, fish or other dishes in the menu. The place is full of people all the time, very enjoyable."

7,Bar Baarsch, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really good vegan options and the food was nice. I had a head of cauliflower with a pita, and it was something indian inspired I think. They also have some specialty beers on tap. The wine selection was decent. Overall, nice place for meeting friends or a date."

19,Bar Baarsch, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The place was nice and the atmosphere was good. However, the food was very average for the price. By the time the food arrived it was only slightly warm, particularly the lamb shank. It seemed like it hadn't been warmed up properly. The fish from the fish and chips was very small for a main meal."
20,Bar Baarsch, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Design and atmosphere of the place earns top points. The food selection was more light bites than suited for big meals. The sandwiches were awesome.. Especially the tuna melt and steak sandwich. The fennel soup was a hit too. Service was slow but understandable becos 2 wait staff had to deal with the whole restaurant.

24,Bar Baarsch, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Best hamburger in quite a while!!! We also liked the place a lot. The daily smoothie wasn't that good, but maybe we had bad luck that day. Still, the staff really nice. We will definitely return (and have a burger again!!! :D)"
25,Bar Baarsch, 3 stars ,5 years ago,I really want to like this place but the service is just soooooooo slow. Painfully slow. …
26,Bar Baarsch, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Always nice! Best for a beer and snack pre-dinner. The wine is terrible but that’s true in most bars around town. Good also for brunch with a menu that always has something different.
27,Bar Baarsch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice staff, good selection of beers on tap, large outdoor seating areas with some tables benefitting from heaters, and cool atmosphere inside. Only had Bitterballen and Samosas to eat, which went fine with the beer recommendations 😊"
28,Bar Baarsch, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place and nice staff.
But when the website says the kitchen is open until 10pm but the only thing you can have at 8:30pm is olives and cheese cubes, you realise not everyone has the same concept of ""Kitchen""."
29,Bar Baarsch, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The beer is cold and and the samosas are good. Everything seems fresh and up to date.  They have a charging station for phones, clean toilets and lot of space. (Workers are super friendly)"
30,Bar Baarsch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very convivial café with excellent drinks for a fair price. It's not touristy at all, and it makes for a great place for a little rest on your way through the city, or a meeting place for catching up with old friends. Visit their site for the details on pubquizzes (I think they're all in Dutch, though!)"
31,Bar Baarsch, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Unfortunately very disappointed. Quite  expensive and the food was extremely greasy (like Dory would say, just keep swimming) . On top of that, I found out how pancakes taste with a hint of smoked barbeque. I cannot recommend that. They did offer to not bill the food, so that was nice (and earns them an extra star)."

34,Bar Baarsch, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Very slow to take order, then forgot half of the order in the end. Average lunch menu too."
35,Bar Baarsch, 3 stars ,2 years ago,they have devided the place into a more dining area and a bar area. This brings the atmosphere peace. More than enough choices of food and beverages for an long evening of chatter and laughs
36,Bar Baarsch, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"(Ignore the messy top, I removed the pickles)
Very nice staff and the food was delicious, definitely worth visiting."
37,Bar Baarsch, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely little bar and restaurant. We had lunch in here. Not over priced like most places here. An the burgers were first class. Highly recommend
