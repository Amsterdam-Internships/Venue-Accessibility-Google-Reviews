0,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Gorgeous and beautiful place! They have a big choice of non-alcohol drinks and uh! the location! üòç So happy I had a chance to go there!
1,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Talk about a tucked away little gem in Flevopark. Not yet overrun by tourists as it's a bit out of the way. Please do yourself a favor and try their Weissbier.
2,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An hidden gem in Amsterdam. Cool distillery located in a park, close to a lake and in a beautiful building. Great to pass by and have a couple of beers. Only opens between 3 and 6pm so be mindful on when you plan to visit."
3,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really loved this distillery, which is built on a land that was once a water pumping station. There were around 100 varieties of local dutch junevers. THE hosts were amazing and had a great sense of humour. Great place for people looking for relaxed atmosphere that's pretty scenic and romantic."
4,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best spot to taste jenever and some beers!! Located inside Flevopark, this distillery is great to just sit back, put away your phone and enjoy the view... a nice hideaway from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam"
5,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Delicious liquors and snacks in a top location at the Flevopark.
6,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great little spot in the middle of the gardens. Lovely staff!
7,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An exceptionally good bar cum cafe. Tucked away in the heart of leafy Flevopark, this quaint little building stands alone near the water‚Äôs edge. Serving a superb array of homemade genevers, along with the expected fair, this local‚Äôs hideout ‚Ä¶"

9,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is my favourite place in Amsterdam amazing drinks and food.the park it's in is lovely to.
10,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The spot is amazing, personnel is very friendly, try cherry liquor - supertasty!"
11,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Beautiful scenery from the city terrace and delicious liquors brewed on location. Very friendly personnel.
12,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Wonderful spot in the middle of the park, not many food options on the menu though, but enough options for drinks!!"
13,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Worth a visit, if you don't like beer there's good wine and an amazing selection of  dutch gins and liquors."
14,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Felt like you had come to paradise. Beautiful calm location where you enjoy some delicious cold beer during a hot day. When in Amsterdam you got to visit this place. Well worth the trip even that it is a bit away from the center of the city. But perfect if you have rented a bike.
15,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,An array of delicious liqueurs and the best genever I've found. The tradition is to pour a completely full glass on the bar and you are obligated to take a sip before picking it up. Lovely cozy place in the middle of Flevopark.
16,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The genever is good, but the real appeal is the location. It's in the middle of a beautiful park, next to a lake, and you really have to take a bicycle to get there since it's outside the city center and the park itself is so large. You pass by some windmills on the way there, and the distillery feels so serene and secluded."
17,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,a year ago,Don't skip this place and make sure you keep an eye out for tables near the water. Jenever is a must! Locals adore this place inserted in a lovely large park.
18,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite a gem, always good to be back here once in a while.
They serve a collection of self made jenever/gin and plenty of other stuff.

20,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,5 years ago,So worth the bike ride. Excellent choice on a beautiful day. Right in the middle of a park within a wooded area overlooking a lovely pond. Fantastic beer. Great snacks. Perfect!
21,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great little place hidden away in Flevo park. The jenever brewed is up there and mega tasty. The snacks are on point as proper Dutch quality.
22,'t nieuwe diep, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Great venue, web pages needed a version in  English for me to  be better informed.  The service was good and the menu board certainly paid homage to Dutch Gin.  We were given a full description of the distillery room.  I enjoyed tasting the ‚Ä¶"

29,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Location is fantastic. Lovely place to have a late afternoon drink. Opening hours spotty at best. Do visit though. Definitely worth it!

32,'t nieuwe diep, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Beautiful placeüòç
33,'t nieuwe diep, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A bit hidden in the middle of the park. A nice place to just chill on the outside tables. Fine prices too for beer or Ginever.
