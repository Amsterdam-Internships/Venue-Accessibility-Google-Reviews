30,Pepenero, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Off the main drag. Wonâ€™t comment on the food, but will tell you that from the moment we walked in they were not friendly. Didnâ€™t have reservations and were totally fine if they didnâ€™t have availability. They were rude as hell and told us â€¦"
31,Pepenero, 1 star ,6 months ago,"I wish I could give PepeNero a good review as this used to be one of my favorite restaurants in TC. However, our group had a terrible customer service experience couple weeks ago by their head hostess (not sure of her name, she was on the â€¦"

So many things i would like to point out: â€¦"
34,Pepenero, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is amazing in their menu selection, execution, and service. If you're debating going here or Trattoria Stella's just go here - every time. We went there the other night and were pretty disappointed. We discovered Trattoria Stella's owners are from Traverse City and PepeNero's are from Sicily. It makes sense now ."
35,Pepenero, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"My husband and I had the most amazing meal at PepeNero. We had a great bottle of Syrah, a burrata appetizer, the pappardelle, and the branzino.

49,Pepenero, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Just came back awesome! (Wonderful late dinner. The squash soup was amazing. Also had the scallops. Cooked just right!)
50,Pepenero, 1 star ,6 months ago,Very rude and unaccomodating staff. They would rather turn away customers than make a simple accommodation to add a chair for an additional child to join dinner in their outdoor dining space. Do not waste your time or money at this restaurant.
51,Pepenero, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Always enjoyable! Excellent service by Noah. Loved Georgio stopping by as well. Thanks for a memorable evening!
52,Pepenero, 4 stars ,a year ago,The location was nice. The ambiance was very inviting for our occasion. We were a tad late for our reservations but they still accommodated is upon arrival. The mushroom soup was EXCELLENT! The romaine salad was definitely a tongue teaser â€¦
53,Pepenero, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Just go. It's insanely excellent and you'd be crazy to skip it. The owner is wonderful and took time to talk to us about not just our food, but his family in Italy and ours. We'll be back every time we in the area."

59,Pepenero, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Excellent food and excellent service. Very romantic atmosphere. Definitely need a reservation.
60,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Upscale dining inside the former chapel of the Asylum. Menu was limited but the available options were enough to satisfy even the pickiest of tastebuds.

63,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,FANTASTIC service and wine menu. Can't thank you all enough for making our anniversary so special. Brad is the best! Can he just be my waiter every time I go out?
64,Pepenero, 4 stars ,a year ago,Only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because of how they handled their reservations. I was not in the least bit impressed by that or the attitude of the host. We had reservations for 930p and apparently when you make a â€¦
65,Pepenero, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"So,
I said:
Hey Georgio, thank you for dinner. It was unbelievably wonderful. â€¦"
66,Pepenero, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Outstanding food, outdoor seating appropriately spaced apart. All staff friendly and masked."
67,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,Oh my gosh how amazing! And they were very serious about making sure our health and safety were a priority (as well as their own).

72,Pepenero, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Another great dining choice in TC. Have never had a bad night at Pepe Nero. Service is always excellent. Food choices are many and should keep everyone happy. Great wine selection. And I love that the chef owner visits each table during the evening.
73,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had an incredible dinner at PepeNero! Our server Dorin was knowledgeable on the menu and very personable, which made our experience one to remember.

We tried the arancini, gnocchi (on regular app menu, so more $), & special app, croquettes! All was excellent! We will go back for dinner!"
80,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Second time here.  Came back to TC, primarily to eat here, and Aragon, did not disappoint.  Meal and service were top drawer/. You can tell these people love food.  Tip, the Tiramisu looked like nothing I have ever seen before, but was every bit as delicious, and more, as any I have ever eaten.  Job well done!"
81,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Awesome service, the food was so good and authentic.  Interesting atmosphere as well.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They have a great margarita. I canâ€™t wait to go back next time Iâ€™m in Traverse City."
82,Pepenero, 1 star ,a year ago,"Horrible experience, they made my date, and I wait in the cold for a table. The prices are absurd for what is served. I ordered the pork tenderloin, when it arrived at the table, it was bland, and had a ratio of 75% fat, to 25% meat. I am disappointed, and will never return here."
83,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent overall experience. Our waitress, Kathleen, was knowledgeable, professional and friendly. Our meals were exceptionally constructed while the cocktail was crafted with great skill."
84,Pepenero, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I wanted so bad to enjoy this experience...But couldn't. We waited over an hour for our food, and to be honest, it wasn't worth the wait. Both our entrees were from the pasta section. We were starving by the time it came and decide not to â€¦"

87,Pepenero, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Service was great. The wine list is extensive and very affordable. We ordered a seafood board which was delicious. I had the Gorgonzola pasta which was the best I've ever had. The Gorgonzola is mixed with pears and it is an interesting and tasty combination. My husband got the paparadelle but he didn't think it was saucy enough.
88,Pepenero, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Fantastic meal, as always. My husband and I enjoyed our anniversary dinner immensely!"
89,Pepenero, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best Italian in Traverse City.  Profoundly better than the once excellent Stellas.  New favorite.

95,Pepenero, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible experience. We went in to enjoy a cocktail before a wedding reception that started upstairs. What a stuck up atmosphere! The food was little, expensive and overrated! Very snobby owner and wait staff! Definitely seems like they are â€¦"
96,Pepenero, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Just had drinks at the wine bar during happy hour. Great atmosphere and staff is very friendly and efficient. We will return for drinks and appetizers. The food menu looks a little too phoofy   for us. I'm sure many will like it.
97,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,"An absolute gem of a restaurant with exceptional cuisine, spectacular atmosphere of the old insane asylum and fantastic service of the chef Giorgio and desserts, courtesy of his wife, Monica."
98,Pepenero, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderful food, so reminiscent of a recent trip
to Naples. Knowledgeable and friendly service, an interesting wine list. A lovely experience that we didnâ€™t expect."
99,Pepenero, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We had a reservation for 7 people supposed to be in the lounge, at 7:00pm. As we arrived we were seated in the main dinning area, and we questioned this as our reservation was for the lounge. We said we would be happy to stay put in the â€¦"
100,Pepenero, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Solid 5/5.  Maybe not quite as good as Trattoria Stella but go to both yourself and make your own judgement.
101,Pepenero, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food. Service is always top notch. If you are able to request Noah H. do it. Have been here multiple times and am never disappointed with the food. It is a pricier restaurant but it's worth it for the service you get.

Amazing small plates, great wine, superb atmosphere, and the friendliest/most sincerely happy service Iâ€™ve seen in a long time. Clearly great management! Every bite was delicious! Weâ€™ll become frequent diners!"
103,Pepenero, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best fine dining in all of Traverse City. The other Italian place at the Village doesn't even come close. Don't miss the sea bass! And if you enjoy cocktails, the espresso martini is to die for."
104,Pepenero, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Celebrating our 35th wedding  anniversary and it couldn't have been better. From the atmosphere to the amazing food to the service this was a perfect night. Shout out to our server Noel for making the night so special for us.

109,Pepenero, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Above par food, but a highly uncomfortable dining experience. Iâ€™m not sure if it was because I was young or dressed casually, but I was not made a priority and felt very judged instead of welcomed as a paying customer. For a higher-end â€¦"

111,Pepenero, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent entrees.  We started with roasted brussel sprouts.   My bride had the scallops and I had the branzino. Both had excellent flavor.

112,Pepenero, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best Dinner Iâ€™ve ever had in all of my life! This was our first time at PÃ©pÃ© Nero and it was amazing. The chef sent us a complimentary bread with an amazing sauce with cherry tomatoes. Then we had a salad and octopus for our appetizers and â€¦
