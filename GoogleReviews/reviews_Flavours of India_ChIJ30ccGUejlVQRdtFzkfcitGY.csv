0,Flavours of India, 5 stars ,2 months ago,It‚Äôs a food truck. Good warm and tasty food. They were on time with the food. Near by there is a metro station and this place has enough parking space for vehicles. You can even find different food truck for different cuisines.
1,Flavours of India, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Having tried both the Biryani and Tikka Masala, the portions are on the slightly smaller size but compensated by exquisite flavor, 9/10 overall. They've been quick and reliably great quality. Can't wait to try more!"
2,Flavours of India, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I got hooked on Indian Food while living in UK and am always in seach of good curry.  This place did a great job with serving up some fine food.  Wish I lived closer to them as I would eat here often.
3,Flavours of India, 5 stars ,2 months ago,I only have a couple bites left in the photo. Oops. This was the paneer tikka masala. Sooo delicious! Everything I've tried here is the bomb.
4,Flavours of India, 5 stars ,6 months ago,There seriously is no Indian food east of this location. Go ahead check I'll wait. It's simple. It's local. The butter chicken is enough for two with a side of rice. ‚Ä¶
5,Flavours of India, 5 stars ,2 months ago,I ordered chicken Tikka Masala here and it was so yummy. We could smell all of the delicious aromas from this cart when we walked by and it was just irresistible. ü§§We also ordered cheese naan and mango lassi and both were really tasty. The service was friendly.

7,Flavours of India, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"This is the best Indian food I have ever eaten. I tried the Chicken tikka, raita, garlic naan, mango lassi, lamb korma, and rice. All of it is well prepared and super tasty. ‚Ä¶"

11,Flavours of India, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This food truck serves very tasty food with very generous portion size. Every curry/entry will come up with rice bowl and that should be more than enough. We tried Chana masala and kadai paneer, both are very good. All in all, I recommend this one üëå"
