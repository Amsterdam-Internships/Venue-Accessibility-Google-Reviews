The owner is so incredibly kind and friendly, really involved in the whole experience. Making sure everyone is enjoying themselves. We did the 5 course. It was all delicious. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

7,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What an interesting concept! We went there when the menu was a selection of all the best dishes from previous menus - and oh boy, was each single dish incredible! I think, the whole lunch, we mostly spoke about how all the flavors were ‚Ä¶"
8,Guts & Glory, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Food is nice and well-priced. Portions are however quite small. Staff is not very friendly and prefers to clean up the restaurant instead of helping you with you coats. Don't expect a full glass if you are ordering a extra glass of red wine with your cheese platter.
9,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Superb dinner with Chef‚Äôs ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù menu. Chapter 11 (concept changing every quarter) was Dutch cuisine which was surprisingly beautiful and tasty. Fusions of Dutch notions of food brought together as very smart and flavorful dishes! We ‚Ä¶

One of my best meals during two weeks spent in Amsterdam.
Strongly recommend ‚Ä¶"
13,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I loved the idea of the 4-course menu which you can expand with your own choose of a la carte dishes. The wines are absolutely amazing! So is the staff; proffessional and friendly. I would definatly recommend this restaurant. Don't forget to try the barbecue turbot!
14,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing restaurant from A to Z . The service is good, the room cosy and welcoming. A bit Ok on the outside but very much worth going to. ‚Ä¶"
15,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Hands down the best meal we had in Amsterdam. The rotating menu 'chapters' (different concepts, changed every three months) don't repeat, and you can tell that everything is made with loving care and an exacting eye for detail. The concept ‚Ä¶"

17,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a wonderful lunch here. The food was creative, delicious, and beautiful, and the staff was super friendly. I had the Aguachile (a ceviche) which was delicious, the turbot lunch, and the watermelon taco, which was so creative as to be fun!"
18,Guts & Glory, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I had quite the expectations for the Breda Group, but I was rather disappointed. The service was slow, the food okay, but not as original as hoped for. 3/5 stars seems right, also price/quality wise."

22,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Quality experience, incredible food and friendly staff, if you're lucky - you get to talk to the chef. (Hidden tip - come during lunchtime, much less crowded and equally delicious)."
23,Guts & Glory, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff but the food lacks quality. Some course had no taste, while some courses texture complicate the dishes. The sashimi was too hard, tonkatsu lacked seasoning although perfectly fried."
24,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had a beautiful birthday lunch here with a few friends. Staff were lovely and food was excellent. The turbot and ribeye were cooked to perfection.
25,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Super friendly staff, delicious food served by the chef himself. This month is France-themed. We came during lunch and there were tables available. Dinner was already fully booked so lunchtime seems like a good time to come."
26,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A much better place than just ""a mention"". The ""Spanish menu"" was a fantastic composition and an excellent display of the chef's creativity."
27,Guts & Glory, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The restaurant was delightful. We tried all 3 main dishes. First, the tarbot was very delicious; the meat was extremely tasty and the sauce was out of this world. The duck was amazing too. The steaks, although flavorful, could have been ‚Ä¶"

31,Guts & Glory, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very good food yet some items seem expensive (3 small pieces of cheese for 14‚Ç¨ for instance...).
32,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best food I had in town... Unassuming exterior but there is a seriously creative and competent chef lurking inside. Not expensive either.

34,Guts & Glory, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food and great service, nice attention to detail and presentation. Only reason they don't get a fifth star is vegetarian only available in 5-course rather than 6 or 7."
35,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,a year ago,We had a lovely dinner at restaurant GUTS. Despite having an early dinner slot we were not rushed during our time in the restaurant. The staff were great; everyone was helpful and very friendly throughout. The 5 course Chef's menu had ‚Ä¶

The steak is an absolut recommendation you have to try. Thanks for this experience !"

44,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had an awesome experience at Guts. Sat at the bar and was a able to engage with the kitchen staff throughout the meal which made it more unique. The food is high quality with nice creativity without trying too hard or feeling foofy. ‚Ä¶

48,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The menu is spot on and the staff is very friendly.
Literally everything on the menu was delicious.
Great location in city center, parking available in parking garage nearby.
We had some memorable nights here and we are eager to have some more when covid is over!"
49,Guts & Glory, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Tried the lunch menu and totally left it with the chef to decide what to serve. All dishes are decently presented and tasted good, which made the whole meal an interesting and pleasant journey of exploration. Overall the meal and services worth the price of EUR45, however it will be even better if wine is included."

52,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is probably one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. My boyfriend wants a poster of the first course of the Thai menu so he can fall asleep staring at it. Spectacular food, wonderful staff, and reasonable prices. Never done a tasting menu? This is a fantastic place to start. Seriously, don't miss it."
53,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôve been to so many good restaurants in the US and Western Europe. This is one of the best meals I‚Äôve had. The pairings were spot-on, each course a work of art, excellent service. Bring an appetite and time to enjoy."
54,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Another choice made at the suggestion of Yelp reviewers. We were walking around town and stumbled upon the very chic Dylan Hotel . Walking through the courtyard , a very nice woman asked us if we wanted a tour which led to the restaurant , ‚Ä¶"
55,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We were disappointed to hear they had changed, but delighted when we found out the change was mostly in the name. Still a multi course chef's tasting menu where you get little to no information about what's about to be coming your way. ‚Ä¶"
56,Guts & Glory, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good food. Rotating cuisine type every 3 months - it was Brittany when we went. Excellent fish soup and curried mussels. Similar to our meal at their sister restaurant Breda, there was a period where we had to wait around 30 minutes ‚Ä¶"
57,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the most delicious meals I've had in Amsterdam. From start to finish every dish was amazing. The razor clam starter is an explosion of flavors that will blow your mind. ‚Ä¶

60,Guts & Glory, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice concept in a small place. Service was attentive and fast. The Thai Chapter (7 courses) had a couple of excellent dishes but the majority were just good. As an overall experience it was a good dinner at a reasonable price.

70,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Those guys know what they are doing! They manage to give you a (very) fine dinning experience without you feeling obliged to respect any futile etiquette! Just go there and enjoy top quality wine and food topped with creativity! Amazing!

72,Guts & Glory, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Wow! I've already recommended this place to a Dutch colleague of mine. Whilst not every dish was as good as the other the service was absolutely fantastic. I definitely think they need to invest in proper wine pairing with their dishes. ‚Ä¶

76,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The best meal in Amsterdam. Every month is a new tasting menu. I was lucky enough too be there for their Japanese menu. Terrific ramen and melt in your mouth fish. The desert was unbelievable. I've never had rice cream before and it blew my mind.
77,Guts & Glory, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Lunchroom U6 is no more. Now this place is named Guts &  Glory, a restaurant with an interesting concept. They cook with one animal, for six months in a row and then it's on to another animal. When we ate here they had chicken on the menu. ‚Ä¶"
78,Guts & Glory, 5 stars ,a year ago,Just as the other places of Breda is Guts amazing. It's rebellious and full of dare. The tarbot barbecued and put as a whole on the plate was just delicious and to die for. We had an marvelous lunch on the terrace in sunny Amsterdam
