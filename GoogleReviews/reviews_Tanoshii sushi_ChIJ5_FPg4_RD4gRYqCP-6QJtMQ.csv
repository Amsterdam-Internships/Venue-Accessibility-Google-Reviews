0,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Love this place. The rolls are very well thought out and executed. The nigiri is perfection. You can tell everything is super fresh and done with precision. Even the miso soup, gyoza, and shumai appetizers were great.
Definitely a solid choice for sushi night! Added BYOB bonus"
1,Tanoshii sushi, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"My wife is a huge fan of sushi, and because of that, we are constantly trying different sushi spots around the city. We came across Tanoshii when searching to top sushi in Chicago, and decided to stop by for a Saturday dinner. ‚Ä¶"
2,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Hands down, the best tasting sushi in Chicago. Order the Mike's special - the will bring you the chef's choice rolls until you ask them to stop. Very unique and creative without being gimmicky."
3,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,a month ago,"What and incredible experience. The quality and of fish, the technique used for preparation. All 5 star. We had the sushi faucet. Sit down they serve you chefs choice untill you turn it off! It was perfect!"
4,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Bring your Miller Light to share with the staff and let the chefs craft rolls for you - similar to a tasting menu or eating at the chef's table. Don't order off the menu!
5,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,2 months ago,"This was my family‚Äôs favorite restaurant for about 10 years. I left thousands of dollars there. Never got a thank you from the owner, neither hi or good bye. Many times I have closed my eyes to the quality of service because they make ‚Ä¶"
6,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Favorite sushi for 19 years. Talent really shines . Never a bad plate. Love this place
7,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Being a fan of sushi, but a novice, I thought the main differences in sushi rolls were the freshness of the fish, the amount of rice, and the size of the roll. After visiting Tanoshii, I've come to realize a depth I never knew. We got the ‚Ä¶"
8,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Highest quality ingredients and very delicate flavor combinations plus unique touch by very talented and creative chef(s) produce dangeriously delicious and tasty dishes. Love the foods, service and atmosphere here. I only wish I live closer to come to this place more often."
9,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This is our absolute favorite sushi spot.  We never order off the menu, except for fish/chips.  It's great for a night out with my wife or the entire family."
10,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I've been a fan of Sushi Mike since he first opened his Andersonville locale. Went today first time since pandemic and glad to find him at the top of his game and the restaurant full. Do yourself a favor and don't order from the menu. ‚Ä¶
11,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This place was absolutely delicious. I got the Omakase and explained that I didn't want √†ny rice. I was served seared tuna with glass noodles, greens and a mango dressing. My homie got spicy tuna roll and a nigiri flight. Edamame for the table. Really fresh."
12,Tanoshii sushi, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"We had a reservation for a party of around 10. The size of our party, combined with a busy Friday night, may have played into our experience. ‚Ä¶"
13,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,3 months ago,Had Tuesday 7:30pm reservation. We asked for a check at 8:30pm when we were served one order of fish and chips. Host was extremely rude. I take my family there regularly. Been disappointed several times and left before but by far this was the worst service and host. May be done at this point.
14,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious sushi! Fresh tasting and truly yummy. Went here based on a recommendation and was not disappointed. Friendly, professional service and legit,serious sushi chefs. Cozy, warm ambience; also BYOB. We tried the ""fish and chips""--Japanese pizza, was so tasty. I'll be coming back!"
15,Tanoshii sushi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Tanoshii was interesting to say the least.

I opted for the Fish & Chip and did the Omakase option with a friend. ‚Ä¶"
16,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Just posting this because it‚Äôs been a few weeks since I went to Tanoshii and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about that sushi. I can‚Äôt wait to go back. Truly unique and delicious!
17,Tanoshii sushi, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Ole Sushi Mike, always the star of a vibrant conversation. The food is pretty good too. I'm kidding, the food is excellent."
18,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I was stupid enough to move to Atlanta. I miss Tanoshii with all my heart and soul. One minute I'm eating chef's choice creations so good it brings me to tears. Now I'm eating sushi from Publix so bad it brings me to tears. And I miss my best friend in the world who introduced me to this place.
19,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,a month ago,absolutely in love!! I got takeout here many times after stumbling upon this place and I came here a few times after - presentation and taste never disappoint!
20,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We came here for our 15th anniversary.  I don‚Äôt think i have been here in at least 10 years.  It was as I remembered, great.  Mike was the same, food might have been different, good times.  If you go call to sit at the sushi bar you can not make the reservation online"
21,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Best sushi ive ever eaten. Dont order off the menu, go with chefs choice. Regardless of if youre vegetarian or love fish, theyre so accomodating and make a ""vegan version"" of basically everything."
22,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,a month ago,"What a gem! Tasty sushi, comfortable atmosphere, and friendly staff. Repeat customer..."
23,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,a year ago,1st time I've been to place and didn't order from the menu the speciality rolls were amazing. Definitely in my top 3 sushi places of all time. That's saying a lot I love sushi and have probably been to over 100 places. They definitely just ‚Ä¶

Dining there is an EXPERIENCE and is meant to be enjoyed.  They house-make everything, and it's BYOB.  You can't go wrong here if you're looking for a truly delicious sushi experience."
27,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,2 years ago,So expensive. Sushi rolls are 5-6 pieces and the menu did not indicate so. I do not recommend it.
28,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Just tell what you like and what don't, made for you as Mike special good choices to choose from. Don't forget to bring your booze. Yakiniku (teriyaki beef) melts on palette."
29,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best sushi in the city. Every roll is extremely flavorful and mouthwatering! Ate them so fast I forgot to take pictures!

36,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The sushi was amazing, we had the fish chips was great."
37,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,3 months ago,We waited almost two hours to get served. Awful service.

40,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Consistently fresh and delicious!  Mike's Rolls are so unique to any place in Chicago. BYOB too!
41,Tanoshii sushi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The only way you know you're getting a really good roll, better than whole foods, Is if you do Mike's special rolls, and those will cost you market price, up to $25/roll. They were delicious. ‚Ä¶"
42,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 years ago,One of my favorite sushi places in the Chicago area! I never even look at the menu - I just order a few Mike's Special rolls and I am good to go! It's always a happy surprise! This place is BYOB and fills up QUICK! So either get their early or get your reservations in. It's very small and intimate and a great date night spot!
43,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Hands down the best Sushi in Chicago!  Sushi Mike delivers a great atmosphere with an awesome menu.  If you want the full experience I recommend sitting at the sushi bar and letting Mike do all the ordering.  Service is fantastic, BYOB, and amazing food.  10 out 10 would go again."
44,Tanoshii sushi, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I do sushi quite often and many places. It was good but not great. I thought very overpriced and very small rolls. $25 for a ""special roll"" and very small even if high grade???? The end pieces of one roll had almost a freezer burnt taste to ‚Ä¶"
45,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Sushi the way it ought to be!  One of my favorite sushi places in Chicago.  Sushi Mike is the best.  My recommendation is to come here sit at the bar and let Sushi Mike or Chris to their thing.  I would also recommending starting off with ‚Ä¶
46,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Sushi Mike is simply the best!  He is a master of his craft.  I have been there many times and he never ceases to amaze me.  Go need to order different rolls, put yourself in his hands and you won't be disappointed."
47,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is great!! Mike make sure you are being take care of!! BYOB, definitely coming back!"
48,Tanoshii sushi, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"the great reviews got me so I thought, wow this must be amazing but it was far from it. I don‚Äôt think it was a matter of an off night, it was mediocre on many levels. The go-to sushi like salmon was good, the fatty tuna, not so much and the ‚Ä¶"
49,Tanoshii sushi, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"I'm a chef and I've worked in the best places of customer service. With that being said here we go. The hostess that we first encountered appeared in personable,  the second server was nice. And we exited with warm goodbyes.  The sushi ‚Ä¶"
50,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent sushi, miso. Byob was a plus to being a bottle of wine frome home."
51,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is the absolute best sushi I have ever had in my life.  Ask for the chef selected rolls.  Its going to cost you 20-25 bucks a roll but try it.  They are awesome.  No need for soy sause or wasabi.
52,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing sushi, the best in Chicago!! Sushi Mike is absolutely the best and this place is a must if you want to have superior sushi!!"
53,Tanoshii sushi, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"My friend and I decided to eat here since it has a really high rating. I think that, for the most part, its rating is merited. The service is excellent; the wait staff was always on top of everything. I ordered the Yakisoba, which had a ‚Ä¶"
54,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Phenomenal experience. Don't even look at the menu. The best experience is the omakase. Incredibly fresh fish and creative rolls. Be sure to bring friends so you can try more plates. Will absolutely be returning.
55,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Best sushi place I have ever eaten  Order fish and chips and put your faith in Sushi Mikes hands.
56,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hands down the best Sushi experience in the city. Mike has mastered the art of flavors and fresh fish to make this dining experience one that is to be remembered!
57,Tanoshii sushi, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Sushi Mike has created some excellent rolls. Food is always fresh. Used to be really great, could use some new menu items and a physical upgrade."
58,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,4 years ago,Beware of the unique menu ordering. We ordered off the menu and got five times the food we were expecting (enough food for five people) even though there was clearly two of us. Rather than clarifying the immense amount of food or reviewing the ordered when it arrived the chefs laughed at the amount. Such a disappointment
59,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,a year ago,Moved our daughter from Kansas to Chicago and decided to try some sushi.  It took us a while to get our food but the sushi was excellent.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
60,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I've been to many sushi places in Chicago. Tanoshii is hands down the best. Had the Izakaya (chefs choice), and every selection was great. Definitely more expensive than your normal sushi place, (paid ~80 for two people), but for a special occasion, or for a sushi lover, definitely a good choice."
61,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Most terrible experience ever!!! This place is not a 5 star restaurant and they require a reservation for dinner. I came in, place almost empty and the host asked me if I had a reservation otherwise I would have to go. Definitely I'm not ‚Ä¶"
62,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I have been eating here for YEARS. Several boyfriends and a husband later, still one of my favorite sushi places to visit. I wish I could be more specific about what to order,  but I have never had one thing there which I've disliked. I ‚Ä¶"
63,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a great dinner experience. Sushi was delicious, as was salad, miso soup, teriyaki salmon, bento box. It‚Äôs BYOB which worked out nicely. Everyone there is welcoming and friendly. Will definitely return :)"
64,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very fresh!!! I got the sushi mike and was not disappointed. The flavors were some that I would normally not choose for myself but I was pleasantly surprised. Will go again for sure.
65,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible waste of money for mediocre sushi. 25$ for 1 ‚Äúunique roll‚Äù is just a scam in my opinion. There was absolutely nothing unique about it. So many sushi establishments offering the same quality as well as all you can eat plus more for the same price.
66,Tanoshii sushi, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This place was nice. The sushi was your regular old good sushi rolls and sashimi that you know and love. The service however, was impeccable. I'm not sure if it is because there wasn't a lot of people, or whatever, but we had about two servers helping us. I would go here again."
67,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Order off the menu. Tell the chef what fish you like and he will make his own creation. Dinner for two is usually about $80 if you enjoy a lot of sushi.
68,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fav sushi in Chicago! Mike‚Äôs specials are the best!
69,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"You just have to go here... just go!!!
Get the fish and chips and Mike's special...
He'll make some awesome rolls - keeping in mind your preferences.
Definitely my favorite sushi place in Chicago - hands down!"
70,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Chef Mike provided a night of great tasting with friends. One of a kind spot with lots of regulars that come out to see the chef and give their palates a roller coaster ride!
71,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Obviously, a lot of the reviewers don't know what great sushi is but they don't know any better. If you really want to experience quality authentic Japanese sushi, I suggest everyone go to Renga Te, you will regret eating sushi elsewhere as there are a lot of fake authentic sushi joints in town."
72,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Not your typical sushi joint. Go for their special. There chef menu is simply awesome and mouth watering. Your won't be able to stop eating their sushi.
73,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic sushi and fantastic service!
74,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,10 years ago,"This is, by far, the best sushi place in Chicago! Sit at the sushi bar if you can and introduce yourself to Sushi Mike...The man is a sushi God! You will not be disappointed. The sushi is made fresh to order and is spectacularly beautiful. Very highly recommended!!!"
75,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent!!  Exquisite dish!  This was my 4th visit and their quality of sushi and service were excellent every time.  Unique dish that you can't experience ...I just love it!!!
76,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent. Sushi Mike is phenomenal. Extremely fresh fish with tastes that are amazing. Would highly recommend.
77,Tanoshii sushi, 3 stars ,4 years ago,This was very disappointing. The roles we ordered off the menu were bland and uninspired. One of the roles we ordered with a modification and that request was ignored. The special mile rolls are a bit misleading. It's not that he creates ‚Ä¶
78,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,3 months ago,We waited almost two hours to get served. Awful service.
79,Tanoshii sushi, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Some of the worst sushi (if you can eve call it that) and service I've had anywhere. It's overpriced and absolutely tasteless, staff has no class. Never knew that salmon can taste so bland. Frozen tamago (sweet omelette), old salmon roe, ‚Ä¶"
80,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"This was my first time at Tanoshii and it will definitely not be my last. Probably one of the best sushi places I've been to in the city. Make sure you try Sushi Mike's Special, you won't be disappointed."
81,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The Tanoshii shrimp was excellent. The shrimp was not over cooked -- just right. It has a little hint of spicyness but not where your mouth is on fire.
82,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent. I recommend getting the Chef's special. Eat at the bar if you can. Everyone is so friendly and the 80s rock brings a fun atmosphere. So so good.
83,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Some of the best sushi we've had in Chicago. Do yourself a favor and order the omekase. Each roll is a unique and oh so fresh.
84,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Their food is amazing. I always let sushi Mike pick everything out and I've never had a not amazing experience. Best sushi period. Best. Sushi. Period.

86,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best sushi, experience, and time spent every. Don't go and take up my spot. Always get too many Mike's specials, but byob covers it."
87,Tanoshii sushi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great location, lots of menu items, very trendy. Sushi was good, not outstanding. Hot items were same way. Staff is wonderful."
88,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Adorable place for those who love good sushi and come here for tasting them. and don't pay attention on interior. We've tried 5 types of shushi and nagiri, the all were so delisiouc. And Prices are not so high"
89,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"One of my favorite places in the city. Sushi Mike doesn't make sushi, he makes sushi art. I've gotten teary eyed the food was so good. ‚Ä¶"
90,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazingly fresh!  Try the Mike's plate for an inventive change. Best fatty Tuna, it was the best nightcap to a fantastic meal."
91,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place, highly recommend the chef's choice menu."
92,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The Fish and Chips were fantastic! Mike's roll was great too. Definitely worth dropping in to try!
93,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, make sure you get Mike‚Äôs sushi special! Service was great as well."
94,Tanoshii sushi, 3 stars ,a month ago,Sushi and service is good.
95,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The best sushi ever.
96,Tanoshii sushi, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Great sushi place in the neighborhood.  They are BYOB so feel free to bring something with you.  They are open late on the weekends.  Usually very busy, but they do take reservations."
97,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great sushi place and Sushi Mike's specials are worth a try. We love the Fish and Chips appetizer.
98,Tanoshii sushi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"You go for the sushi not the ambiance, K. The best is the ""Fish and Chips,"" everything else is just sushi. It was really warm when I dined, I'm not sure if the AC was even on."
99,Tanoshii sushi, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Excellent sushi.
100,Tanoshii sushi, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Great sushi,nice atmosphere, and a little pricey"
101,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,a year ago,Always the best omakase. It's the only way to go! Don't forget to bring Mike a beer!

116,Tanoshii sushi, 5 stars ,11 years ago,"If you didn't have fun, its because you tried to order off of the menu instead of just requesting specials, and you didn't sit at the bar and get drunk with Sushi Mike.  In short, you're a bad person and your opinion is invalid anyway."

125,Tanoshii sushi, 2 stars ,4 years ago,I really wanted to like this place but it's just not very good for the price. Try Blowfish nearby instead for an awesome atmosphere and food selection.
