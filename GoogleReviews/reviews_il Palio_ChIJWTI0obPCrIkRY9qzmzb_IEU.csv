0,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 months ago,We hosted my daughter's 17th birthday party here for a handful of friends and everything was exquisite! The customized menus with her name atop were a wonderful touch and the atmosphere was perfect for her special event. Thank you to Lyle and all the staff for a lovely evening!
1,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 months ago,A very fine meal. It's been a while since I've eaten here (COVID-19). We decided to have dinner on Christmas Eve.

5,il Palio, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Had a good dinner here after arriving late to the hotel during a cross-country road trip. Enjoyed the pasta and a locally produced blueberry hard cider. We tried several of the restaurant's popular crostini, some sweet some savory, enjoyed them all. For an entree I had the Orecchiette alla Genovese made w/locally produced sausage."

10,il Palio, 2 stars ,5 months ago,We ate there this past Friday and we had the tasting menu with wine pairing. To me the experience was underwhelming. The first course was the worse I ever had in my life. The bread was burned to the core. I was not sure if this was the …

12,il Palio, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Massimo took exceptional care of my husband and me! He was polite, offered suggestions, and was a friendly person who made sure we had a good experience. The food was absolutely to die for - we ate way too much, but it was worth it!! We will definitely be returning."
13,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious eggplant pomodoro & a diverse Italian wine selection - cookie platter was amazing!!! So fresh. I didn’t love the crostini though - bread tastes charred in an unappetizing way.
14,il Palio, 1 star ,5 months ago,Thank you Keyarra for ruining my birthday. Thank you for ruining not only my birthday but also two other members of my parties 30th birthday celebration. …
15,il Palio, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Wonderful pasta and great desserts. Our waiter James (big tall guy with great humor), was absolutely amazing and has set a new bar for service. Great place for a great dressed up evening. Thanks for making it memorable."
16,il Palio, 1 star ,5 months ago,I made a reservation for dinner at 8:30 and arrived 10 minutes late. There is a 15 minute courtesy timing which we weren’t told. We drove an hour and a half with a 2 month baby. A lady at the front - Keyaarra was extremely hostile and rude …
17,il Palio, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Awesome dinner, and great service. Couple appetizers, three entrees, and three desserts, all were superb. Would definitely dine here again."
18,il Palio, 1 star ,5 months ago,We were only 2 minutes over our reservation time and they gave our table of 8 to a walk in. That’s just outrageous! You better be 5 minutes early to this spot if you have a reservation or you may just end up scrambling to find a spot last minute!! Seriously it’s just ridiculous! Never again..
19,il Palio, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Decent service.  Food is sub par.  Overall most the food needs seasoning.  The crostinos and brussel sprouts were burnt. Mashed potatoes were beaten too much.  The swordfish was decent.
20,il Palio, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Exquisite food! Fabulous service! Atmosphere perfect! Staff very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive!"
21,il Palio, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Hidden gem. The crostinis were great. Chicken liver was whipped so well it ALMOST tasted like foie gras and beef steak is just goooood. Best to get a half portion and and app. The larger portions with an app is usually too much. …
22,il Palio, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very COVID safe patio with heaters, terrific food, attentive and knowledgeable wait staff.  All employees were wearing masks appropriately.  Will visit again!"
23,il Palio, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Met friends here for dinner. The outside view of the hotel and restaurant us lovely. They have a decent dining area but the ambiance is average at best. The menu is very short. The food is scrumptious, no doubt but it is very expensive ($10 …"
24,il Palio, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We did the tasting menu of the Chef's choice and oh my gosh, I'm so glad we did. I am a picky eater and I was nervous about this, but I ate every single thing put in front of me. It was worth every penny to enjoy this amazing meal and wine. …"
25,il Palio, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Everything from the ambiance and hospitality to the unbelievably good food and wine list completely exceeded our expectations. Even with Covid safety protocols in place, the staff went above & beyond to make the dining experience personal & …"
26,il Palio, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Wonderful meal - I recommend asking the server for advice if it's your first time eating there (like we did).  Everything was amazing and they honored our request to dine outside.
27,il Palio, 5 stars ,a month ago,Our Anneversary #51.  What a great experience!  Food was wonderful.  Hotel and staff likewise !!!!
28,il Palio, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Bolognese was just a bunch of overly oily meat and boring tasting pasta, was burping it up all night after. Service was also inattentive, and got my order wrong. One additional star for my partners meal, risotto was very good. Too pricey for what you get, maybe stay away from pasta dishes?"
29,il Palio, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Although they were out of fish (busy Father's day) alternate selections were excellent. I had salad, duck, and  polenta. Service was outstanding despite the crowd."
30,il Palio, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"Overrated.
Appetizers were good but nothing out of the ordinary
My pasta with Shrimps tasted like it was made using Ragú Sauce
Service could really improve. We were treated like they didn’t want us there"
31,il Palio, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food and drink here is excellent. Unique Italian fares offered in various course selections with suggested wine pairings makes for a special experience. The atmosphere is nice and what you would expect from a 3-4 star hotel restaurant. …
32,il Palio, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Have you ever eaten at an Italian home or restaurant and left hungry? Probably not. You will here even after dropping $400.00 for 4 people. Never again.
33,il Palio, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Being from Chicago, I have high expectations. The Brussels sprouts were delicious, the calamari was excellent, gnocchi excellent. Good food, very expensive for the portion size. Ordered a warm almond cake with poached pears. Forget it. Worth maybe $5 but cost $11!  Wasn’t even warm. Maybe just skip dessert."
34,il Palio, 1 star ,a year ago,"I'm not sure his name, but the larger male bartender was inattentive and I would consider dangerous considering the pandemic. First, when we walked into the bar area we had to wave him down because he was chatting with the host at the host …"
35,il Palio, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"This place is incredible,  truly a Gem. We went for New Years Eve a few years ago, the food and wine was impeccable.  One of the best meals I've  had anywhere."
36,il Palio, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This was my first time at Il Palio and I loved it. I love bolognese sauce so I ordered the pappardelle bolognese. It was delicious. Some of the best I have had in NC. Not only was the food great, we had the kindest best servers in Gabriel and Lyle. They made us feel like family. I would definitely go back!"
37,il Palio, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We cannot say enough great things about this restaurant. My family has only done pick-up a few times, mostly during COVID-19, and the food and service are absolutely top-notch. Items that typically don’t hold up well for carry-out are still …"
38,il Palio, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very, very good experience, food was very good, service was very good. Only reason for a 4 star is that $400 for a dinner for two is - well higher than expected."
39,il Palio, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We ate at Il Palio on Valentine’s Day – ordering off their prix fixe menu. Some of the dishes were superb, e.g., oven dried tomato caprese and the tagliatelle with black truffles; others were good, but not great, e.g., bland tortellini en …"
40,il Palio, 1 star ,6 years ago,"YES, I assign ONE STAR!  Experience?  Horrible.  Rip-off!  Won't return.  Couldn't get reservations for 7 to 7:30.  Only 6:30 open.  Arrive, were seated at the bar.  Two guests arrived at 6:30, ordered drinks to join two early-arriving …"
41,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quality, high-end Italian cuisine is hard to find in the Carolinas in my opinion.  The key to great Italian food is to start with the highest quality (seasonal) ingredients and don’t screw them up by over embellishing them or overcooking …"
42,il Palio, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food was amazing! It seemed like it was a little understaffed when we were there but it had very little effect on our dinner. Great drinks too and the wait staff were very helpful in finding a wine for.my wife that fir her tastes and paired with he food.
43,il Palio, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The setting of this restaurant is beautiful but sadly, the food and service left me wanting. No specials on the Saturday night we dined. No cocktail list was given, only wine, but it was an impressive list. Aaron, our waiter did a great job …"
44,il Palio, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"GREAT food but POOR bartenders. We ate at the bar. You would think a place like this in a college town would be able to attract a good bar/wait staff. Lots of talking about work, negativity in front of the customers. No mention of specials …"
45,il Palio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The service was incredible, the servers were top notch.

The food was absolutely to die for.  We tried 3 of the pasta, the Papperdelle, …"
46,il Palio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Always love eating here.  Easily best Italian restaurant in Chapel Hill in my opinion.  The octopus, which have had on menu both as appetizer and entree over time, is amazing.  Pastas made in house and are amazing.  They also offer two sizes in most pastas.  Great deserts.  Ask for Mossimo as server."
47,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent menu, wine selection and service. We throughly enjoyed ourselves and the setting is simply beautiful. What a gem. Strongly recommend this fabulous restaurant for a fun date night with exceptional, exquisite food. The scallops, beef carpacaccio and tiramisu won me over!"
48,il Palio, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"If you want to impress someone or want to find somewhere to go for special occasions, this is it! The food is simply stunning, we've eaten here a couple of times for dinner as well as breakfast and just can't fault it. …"

53,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Iberica pork pluma is probably the best piece of meat I have ever had. Wonderful pastas and other courses, along with relaxed friendly service. Our go to special occasion spot."
54,il Palio, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"My husband and I got engaged here last April. The ambience is lovely and serene with a beautifully decorated yet under stated dining room.  Our waiter, Michael,  was courteous and respectful. He did not hover, yet our water glasses were …"
55,il Palio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I have always enjoyed the food and the genuine, friendly service at this gem tucked in the Siena, a wonderful hotel. I like the meets over the fish, and the fresh olive oil infused foccacia is simply stellar. Wines are terrific."

57,il Palio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is my new Triangle favorite!  Very authentic and top notch preparation.  Plus, what a gorgeous setting!  I would recommend this for occasions or even a random weeknight.  We can't wait to take relatives when they visit!"

59,il Palio, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place for a breakfast date. Nice classy setting. Over zealous on the service though. Had 3 people come up literally 30 secs apart multiple times asking if we were ready to order.
60,il Palio, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Engaging, fun, totally competent staff plus a killer menu and beautifully prepared food make this rather mundane venue well-worth visiting. I've eaten here a dozen or so times and always leave very happy. Somewhat expensive, but worth the price."
61,il Palio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I was here for New Year's, and I've eaten here several times, and have had a number of lunches at the bar, the interior of this place is out of this world beautiful, very very Tuscan in its beauty!!! You can't go wrong with this place! Excellent food, amazing staff, and superb atmosphere, I love it!!! 😎😎😎"
62,il Palio, 3 stars ,5 years ago,This restaurant is unpredictable. I've been when it's over the top delicious with awesome staff and I've been when the food was mediocre and horrible wait staff. I think consistency in a restaurant is the most important quality to have. Better to know what you're getting before you get there.
63,il Palio, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Amazing Italian food. The pasta is delicious and the focaccia was great.
64,il Palio, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Celebrated my birthday at Il Palio last night.....what a treat!!!  The service, food, and ambiance was top notch.  Certainly lived up to its top rating."

66,il Palio, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Otherworldly Italian and impeccable service - Mossimo and Gabriel were awesome!
67,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Might secretly be the best restaurant in Chapel Hill, undoubtedly the best Italian. The Bolognese is worth ten stars."
68,il Palio, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Seating awkward. Crostini good. Pappardelle good.  Risotto a true embarrassment—avoid.
69,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, homemade Italian restaurant. Pricy, and not an everyday thing for the avg Joe. But amazing for a nice night out or celebration."
70,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"All time best Italian restaurant outside of NYC and Italy (Rome)! Eat anything on the menu and go with what the staff recommend, ciao!"
71,il Palio, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Far away from even the most unlikely Italian cuisine ( ""panna cotta with olive oil"" just to mention the peak of fantasy but there are few others ) and it is even very expensive. Please someone call Gordon Ramsay!"
72,il Palio, 1 star ,10 years ago,We came here for a holiday party and the food was not good. The steaks were overdone and the apple dessert was worthless. The service at the tables was inconsistent and also not very good. The service at the bar was very slow and my friend was also treated very rudely.
73,il Palio, 5 stars ,9 years ago,I had a great experience here.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent.  My steak was cooked to perfection and the tiramisu was great!
74,il Palio, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Meals did not come out together and one dish had terribly undercooked pasta. Fried tomatoes were awesome though.
75,il Palio, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Their food is amazing. The best Italian food I've had and the breakfast was just as good!
76,il Palio, 1 star ,5 months ago,Not coming back again. Extremely hostile staff
