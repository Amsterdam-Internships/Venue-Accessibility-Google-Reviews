0,Smulhoek, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of the best kebab you can find in Amsterdam. Even the wrap itself is made from fresh dough. This is a take away only place. The two staff members working there are very friendly and focused.
1,Smulhoek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The best broodje doner of the city. Crunchy bread and a lot of meat...always comes with salad and sauces on the side. Really always in time...10-15-20 minutes waiting, and i order from them since 2 years with friends. Really give it a try..delicious"

3,Smulhoek, 1 star ,3 years ago,The two pizzas I ordered are simply the worst pizzas I've ever eaten in my life. This is why I'm leaving the review. The dough was absolutely disgusting. I couldn't eat more than 2 slices. Biggest waste of 20+ euro. The baqlawa also tasted gross. The order also took 65 minutes to arrive.
