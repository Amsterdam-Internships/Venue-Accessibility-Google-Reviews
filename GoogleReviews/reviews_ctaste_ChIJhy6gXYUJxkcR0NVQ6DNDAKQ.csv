1,ctaste, 5 stars ,a week ago,We saw this restaurant as we were walking into the city centre from our air BnB. Its a short walk out of the city and easily accessible by the tram service. From the outside it seems quite unassuming. Booking was very easy and we were able ‚Ä¶
2,ctaste, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Interesting experience worth trying.
Just the food seems a bit stuck in the middle. They try fine dining, but the execution is not in line with the pricing. Instead they could offer a real ‚Äòfood experience‚Äô giving you some unexpected items to taste."
3,ctaste, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"My husband and I have been to Ctaste twice. Based on the first visit, it would be 5 stars. The second visit had some hiccups but was during the COVID-19 pandemic so I think it wouldn't be fair to dock a star. Service was much slower and ‚Ä¶"
4,ctaste, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"My friend and I came to Amsterdam on holiday, we saw this through Viator and thought it would be an awesome experience. IT WAS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE! We had a ton of fun eating in the dark. The staff were awesome and the food was delicious. If I could give them 10 stars I would. I recommend everyone to try."
5,ctaste, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Everyone should try this experience. It opens the senses but most of all - increase the awareness of how people with visual impairment experience the world. The food was beyond delicious and the staff - friendly, kind and very professional. ‚Ä¶"
6,ctaste, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very special and fun experience. The friendly staff and good tasting food make for a good night out. I was a little afraid I'd still be hungry after but it was ok√©. ‚Ä¶
7,ctaste, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great experience like none other. While the total darkness can be a bit unnerving at first, it quickly becomes more relaxing and really helps you focus on the flavors! Reasonably priced and amazing staff too. Can highly recommend!"
8,ctaste, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Interesting concept, eating in the dark.  It's completely dark so you can't make out anything.   The food was some kind of potato puree with sausage and beef bits mixed with sauces.  You get starter and desserts too.  Quality of food was ‚Ä¶"
9,ctaste, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing experience; bit overwhelming but worth it. Stuff is very friendly and explains the concept very well. Food is delicious. It‚Äôs really pitch black inside, so prepare to sharpen your other senses!"
10,ctaste, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Wow! Respect for those who are blind!
All the staff is blind so it‚Äôs an incredible experience to understand how they live day to day! ‚Ä¶"
11,ctaste, 1 star ,7 months ago,If you want to have the eating in the dark experience go for the cheapest option. We went for the Royale not worth it. You can get so much better options in Amsterdam for that amount of money. It's like going to the Ice bar... ‚Ä¶

13,ctaste, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is delicious with big portion although I cannot sure what I was eating üòÖ.
Also, the waiters are so friendly. Really a special dinner in the dark."
14,ctaste, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice idea to have a meal in a full darkness. It's not possible to make the same at home. And another the best thing - to provide work place for blind people.
15,ctaste, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very very special experience, warm welcome, great service and food, and eating in the pitch black is something everyone should do. So special"
16,ctaste, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was interesting. Lots of different elements in each course. Ingredients are medicore. It could be better if one diner could choose the food for the other. So, it will still be a surprise but adjust better to one other's taste. This was ‚Ä¶"
17,ctaste, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Mind blowing experience!!! You must go to this place to have a real taste of reality. Seeing bad reviews for this place makes me think how small minded human beings can be. Go there with an open mind, great heart, close your eyes and enjoy the moment! You won‚Äôt regret it!!"
18,ctaste, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely unique experience. The waiters are very nice and clear about what is going to happen. Eating in the dark is such a nice concept to have tried at least once. I found it very relaxing after the first 10 minutes. Apart from the dark ‚Ä¶

23,ctaste, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"To dine in a complete darkness it was freaky and peculiar in the same time. Something like an extreme dinner. The food was very good, the waiter was helpful, he gave us his calm. Definitely an experience that everyone should try."
24,ctaste, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You might see the pictures and think how delicious the food looks. But well, you won't see anything here. But don't bother, the experience is amazing, plus the waiters were one of a kind (very friendly). Just enjoy the darkness while you try to discover what you ate."

33,ctaste, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Menu was very well assembled for this concept. Quite delicious and nice wines were paired with the dishes.

38,ctaste, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It's an amazing experience. Eating in complete darkness makes you appreciate your gift of sight a lot more. Also you might end up eating food that otherwise you would have never even dared to test. It is an incredible place. Food quality is ‚Ä¶

49,ctaste, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really interesting and fun experience (dinner in the dark), but you need to go open minded, wouldn't recommend if you get stressed easily or have claustrofobia. Other than that the food was great and you definitely laugh a lot."
50,ctaste, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing experience!  It's hard to describe in words.  The staff was amazing.  The food was so good.  Be ready for something you have never experienced before.  No words to describe it.
51,ctaste, 4 stars ,3 months ago,It was very interesting to dine in the dark.
52,ctaste, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Eating in complete darkness is an amazing experience. You are eating in a different way when you can't see your food. The food we had was amazing. It's something I would do again 10/10
53,ctaste, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This concept works on so many levels. You get to appreciate food more without the sense of sight, you get to emerge yourself in the world of the visually impaired (if only for a brief moment), you don‚Äôt have the stress of keeping up ‚Ä¶"
54,ctaste, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"C-taste is a must try experience. Dining in the dark was a super interesting experience, but also made me a bit anxious. With time passing, you get used to it and your other senses are more alert."
55,ctaste, 5 stars ,3 years ago,By far the best dining experience I‚Äôve had to date. Thank you for the most wonderful time and a special thank you to Jeroen and Eva for looking after us through the evening! Food was delicious especially the crackling desert. Service was spot on!

60,ctaste, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Unique experience and Eva, the waitress in the dark is awesome.
The lunch which we had was a little bit small.. I still was hungry afterwards.
But I don't know if this was our organization who planned this"
61,ctaste, 5 stars ,a year ago,Brilliant dine in the dark experience. Have done one before but the food here surpassed the last. Very friendly bunch too. A must.
62,ctaste, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The concept is great. The room was great. Went last night and it was very disorganized. We did not get what we ordered and felt disappointed having been to one in Toronto in the past and how great the concept is to ha e been let down. I hope it was a one off, but would not go back"

73,ctaste, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great concept but I had to get up and walk out. The darkness is very uncomfortable... Iike hurt my eyes to sit n darkness. I think there should be a small section that has like 1% light fo ppl like me. I wanted to experience this but had to leave...,"
74,ctaste, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good service, but the food is pretty basic and not worth the cover charge. Worth it for the experience, which was pretty unique and happy to contribute to employing people with disabilities."
75,ctaste, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a nice concept, and interesting experience for one time. But probably not for everyone. It could have been better if food was not so mediocre."
76,ctaste, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very cool experience! No pics to share as it is complete darkness the entire time. The food was very good. Very unique! Definitely recommend it!
77,ctaste, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Wonderful experience!  Really an enjoyable evening full of laughs and trying to figure out what is going on around you and in your plate. Only reason for the 4 and not 5 stars is the price.
