0,Cafe de Bazel, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Great food wow! Went for dinner and we were blown away by truly delicious food and friendly service. Steak Bearnaise was amazing, Risotto was great. Pity I didn‚Äôt have space for desert! Maybe a bit cold in the back corners but hardly noticeable."

8,Cafe de Bazel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place for lunch and the service is very good.

Think books about Amsterdam artists, coffee table photo books, etchings etc."
