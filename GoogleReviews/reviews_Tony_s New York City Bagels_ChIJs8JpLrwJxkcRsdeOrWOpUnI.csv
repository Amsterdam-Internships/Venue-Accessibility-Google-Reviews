6,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A small and nice place to be which we discover by mistake. We had tuna salad bagel and chicken bagel. Very good and nice looking. The bagels were a bit warm and soft. They also have different flavored bagels. The size is not that big so do …

9,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ambient, not too loud music. I tried the mozzarella +prosciutto and chicken avocado bagels. What a treat! The OJ is also great here. Nice staff and and main baker.
A+"
10,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great staff, nice ambience and great coffee but NO gluten free options for bagels or cakes so not coeliac friendly I’m afraid. Just saving people having to ask, and hope GF bagels will make an appearance."
11,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Super friendly staff and amazing refills!
12,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Best bagel we've had in a decade! I had the salmon cream cheese with capers and onions, and it filled a hole I never knew needed filling.

13,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious bagels and coffee !
14,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Nice and friendly stuff, only problem is, like everywhere in Holland, if you want to use a toilet, you need to purchase something (  coffee or cake etc.)."
15,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Visited here twice for breakfast during a 2 night stay in Amsterdam. On my first visit I had a poppy seed bagel with smoked salmon and cream cheese which was delicious. On my 2nd visit I had the biggest cinnamon bun I've ever had (it was …

Perfect bagels!"
22,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I love the bagels here! (To be fair, I’ve only ordered delivery and have not actually been to the restaurant). The bagels are soft and fresh. The ingredients are also very fresh and tasty. I usually get Tony’s Omelette on an Everything bagel and it is SOO good. The flavors are delicious!"
23,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My favourite bagels in Amsterdam! There are many different types of bagels to choose from. The bagels are very fresh, great quality and always delicious. Their cream cheese with chives is delicious, I really recommend it!"

25,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very happy about the service and quality of the bagels! One of the few shops that maintains its high quality of service and food from year to year. Also like the no-nonsense approach to bagels (much more pure than Bagels&Beans). 5*  & Recommended!
26,Tony's New York City Bagels, 1 star ,9 months ago,"The staff forgot our order twice after we paid, then a while after asked why we were standing around, remembered they should be making our order, and then decided they didn’t actually have the stuff to make what we ordered, then very rudely …"
27,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The bagels are great compared to other Dutch bagel places, but the best part is the service. Great staff, very eager to please the customer."

35,Tony's New York City Bagels, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"A review on the bagel alone— this is nothing like a thick, dense, chewy New York bagel. So if you’re going in thinking you’re going to get a New York bagel because of the name, think again. You’re getting an Amsterdam bagel which is a bit …"
36,Tony's New York City Bagels, 2 stars ,3 months ago,Shockingly slow service for having 4 staff behind the bar.. and not very impressive hand hygiene. Won’t be coming back.

40,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I am not a bagel fan but I love the ""everything bagel"" with avocado and ckicken allthough I always ask for an extra topping of the advocado.  The cakes are great. 4 stars..why? They are so friendly and there is always fresh water with mint …"
41,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great food, good atmosphere 🤩"
42,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love their bagels and their coffee. The staff is very friendly. The other pastries are also very nice. Chocolate chip cookie is my favourite amongst the sweets. They also have WiFi. They offer free mint and lime aromatised water.
43,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good bagels and coffee with generous portions of cream cheese. One minor gripe is the lack of well-toasted bagel knowledge, but this place is generally well worth a daily stop in for breakfast. Their front patio is also a good place to watch the world go by."
44,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very delicious bagels, nice and welcoming staff"
45,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,a year ago,Among all the other cafés in Amsterdam this one stands out for the rather excellent bagels. Available warm or cold with a variety of different breads and fillings. Seating is available outside of you can bear the ever present wind.
46,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Although the menu itself isn't very large, the bagels are quite tasty and are relatively cheap. The inside is pretty big, and the service is nice and quick. If you're in a hurry and need a quick bite or are craving a bagel, this is the place to go."
47,Tony's New York City Bagels, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Good coffee but  very simple and plain bagel tuna ...
48,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I like this place. Great selection of bagels, no shortage of cream cheese (!), staff very friendly and they open early. I've been several times and I'll be back in the future no doubt."
49,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best bagles I ate in Amsterdam. Cinnamon bun is amazing too.
Highly recommended."
50,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Prices and bagels correct. Staff and service friendly. Did not try the pastries but looks pretty good. Bagels could be more tasty in my opinion though!
51,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food & coffee. Visited multiple times on my vacation, staff were very quick. Also do excellent fresh juices would recommend banana juice."
52,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've never loved a place more than I love this place. I tried the bagels, I tried cake, I tried a drink, it was all amazing. Would definitely go again."
53,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Heaps of choice. Good bagels, lots of butter and jam. Coffee was great and service was excellent as well."
54,Tony's New York City Bagels, 3 stars ,3 years ago,330 ml of water for 2.10 was a disappointment. The bagels are small...but good. Nice atmosphere and close to the shopping streets.
55,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The closest you can get to authentic bagels in Amsterdam. I'm not saying it's amazing, it's mediocre and does not hold a candle to bagels in NYC, but it's all you've got."
56,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What a find ! Simply delicious, around 15 euro for two coffees and two bagels - Wonderful combos and lovely friendly atmosphere. Definitely recommend"

58,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing bagel shop in Amsterdam. Plenty of options. Fully customizable. Good coffee. Good service. Would recommend.
59,Tony's New York City Bagels, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Coffee and Bagel (with some topimgs) were good, but while the Coffee had a fair price, I think the bagel was a bit to expensive. ButeI will probably come back for a plain Bagel and top it myself"
60,Tony's New York City Bagels, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Perfect place for a break in the city. Large choice of well prepared coffees and pastries. Cosy place and friendly staff. Good atmosphere inside. More american style than dutch but still a very good place.
61,Tony's New York City Bagels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best cheesecake I've ever had and the staff was so cute and patient. Recommend to try their cheesecake and the bagels.
