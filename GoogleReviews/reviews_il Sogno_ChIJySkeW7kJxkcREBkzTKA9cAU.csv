2,il Sogno, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very quick and tasty margarita pizza and at 8.50 one of the most reasonably priced in Amsterdam.
3,il Sogno, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I like the concept. You can stop by for a quick coffee or a sandwich as well a full meal (they make pizza with a wood oven). ‚Ä¶
4,il Sogno, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Wow! The pizza was much better than I expected. Kind of Napolitano style but not fully professional but better than 80% other places I've been to. Staff extremely nice.

12,il Sogno, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This is unlike any other Italian restaurant. It has a casual feel due to the store and having to order from the till. There aren't many tables either. We had delicious pizza's although the tiramisu was average.
13,il Sogno, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very comfortable atmosphere with a mix of hipster and coffee shop flavour. The staff ate very welcoming and nice. They have a good selection of coffee, tea, delicious baked goods, and tasty lunch items. They are known for their pizza in the evening."

16,il Sogno, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic little italian restaurant with a special atmosphere and charm. Even though there are only 20 places at small bar-chairs, we immediately received two seats. The atmosphere is very special. It is rather a bistro than a restaurant ‚Ä¶"

23,il Sogno, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Super bad experience, after 25 min waiting at the shop they forgot to  give us the pizza that was already done and give it to us col, without and apology. Never again, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend even to my worst enemy"

25,il Sogno, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Very nice store with very nice freshly made pizzas. Quick and delicious. The dough is *chef's kiss*. Took my Italian friend there and she gave it the Italian seal of approval.
26,il Sogno, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"used to be top, careful and attentive, declining a bit in service and quality, hopefully these reviews reminds them to bring it back to its glorious start."

30,il Sogno, 1 star ,a year ago,"As a local, it's nice to have a pizza store. But then the pizzas that you receive are expensive, and burnt. And then when you ask what the queue time is they tell you 15 minutes, even though it is 45. If the incident was isolated I would've ‚Ä¶"

34,il Sogno, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice staff, good pizza. I know it‚Äôs a small place but they could have just a little more seating.

39,il Sogno, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely pizzas with thin bases, just as we like them! All food is prepared and cooked on the premises in an open kitchen so you can watch your food being made.
The establishment itself is quite rustic and has small seating areas on three ‚Ä¶"
40,il Sogno, 5 stars ,4 years ago,TASTY!!!  I ended up eating all pizzas on the menu. Super nice stuff and the espresso was  the best I had in Amsterdam.
41,il Sogno, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We ordered lasagna and vegan pizza. The vegan pizza was bland, there were barely any vegetables on there and no vegan cheese. The lasagna was burnt on the sides and generally very dry. It was also just very small (especially considering the price). The place itself also looks a lot nicer in pictures. Do not recommend."
42,il Sogno, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, cozy place & excellent service
Had a Quattro formaggi pizza & it was great"
43,il Sogno, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely pizza place with a very different concept than the usual restaurant.

49,il Sogno, 5 stars ,a year ago,The pizza did not disappoint!
50,il Sogno, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best pizza in the Netherlands! I am a frequent visitor to Italy and know really good pizza restaurants there, and Il Sogno would fit right in at the top. The chef is indeed Italian but the non-Italian staff are just as good! It's a very nice place too, though it can be difficult to find a place to sit at the busiest hours."
51,il Sogno, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very cool little restaurant that doubles as a small shop for various Italian food items and accessories. The pizza here is phenomenal, I actually think it's the best I've ever had. Certified Neapolitan oven. They play classic Italian movies ‚Ä¶"
52,il Sogno, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for a casual dinner, fresh ingredients, nice environment, they also have really good wines to takeaway!

65,il Sogno, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Very good pizza but : not possible to have a glass of wine with it (no license) and ... flies all over your dish . Spent most of my meal waving hands to make them fly away ...
66,il Sogno, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent authentic italian pizzas. Can really recommend their signature pizza.
67,il Sogno, 3 stars ,a year ago,on their website they said they have gluten free pizza but when i got there they said they can't make a gluten free pizza bc of the corona virus and that was quite disappointing.
68,il Sogno, 1 star ,2 years ago,Pizza was ok but not amazing. My main issue with this place was the ‚Äúowner‚Äù I was there today and i saw the owner of this place being very disrespectful with the delivery guy. I was close to the door so i could hear everything. It was my ‚Ä¶
69,il Sogno, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Italian!? Seriously!? Maybe I was there at the wrong time, the wrong day, the wrong waiter.... But, in those places should go some Italian Restaurant Authority and at least forbid them to use the ""Italian"" word. Food for lunch is very poor ‚Ä¶"

77,il Sogno, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Was the worst experience ever. I‚Äôve asked for a burger with beef and the guy told me that they don‚Äôt serve burgers with beef anymore only with lamb.
