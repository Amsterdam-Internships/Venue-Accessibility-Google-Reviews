0,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Wonderful location, outdoor seating right by the Amstel and if you're lucky it's a sunny day! Of course a bit of a waiting line as it's always full on good weather days but for a good reason. Coffee is good, food is good especially the ‚Ä¶"
1,De Ysbreeker, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"The place is oke, a bit overrated. Not recommend. Had drinks and dinner here with friends. Ordered 5 steaks, all of them okeish. Some staff members are unfriendly but overall they are nice. Inside looks nice, bathrooms are clean, a bit dark ‚Ä¶"

3,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Perfect place to enjoy a nice AMSTERDAM day. With a large shaded terrace that allows for you to enjoy the outdoors, but in a covered spot. Recommend eating the mussels, as they are really great here!"
4,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice and central place to
Drink or eat.
But don‚Äôt expect great food but just normal ‚Ä¶"
5,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Food quality is very good. But service definetly needs improvement, as we waited for almost an hour before being able to order. The menu doesn't make much sense, as starters and main courses are mixed (they don't have real starters, they ‚Ä¶"
6,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great spot for evening borrel, sun until late, terrace on the Amstel. Very friendly staff. Large space inside for bigger groups."
7,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had our breakfast there, it was delicious, we liked everything we ordered. The only thing I can comment on is the service. Our table outside was dusty and waiter didn‚Äôt bother himself to clean it up for us while serving."
8,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Food is good - but nothing mindblowing. Service is friendly too. House-wines are quite nice.
9,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Nice outdoor area and great for groups. However, the food is rather average, nothing to rave about."
10,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A very relaxing place next to the river that serves great quality food. The beetroot risotto is a very interesting dish that is surprisingly good. ‚Ä¶
11,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I came here for dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday and we loved it! I had the catch of the day and my wife had gnocchi, both were fresh and delicious. The view from the Amstel reviewer is stunning."
12,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"De Ysbreener is really a very nice and cosy place. The atmosphere and the music are perfect too, like the food from starter to dessert. The personal is kind and they have a tasty choice of beers. It is closing a bit late so you have time to drink a few with your friend. I can just only recommend this place!"
13,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice restaurant with jugendstil elements at the Amstel. Good food, starters were a bit to salt, otherwise no complaints."
14,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Good environment in a nicely decorated restaurant. I ordered the steak tartar, which was delicious but a bit small"
15,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"This place is really nice; the ambiance with old wood and the many cozy corners, but in summer also the great terrace in front."
16,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I didn‚Äôt even take a picture of my White Wine Risotto because I couldn‚Äôt wait to eat it. It‚Äôs a 5 star risotto ‚Äì FANTASTIC! I highly recommend it. And for dessert the Chocolate Truffle Terrine (pictured) was delicious! Staff was nice and although the service is not that fast, the place is enjoyable. I‚Äôd gladly recommend!"
17,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place to visit. Food was lovely and the outside seating was a delight. Busy and service was slow...ish, but still acceptable. Will return."
18,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Very nice and cozy! Bigger than it looks from the outside.
19,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Perfect place for working, business meeting, drinks in summer sun, diner of cup of coffee in the morning. All round nice place with good location"
20,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Brilliant local neighbourhood bar-restaurant that seems to be flying under the radar for tourists. Really well-designed space that caters for numerous social occasions including young families and remote workers. Bitterballen probably the best we had in Amsterdam! Highly recommend.
21,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent go-to-place for good food and great drinks. Staff always helpful, friendly, (just a few exceptions) and cheerful. Awesome hotspot frequently visited by locals. You can pay with credit cards."

23,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good breakfast!
Place is next to the canal. Good things a lot of locals eating there. So I was surprised that place was busy at 11 am. The dishes were tasty. If you will be passing anywhere around, you should visit it."
24,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place, good environment and service. The food is tasty, but a little expensive.
I ordered burger, it looks cheap, but it was very tasty."
25,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Celebrated my one year anniversary with my girlfriend here, we had an amazing night. The food was amazing and the service even better. Can't recommend this establishment enough."
26,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,7 months ago,We loved this restaurant and are so glad we visited. We will return every time we are in Amsterdam and highly recommend it for anyone in the area. Large outdoor terrace along tree lined street alongside the Amstel River
27,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Good selection of food, though slightly pricey. Good beers and liquor, especially their own IPA. Lots of sitting space both inside and outside. Try their burger."
28,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,a year ago,Beautiful cafe with some incredible muscles and dips for the chips! Excellent service from Hugo. Must visit!
29,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very great atmosphere, good coffee, great lunch (try the grilled cheese, great for the price üëåüèª). Most of the time plenty of space for doing some work on you laptop (plenty of wall outlets) or meeting someone."
30,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Lovely athmosphere and great food. Service was a bit slow, but was quite busy."
31,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice service and food, large selection of beers on draft. Absolutely moment terrace overlooking the Amstel to enjoy your beer and food in."
32,De Ysbreeker, 1 star ,7 months ago,"My wife and I had a brunch at De Ysbreker. We ordered a tuna salad sandwich, a croque madame, a tea and an orange juice. The older waitress, who probably was in charge of the outdoor area, was not ammused with us asking for menus inside ‚Ä¶"
33,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food with great friendly services.
Very spacious inside. If weather is good, find a table outside with Amstel view"
34,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice terrace, reasonable prices, Caesar salad was good, cappuccino as well."
35,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice experience. I ordered the Fattoush Salad: the mix of ingredients is creative, the salad itself is fresh. I also had the homemade limonade. Perfect combo for summer!"
36,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Amazing inside decoration, warm atmosphere and very good burgers :)"
37,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Nice cafe with a spacious terrace by the Amstel river. Good selection of beers from tap and bottle and tasty food. Plenty of space to sit inside as well
38,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great spot for drinks after work! Spacious terrace and gorgeous interior.
39,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Welcoming and nice people. We had a good time. Good food didn‚Äôt hurt either ahaha
40,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,a year ago,We've been coming here for years with small groups. The atmosphere and food has always been a joy ü•≥üòÄ
41,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Huge terrace! Friendly service! Amazing people watching. We have swung through here a few times now for drinks. We haven't had any food won't speak to the quality of the food. But the beer is cold, and the wine prices are reasonable.  The ‚Ä¶"
42,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"We come here on Sundays for coffee and croissants because they open earlier than the other caf√©s do. Good service. If they make a mistake they ""make it right."""
43,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Simply a must-go. Good evening vibes, lovely views over the Amstel and a great variety of drinks and food."
44,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Beautiful interior, lovely staff, interesting menu, delicious food and amazing prices!"
45,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Perfect place for a random stop and fill up your stamina on your walk across Amsterdam.
46,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A quite place to relax away from the noisy city, the restaurant has a nice terrace in front of river channel."
47,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, look to the canal, foods and drink are Ok, nice staff."
48,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best place in Amsterdam. Beautiful terrace on the Amstel River. Excellent food and great staff.
49,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Beautiful venue, nice ambiance, friendly stuff, but the food is so mediocre and overpriced. Please do not even consider ordering risotto - unless you want to eat a baby rice porridge. It's really shameful. Definitely go there for a drink, but unless you're starving, rather not eat."
50,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice lobster dish and the atmosphere of the place.
51,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great selection of food and drinks! And the atmosphere is super nice! Amazing decoration!
52,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food, excellent view. Definitely recommend it."
53,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Came here on a Saturday evening and walked in without a reservation without a problem. Good drinks and nice but limited mid-upscale menu and friendly waitstaff but missing just the final polishes. We had to ask for our table to be cleaned ‚Ä¶
54,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great atmosphere. Super attentive staff. I've never seen a team so efficient and happy to be working together. Wow!
55,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing. Incredible service from the off (not sure they had an English menu, so our waiter just played along and had fun with it.) The waiters suggestions on our drinks order was spot on. The food was brilliant all around! Who would have ‚Ä¶"
56,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Extensive, but rather uninspiring menu - you‚Äôll find plenty of crowd pleasers that would appeal to someone who doesn‚Äôt mind the usual, tried-and-true food options, but not a whole lot of exciting cuisine to try out if you‚Äôre a foodie. Great ‚Ä¶"
57,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"One of the best in town! Drinks are good, food is okay, terrace is best."
58,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I think most people come here for the large outdoor space right next to the river, which is definitely wonderful place to dine. However the service and food weren't as impressive. It's tough to get a waiters attention most of the time, but ‚Ä¶"
59,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Always buzzing. Great place for coffee or lunch either outside by the Amstel or inside.
60,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place, good service! A bit pricy but in line with the level if the place"
61,De Ysbreeker, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Beautiful building but dissapointing menu and service

67,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Excellent food and service.
68,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Real nice service even during this corona time. Food was good, not excellent but tasty and not too expensive."
69,De Ysbreeker, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Food and drinks were ok but we waited very long to get it while the place was far from full.
70,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very pleasant atmosphere, friendly staff, and good beer!"
71,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place, good service! A bit pricy but in line with the level if the place"
72,De Ysbreeker, 1 star ,a year ago,Because I heard it was previously good I gave IJsbreeker a second try. Even worse than before. How can staff be so rude? My friend who I took here got laughed at in his face for asking whether they had smoothies. Other staff slow and rude as well and quality of food is nog good.
73,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent place for a drink or dinner, or both! We popped in weary from travelling and the staff attended to our every need with a welcoming smile. The food is delicious and very well priced. Good vegetarian options too. Highly recommend!"
74,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"High quality in Amsterdam standards, yet not a tie and suit restaurant. The menu is extensive and nothing we out on the table was less than very good. Service was very good as well."
75,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice atmosphere to work or meet someone for a coffee. I've been there twice, the first time the server came every 15 min to ask if we'd like something more. The second, the server looked very reluctant to leave his spot by the bar and be bothered to take our order. All in all, an OK place, nothing special."
76,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Originally presented dishes, good location, nice vibes. ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ (out of ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨)"
77,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always lovely experience with great, fast service
The dishes are always on point and the options for vegetarian dishes are amazing. Love to go here with groups since everyone will be able to find something due ‚Ä¶"
78,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, nice atmosphere, great service."
79,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to have a drink in the evening, fun and buzzing atmosphere! Was not too impressed with the food, but for a summery evening on their terrace, or a fun night out with some friends I can deffo recommend this one!"
80,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a very nice place for a dinner slightly above average compared to what Amsterdam typically has to offer. The place is quite fancy, except for the ""new"" area in the back of the restaurant, which is quite plain (although more quiet). ‚Ä¶"
81,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,a year ago,Excellent service and good atmosphere. However food was a bit disappointing yesterday. House wine is nice and cheap tho!
82,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It's my first time here and I loved the place. It's so live and cozy. The food is amazing and the service is perfect. I will definitely come back. We tried the fatoush salad and it was so good and the best thing was the lobster with ‚Ä¶
83,De Ysbreeker, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very disappointed with service. Was sat immediately, asked what I wanted to drink (sparkling water), served that immediately... and that's it! I asked for a food menu and 10 minutes later, nothing. Looking at the previous reviews, I should have known better. If you're coming hungry (as I was) avoid this place! They could care less."
84,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, friendly staff, good food, & nice location!"
85,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food was okay however for the price I expected a little more especially for the main course. The place looks quite stylish however the staff seemed a little chaotic and our order was messed up as well even with a small selection of dishes.
86,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favorite places in Amsterdam. Especially in summer, there are one of the few places with sufficient terrace area. However when too crowded, it becomes hard to get attention, especially if you sit outside. Nice food and beers, a little more variety would be appreciated though!"
87,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good and reasonably priced food. Rib eye  steak was 18.5 euros and fresh baked cod was 20.5 euros. Service was also very good.
88,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a pretty okay grand cafe. Nice atmosphere. I wouldn't travel all the way to this place from wherever, but are you in the neighbourhood anyway? Why not. Sit at the fireplace or if the weather permits it, go for a table on the terrace. I like them for lunch. Their croque madame is nice."
89,De Ysbreeker, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My sister and I ordered the burger with fries and we both got sick with foodpoisening afterwards. That can‚Äôt be a coincidence.
The terrace is nice but the food is obviously below average and ways to ‚Ä¶"
90,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Went there as team dinner. Very crowded and food served way too late. Tripel beer was good and food seemed generally OK (ordered a big two-person seafood platter). Wouldn't visit again at peak hours. Nice atmosphere though.
91,De Ysbreeker, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Horrible food. Got a food poisoning. Don‚Äôt eat meat there. I‚Äôve ordered ribeye and it was hard to chew and meat is not tasty. Luckily didn‚Äôt finished it. Also added some extra options to our check, but luckily we noticed."
92,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great pumpkin ravioli! The rissoto is also a great choice.
93,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Definitely one of my favourite terrace for the summer in Amsterdam. Also nice and spacious inside. You have a coffee/drink or main dishes. Average service, and for food I got mixed feelings. Sometimes it was good and other it was just ok."
94,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great contemporary urban Dutch menu, very satisfying. Nice classy bar and terrace area too. Friendly staff. Easy street parking both times we went. Excellent."
95,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, great view of boats in the canal, great food. I had better risotto here than while in Paris, and the ribeye was marbled and served with a thick and rich au jous. The apple pie is a must-have, with a dollop of whipped cream as ‚Ä¶"
96,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great coffee with a great view over the Amstel river! This is an all round place to meet, work, eat, chat, read, drink, enjoy. The service is very good and the kitchen suitable to all tastes."
97,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great location, amazing building, friendly staff. Went there for breakfast and had some fantastic scrambled eggs, a divine slice of apple pie and a huuuuge bowl of granola. The only ‚Äúdownside‚Äù was the large amount of yoghurt in it."
98,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this restaurant and bar near the Amstel, Amsterdam. The bar breathes a very mondaine atmosphere and they have a great variety on drinks and food options. The staff is extremely friendly and quick to serve. One of the better places to sit outdoors and sip an ice cold beer. Next time I visit Amstersam I will try to go here again."
99,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for a drink or to get a bite to eat in Amsterdam. Reasonably priced food, snacks and drinks, with a great view outside, but also nicely decorated and spacious on the inside. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. A very ‚Ä¶"
100,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I was in town for business and therefore alone- I found a small table and the waiter asked if he could help me in a way that made me feel as if I was inconveniencing him. I was not even given a menu before he wanted to take my order. Just ‚Ä¶
101,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's bigger on the inside.

Good menu. Friendly staff. Waiter got a couple of our orders wrong. But hey, we've all had to start somewhere too, right?"
102,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is nice but not great. All dishes lacked punch and true distinguishing qualities. Service was messy, slow and forgetful. Fine for dinner with friends, but not with guests or clients."
103,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the best spots in amsterdam, especially sitting outside on the river. Good, diverse menu for food and drinks. Staff sometimes takes long, but mostly because of business. Attitude is good."
104,De Ysbreeker, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Food and drinks were ok but we waited very long to get it while the place was far from full.
105,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,5 years ago,I wanted to give this restaurant 4 stars. Very nice atmosphere and great service but both our breakfasts were a bit bland. I had the ham and cheese omelette.  Cheese was good. Nothing special about anything else.
106,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,a year ago,"A pretentious, ordinary ""grand cafe"" on hormons & botox. It wasn't always this way. There were times it was a great cafe with a concert room."
107,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing space with high ceilings and a fantastic atmosphere at night (the only time I‚Äôve been there). The service was adequate and the desserts were pretty tasty.
108,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The ultimate true cafe experience. Well balanced menu from breakfast to dinner with perfect execution. Mornings are pleasant with the sun coming through the terrace - attracting, and welcoming the newspaper readers and laptop carriers - and evenings see a beautiful sunset on the outer terrace by the Amstel. A must go and be in Amsterdam."
109,De Ysbreeker, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice spot I've visited more than once, unfortunally it can be a hit or miss.
Last visit we endured the so called and typical dutch service.
Such a shame for this place. ‚Ä¶"
110,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This came highly recommended from a Dutch local who used to be a chef. We ordered steak tartare which was supposed to come with a poached egg. It was served with a hard boiled egg and when I asked the server, he said ""Oh, no one told you, ‚Ä¶"
111,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"""Grand"" cafe with a wide and good selection of wines, of which many are served by the glass. Popular with the working crowd, so a quiet retreat during business hours and flooded with people after 17h on weekdays"
112,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Unique atmosphere and typically Amsterdam. Open from 8 am (great for take away coffee / before work chats / reading one of the multiple magazines /newspapers) to lunch & after dinner time making the place great for drinks too! The terrace ‚Ä¶
113,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Fantastic Brunch place. Try the omelette or scrambled eggs, or the burgers for lunch or dinner.
Sometimes you might have to get the staff's attention to be served, but most of them are very attentive and kind."
114,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Ooh what a lovely experience! The restaurant is beautifully located next to the river and inside it's like a grand old hotel lobby. The food was perfect and service was great too!
115,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Large outdoor seating area with views over the Amstel river. Good to enjoy a cold beer. I had a glass of Rioja from the wine list and it was quite terrible. However the manager proposed an alternative afterwards and that was quite delicious.
116,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really immersive ambience, good drinks and decent food. If you like mussels this places very fine product, however a bit overcooked (for my personal taste) but delicious."
117,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good spot for a drink and bites on the Amstel. Also great for large groups. Don‚Äôt expect the most amazing food, but solid Dutch pub style."
118,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Real nice service even during this corona time. Food was good, not excellent but tasty and not too expensive."
119,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, kind staff, good location in front of the Amstel. Food is good, but the menu and dishes don't necessarily hold the given price. Nontheless I give it a five star because I like this place and I am prone to return."
120,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It has a great location which makes it a fantastic place to grab a drink or coffee at their terrace. Food is rather average and service tends to be slow when they are busy.
121,De Ysbreeker, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful location but the food isn't good. It was severed lukewarm and did not taste great overall. For the price paid, I would not recommend it..."
122,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"5 stars for location, 3 for service.

This is a great place to meer for coffee or lunch. Also for business meetings. ‚Ä¶"
123,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,a year ago,Top restaurant! Great food and a good choice of drinks. Very nice terrace.
124,De Ysbreeker, 1 star ,3 years ago,Pretty bad experience.. the food does not worth the high price at all... and the shrimp soup stinks a lot.....  only the location is nice with lake view. But generally speaking it wasn‚Äôt satisfying and I surely won‚Äôt return.
125,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good for breakfast and brunch. Inside and outside sittings are available. The portions are enough big for filling the stomach. All foods are freshly cooked.
126,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We come here once a month and have the steak tartare. Its a lovely space. The outside is nice and so is the inside.
127,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for working with your laptop, friendly and dfficiant service and various dishes. Specially recommended in shiny days when the outside tables are open. My favorite working location in Amsterdam"
128,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great during a sunny summer day where you can sit outside! The menu is basic but well delivered.
129,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Superb location in front of the Amstel river. Very large choice of different foods, drinks, snacks with a lot of quality items. Ideal for dinners, lunches, social drinks etc.. its an all in one place."
130,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A brilliant restaurant whatever the weather! Perfect on a sunny summer afternoon, super on a cold wintry night. Food and service were both excellent. An Amsterdam favourite."
131,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Location Location Location! and delicious food of course. Try the geitenkaas salad, truly delicious, and their croque madame ‚ô• Food quality is totally worth the price (which is on average for Amsterdam standards)"
132,De Ysbreeker, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice venue, ok food. Clearly temps for summer as waiting staff. Half the order forgotten and long waiting times for dinner as they forgot to ask for service."
133,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place for a coffee/breakfast. A little on the pricey side, but food, drinks and atmosphere good. Service a little slow..."
134,De Ysbreeker, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Location and vibe you will find hard to find in other locations in the city. The starters were amazing, hamburgers a bit less"
135,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great location.  Friendly service with a simple but varied menu.  Everything is well presented and tastes great
136,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The Ysbreeker is a affordable fancy place for a proper lunch or dinner.
Perfect for a date!
The cheesecake is beyond delicious üòã"
137,De Ysbreeker, 1 star ,6 months ago,The portions are smaller and the menu is comparatively expensive.
138,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Best terrace in the somer with Amstel view. In the winter light only in front room. Free wifi, good eggs Benedict, friendly service. Depending on day/time ideal for family or work."
139,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place for dinner. Dined solo, had a good meal.  Service was friendly and attentive."
140,De Ysbreeker, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"one of my fav places for lunch, nice big french menu. I especially love the fact the have a full dessert menu during the day also!"
141,De Ysbreeker, 1 star ,2 years ago,"- real bad service: not attentive & not helpful
- ice cold red vine for more than 40‚Ç¨
- steaks ordered as medium rare came as well done
= we and our guests were very disappionted"
