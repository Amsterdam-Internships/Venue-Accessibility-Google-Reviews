2,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Good food and service. Despite being busy (they was no empty table left) food got quickly to our table. When found out we'd arrive a few minutes late we called and they kept our table for us. Also very good eye for customer, offering to ‚Ä¶"

5,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,a month ago,"One of my favorite places to celebrate something! Always make a reservation even if it‚Äôs for the same day, because it gets packed very quickly. They accommodate you bringing in cakes, etc. So it‚Äôs great for events. No, it‚Äôs not super ‚Ä¶"
6,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,7 months ago,"The food is decent, nothing's special. There is lack of house sauces. This is not authentic Korean BBQ, there are also some Chinese and Japanese food.
The attitude of one of the waitress was unacceptable. I visited on Friday August ‚Ä¶"
7,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Do not get the sushi.
But get the Korean dishes. ‚Ä¶"

10,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious food, maybe a little bit expensive but good experience."
11,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,a month ago,Great food! Great staff :) Drinks are a lil too overpriced though.
12,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,a year ago,"My lady and I were looking forward to this meal because she had a very good experience with this place BEFORE. She was very excited to show me this place as we both were very hungry. It was very disappointing because the meat was not fresh, ‚Ä¶"
13,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It was very good. Highly recommended the place for anyone craving for a good samgyupsal. Staff are great and food was good. Price is also reasonable, its unlimited order of different food in the menu for 2 hours. And they will serve the dessert after your done eating. Drinks are charged additional but they also have a lot of choices."
14,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing place with great food and service. It was my first time in a Korean BBQ and they helped me with everything I needed and explained everything very well.
The food was fantastic with so many different tastes.
A very nice experience overall."
15,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I went to the place today with my sister. The staff is very friendly and attentive. They come by often and saw when the bbq-paper must be replaced. ‚Ä¶
16,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A four star rating is awarded to this establishment. A reservation is required however, we were lucky enough to wait 15 minutes for a table of party who never showed up. Upon being seated you are bombarded with the restaurants policies, ‚Ä¶"
17,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Portions were adequate and the concept was lovely. However, too crowded in such a small space, the waiter dropped the plates two times on the table (was not nice), was too noisy (I couldn't hear my friend), briefly it was so hectic that we wanted to have dinner asap and go out. On the other hand, I enjoyed the food."
18,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fresh food, just make sure you're up for the grilling part if you order raw meat. You might smell from meat when you leave the place, although they do their best to ventilate. When it gets busy, make sure that you got all your requested ‚Ä¶"
19,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Decent quality food. Nice, slightly crowded but cozy atmosphere. It‚Äôs a great korean bbq experience in a popular part of Ams.
If you include drinks it becomes pricey but I think it worth the atmosphere. ‚Ä¶"
20,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"while the service was quick and everything was really easy to order, the barbecue meats were incredibly weak. the meats were quite tough and very bland. those that were meant to be marinated or at least seasoned lacked any kind of flavour ‚Ä¶"
21,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Best korean BBQ we ever had. Definitely worth the price for all you can eat!
Very friendly service in an accomodating atmosphere.
They even sang happy birthday for my gf ‚ù§Ô∏è"
22,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Korean bbq. Very friendly staff and nice selection of dishes! Decent size portions. You'll definitely leave with a full belly and satisfied. The only down side is that you'll be smelling like bbq for the rest of the evening.. I guess it adds to the memory of the great food üòâ
23,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great price and reasonably close to city centre. Haven't had much experience with Korean barbecue, so can't vouch for how authentic it is but the rounds are generous and most of the food is delicious. Thankfully, that includes the meat that ‚Ä¶"
24,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing food, lovely service and fair in price. I've loved every visit!"
25,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The service was fast, friendly and efficient. The food was delicious and there were more than enough vegan and vegetarian options. Ordering goes via a tablet. Enjoyed the evening."
26,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As I'm not a big fan of sushi, I can't judge for that part. But what I have eaten, was delicious. They have a lot of choices with the bbq, decent choice in appetizers, stews and side dishes. Only the dessert is really lacking in choice. ‚Ä¶"
27,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,a year ago,"Some of the food on the menu is not provided at the store. Meat are not so fresh, and looks different from the picture. Ordering drink is compisary and a glass of water COST FOUR EURO. After one and a half hours they'll shut your grill and expect you leave. Sad, was really looking forward for this. But sad."
28,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"The only kbbq buffet if you are stuck in amsterdam. Bbq is done via electric hot plate. The food seems to cater to Dutch taste. E.g. The miso paste is altered to a ""brown BBQ sauce"", ‚Ä¶"
29,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 days ago,"Nog very much space when you‚Äôre sitting down, but my friends and I had a great time here :)"
30,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing service, I love that they are energetic despite its very busy, but, the quality of foods weren‚Äôt good given the price. The overall sanitary condition needs to be improved seriously."
31,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,2 years ago,"What a rude waitress they have!!
She served us wrong ice creams and I told her but she threw the bowl to our table. ‚Ä¶"
32,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Good quality food, a bit expensive even though it is all you can eat, but you get good value for your money and would say it is definitely one of the best in its class in Amsterdam"
33,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Korea bbq was amazing. All you can eat. Food cooked well. Affordable and the staff were amazing
34,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Variety of choices in meat, vegetables, sushi, stir fry, stew, side dishes and drinks. Value for money. Staffs are all friendly, attentive and generous."
35,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent choice if you want to try the famous Korean bbq. Unique tastes, some familiar ones, some entirely new! Really glad we chose this place for our special occasion. Make sure you go with someone who can finish his/her food as ‚Ä¶"
36,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Overall good experience. The food was good (the ginbap was outstanding) and the staff extremely polite. However, the venue itself was dark and crowded and the grills gave off smoke that made me tear up. The price is normal for an all you can eat Koren BBQ, which are usually pricy."
37,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Good ambiance, wonderfull food and super kind and fast personel. I was here with two other friends for my birthday. We had a wonderfull evening at the restaurant."
38,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Very nice place. The staff were attentive. I love their kimchi and stew.
39,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The concept is fun. The food quality is not top, but ok. BBQ you use on the tables is really poorly made, they make you use some kind of paper to prepare the food on, which is often sticky and can never be the same as the standard BBQ or hot stone."
40,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Efficient service and friendly staff, especially Matthew, he is very attentive.

Good selection of food and ice cream"
41,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Really friendly staff, super delicious food!"

43,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"The food is ok, service is fast, I think it‚Äôs a bit over priced, but nothing to complain here because I read their menu online. However, it is not the reason I‚Äôm giving two stars here. The restaurant clearly does not respect the 1.5 meters‚Äô ‚Ä¶"
44,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice service. The food was ok, but a few dishes could be corrected. We had ,All you can eat' option so tried a lot of dishes."

47,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good foods, need a reservation 'cause it's very full. Be aware of the smell on your clothes after the diner."
48,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious food and interesting experience. Maximum 3 items per round per person (5 rounds total), for the price, the amount of food is good."
49,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"It's okay, not great, not too bad, like very other sushi annex grill all-you-can-eat thingy out there. Friendly service though. Unfortunately the same tendency as well other similar places to serve almost every grilled or fried fish with sugary sauces. Sushi is okay. Not great, not too bad."
50,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"All you can eat Korean barbecue! A lot of hot food options! (We deducted a star because each drink costs ‚Ç¨2.8 or above, while having drinks are essential for bbq)"
51,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, the meat was wonderful. Very unique experience. There was a good amount of tasty side dishes, including famous Korean kimchi! Surprisingly, very tasty. The portions are large and filling, the variety is pretty good, although I ‚Ä¶"
52,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,No matter where I go I always seem to crave KBBQ so I decided to give Miss Korea BBQ a shot. I came here after a day at the zoo with my husband and what they had to offer and they satisfied our cravings. ‚Ä¶
53,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"I love this place! It is such a fun experience to do, the food is delicious and the staff is incredibly attentive and sweet! They are definitely a reason to come back, especially in Amsterdam where proper service is often hard to find. I can highly recommend this wonderful restaurant!"
54,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"First: No tab water !....

Food is average, it's good place for chilling with friends and cook your own food. All you can eat BBQ menu is little overpriced for the quality."
55,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Pretty good, makes for a fun evening if you take some fun people with you. The food's pretty good and the service is great. For the price per person and the fun of grilling your own food I'd definitely recommend checking them out :)"
56,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff was really friendly, fast and helpful. The food was good, especially the bibimbap! Note: It gets hot inside when everyone's barbecuing."
57,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really cool concept in which you can order your choice of meat and prepare it on the bbq yourself! The already prepared dishes were good as well.
58,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place with great options and all you can eat, which you can't :)"
59,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,6 months ago,A bit overcrowded.. bbq feature doesn't really work that well and the menu is much shorter than other all you can eat restaurants. I don't think I'll be coming back.
60,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Great service! We where able to enter last minute. You order on a tablet and the food comes very quickly. A bit pricey tho 30 pp.
61,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The meats were pretty good, the service, not that much and they had sushi that was very dry. At night you only have all you can eat and in the and you will pay around 32 euros. Nice to try, but i'm not going back."
62,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"The amazing korean BBQ in Amsterdam, pleasant marinade for meat and atypical serving a dishes <3"
63,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best Korean Barbeque in Amsterdam!
Staff is really friendly and helpful.
My recommendation is the Bulgogi seasoned Beef and the Sirloin beef try it and you will love it ;-)"
64,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice place to catch up with friends while preparing your BBQ meat/seafood /veggies. And while waiting for your BBQ food, just order some Korean dishes and enjoy. My favorites to put on the BBQ are lamb, squid and bulgogi seasoned pork and my favorite dishes are Seafood pancake, Chapchae, Sweet Chicken Wings."
65,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best Service. Clicked on the dish and it was thereüòç
Very delicious Food. Good Quality!
Will be here again"
66,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Positives first: nice and helpful service. Cool concept and setup, nice interior and location.
Now negatives: food is really mediocre and therefore overpriced. Meat was low ‚Ä¶"

68,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really enjoyed my visit, lots of food and not too expensive. Service was great and quick too."

70,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Been coming to this restaurant for about 10 years now and can say it consistently has good food and service.
71,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Food is bland, westernized and mediocre. In addition, the staff will urge you to leave the restaurant 30 minutes before closing time because, and I quote, ""we want to go home."" After these and more odious comment, so did I. The only thing ‚Ä¶"
72,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"It was amazing we loved it ! We were there for lunch and everything was so nice, especially the people and the service. Thanks a lot."

74,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place with very tasty dishes. Reasonably priced. Will visit again.
75,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It was a lovely experience! the service wasn‚Äôt extremely fast but the food was very good.
The only thing that bothered me was that there were two guys next to us and they were loud eaters!"
76,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Fast and friendly service. Big range of food to try. Would definitely recommend, also for the different experience of Korean BBQ"
77,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Best Korean in ages, since ""little Korea"" in Annandale, Virginia and in Korea.
People, wrap the bulgogi meat in the lettuce leaf along with the flavorful side dishes! You're missing the full experience if you just eat it plain and the lettuce sits in the basket like an ornament."
78,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,Perfect place to try all Korean cuisine. Professional people. Would recommend to others. Would go again.
79,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Amazing experience. You get to cook your food. The quality of the food was amazing, prepare to eat a lot and have a wide variety of choices."
80,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,8 months ago,The meat was old. After baking you could see a rainbow on your meat. The cold noodle soup was disgusting. It tasted like pineapple juice from a can with some tasteless noodle inside. Way too overpriced. Stop fooling the foreigners that doesn't know bout korean dining. The service on the other hand was okay.
81,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,a month ago,this restaurant isnt even close to being called a korean cuisine...
82,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Went here today because I was craving some fat juicy meat and it was a very good choice.
Employees were very nice and helping. ‚Ä¶"
83,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I think that it is an interesting Corean restaurant. So close to the pubs in the Pijp. All you can eat.
84,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Perfect. But be aware that you will smell like BBQ the rest of the day. But worth it.
85,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Great. All inclusive mix if meat and veg BBQ
86,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Disappointing example of Korean food. The waitress (stressed, unfriendly), and Korean dish substitutes (cheapest alternatives which Dutch ppl will not notice) combines to this experience."
87,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Awesome buffet. The food is so good! Make sure to order the custard buns. They have many options for vegetarians.
88,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great experience, staff was impeccable and the food extremely well prepared and served. Would love to comeback for a 2nd time!!"
89,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food. Nice staff. You really need to reserve a table.
90,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,5 months ago,"I spent 72‚Ç¨ so that you reading this doesn‚Äôt need to. Don‚Äôt eat here, it‚Äôs awful."
91,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Their food and service was absolutely fantastic! I finally met the best naengmeyon in Europe.
92,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"If you crave for some BBQ, this is a great location!! Very friendly staff and the food is delicious üòá"
93,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Get a reservation, this place is busy! Each person gets 3 orders, over 5 rounds (it's more than you think). Drinks are mandatory. The grill is a little small, but forces you to pace yourself. I appreciated proper ventilation so that you don't smell like BBQ afterwards. The pork belly and fried chicken were fabulous!"
94,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food which tastes a lot better than other KBBQ restaurants i've been to. Staff is nice and helps keeping your BBQ clean! The food you order comes to the table fast. The restaurant looks really nice and has a cozy Korean aesthetic! Would come here more often for sure

96,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very reasonable Korean BBQ in the Heart of Amsterdam. The restaurant is quite spacious and new, even if the tables are a little small. Food is good and the prices are aligned with other all you can eat in this city. People are quite friendly. Overall a good experience!"
97,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Reservation was fine and we get our table on time.
But the quality wasn't  as expected for 30 ‚Ç¨ ...
Meat was not seasoned. Sushi was okay. The standard dishes are very small. I ate several times Korean bbq but this was not good..."
98,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You get plenty of fresh meat and fish. Unlimited rounds that you can order.

Very kind and cheerful staff too. Outstanding food! Totally worth the price, which is very average for this amount of freshness you get served."
99,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely food, fast serving. You can order 3 items per round with 5 rounds max for around ‚Ç¨30 a person.
There‚Äôs a mix of ready made dishes and raw cuts to cook on the grill yourself. Meat was well marinated and everything tasted good."
100,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best all you can eat in Amsterdam. Really love the pork belly and seaweed salad.
101,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My first experience of a DIY Korean bbq, but it was really tasty food, helpful staff, and delicious ice-cream too! Try not to over-order as you will be charged for what you don't eat, and they view it as rude, which is fair! I wouldn't ‚Ä¶"
102,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service and food! We reserved a table here and wasn't sure what to expect, we arrived, sat down and ordered and food was there very quickly even though it was relatively busy. Will be visiting here again for sure, it's great for ‚Ä¶"
103,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great and fun experience. Most of the food tastes really good. As long as as you cook it right of course. The cooked food was good and you will feel full when you leave. Had no real issues with smelly clothes after like I have seen complaints about. Maybe they have upgraded their ventilation.
104,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty decent place for an all you can eat restaurant. It's not proper Korean food but you can't really expect that for the price and concept. The BBQ meat was ok, not greatly marinated like we had hoped. The staff were also friendly but ‚Ä¶"
105,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was OK, some bits better than others (we enjoyed the pancake, the soup and a potato, seafood and veggies dish with a bitter sweet and sour sauce). The rest was OK but nothing to have your mind blown, so I would give three stars to ‚Ä¶"
106,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,You can have authentic korean bbq here if you are looking for korean cuisine. The meats and seafood very fresh.
107,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Services were great but the quality of foods are average in terms of marinaded meats and kimchi is a bit bland. This is a good place to go for when I have cravings for Korean bbq. You‚Äôre able to order 3 dishes each person per round for 5 ‚Ä¶
108,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I'm a local and went here with a friend on Friday night. The food was what you would expect for the price, and we ordered one of their better bottles of wine.

109,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good food, the place system is clever."
110,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was one of the best restaurant experiences i‚Äôve had in Amsterdam. The food was really good, the sushi was decent, there was so much variety. Atmosphere and staff were really nice. Value for money is great, I had a really good evening. I will definitely be returning!"
111,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great all you can eat Korean restaurant in Amsterdam run by Chinese owners. A great selection if dishes and meat as well ad Sushi. A place to go with friends and families and convenient wat if ordering food with a tablet. Friendly staff and quick service with a reasonable price tag.
112,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Pretty bad quality meat tbh, wouldnt recommend"
113,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Reasonable fixed price for a good selection of basic Korean dishes and BBQ ingredients. Small portions tho, so can easily order multiple rounds. Seafood pancake was great!"
114,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food quality was pretty bad... not worth the money

Won‚Äôt consider coming back"
115,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice interoirs and super fast service. Taste of the food ranges from acceptable to good, so it's really more about the communal atmosphere of all-you-can-eat grilling. The noodle (cold noodle) and stew (kimchi) dishes were pretty ‚Ä¶"
116,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,All u can eat.  So good. Best KBbQ in netherland.
117,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,AMAZING FOOD!!!! AND PRETTY MUCH UNLIMITED TOO!!! It cost around $60 USD for two people and up to 50 dishes (sides/main/dessert in 5 rounds). This was one of the best places we ate in Amsterdam and the service was quick.  We will definitely be returning.
118,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"very nice Korean BBQ experience! they have a variety of meats, poultry, fish and sea food, as well as some veggies that you can grill (I ordered some Portobello mushrooms). Lettuce leaves keep coming non stop even though the place was full ‚Ä¶"
119,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was alright. Not really well-seasoned or marinated except for the duck and lamb (which weren't Korean üòÇüòÇ). Other dishes were alright. Nothing really stood out. Plus the place needs to take better care of their hygiene. Our table was ‚Ä¶
120,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cozy restaurant with a grill build into each table. You order different kinds of food off the menu and grill it yourself. The grill is cleaned properly and the food is tasty (but I had a great chef of course). The sauces and extras are typical Korean. The staff is very kind and helpful. Great place for a first date!
121,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lots of very tasty food. more than 60 menu items. in total you choose 15 (5 rounds of 3). the duck, the lamb chops and the lamb skewer are amazing. Very good vibe in the restaurant. you cook some of your own food. oh the sushi is also revommended. come hungry and for a long time to really enjoy the place."
122,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food with a unique concept.
123,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This restaurant is pretty cute. It has a nice ambience, good lighting, great service. The way the restaurant is set up you prepare your own food on a grill set in the middle of the table. You order small dishes in multiple courses, with ‚Ä¶"
124,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Expensive but worth the experience. Go with friends, and cook yourself some awesome korean bbq. Meat ranges from beef to chicken as well a big variety of fish. The only grub is cleaning the grill after using it, but the waiters are quick (if its not busy) to help you."
125,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good value and offers a wide selection of Korean (and non-Korean) dishes. However, with it being an all-you-can-eat establishment, expect for the food quality to only be decent. In sum, Miss Korea is a great place to go to if you're hungry, but unimpressive if you want good Korean food."
126,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Service was very nice. (might be because they also remembered us from earlier visits) food was great to my tastes. Enjoyed it every time. And the self bbqing always kinda gives a good atmosphere in the group.
127,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Food was really good! The only critisism I could give that the table is maybe a bit small for 4 large people.
128,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been here few time and would recommend to go with friends/ in group. The times I've been there it's an all you can eat setting so, no a la carte. All the dishes we got were tasty!"
129,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It's ok to eat a lot, food acceptable but when you are out you smell like a barbecue."
130,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice table BBQ korean style fish ,meat and veggies..."
131,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, food arrived fast every time and we never had to ask for drinks as they were offered to us as soon as our glasses were empty.
Food is, for its price, very good. Paying ‚Ç¨1 or ‚Ç¨2 extra for some things is ‚Ä¶"
132,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,a week ago,The fastest service ever seen in Amsterdam!
133,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice concept, fast service and generally good food. There is abig variety of dishes, some of them is ""ready to eat"" dishes and some ""raw"" dishes you grill yourself on the grill at the center of the table. Vegeterian dishes are also ‚Ä¶"

138,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I expected less cause i have been to many korean restaurants but there is always something missing from the food. But for Miss Korea? It way beyond my expectation. We didnt have reservation yet the server still give us place to sit while it ‚Ä¶
139,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"You can try Korean-style BBQ in an all-you-can-eat setting. They also serve other miscellaneous Korean dishes, such as sundubu(soft-tofu stew), which are of decent quality. But, yes, it's quite pricey. And the ventilation is almost non-existent, so you'll smell like another fresh-grilled meat when you step out of the door."
140,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,a year ago,Plates are served quickly // dumplings are nice unfortunately the meat is tasteless and extremely fatty (I understand the fat brings flavor but the portions served shower barely no meat on the bones).
141,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, but felt hurried as they kept coming and told us the kitchen would close and that we needed to order more quickly. The staff were not attentive other than telling us to hurry. ‚Ä¶"
142,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best service I have received in Amsterdam in this 2 years. Staffs are super friendly and food are delicious! ‚Ä¶
143,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious Korean BBQ as always!!! Completely worth its money! 6ppl -
We strategically ordered food so that we could last the 5 rounds, and we sure did!!! Super satisfying, we even ordered a bunch of drinks, rice wine, Soju and ‚Ä¶"
144,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious Korean food. Barbecue at the table. Friendly staff. Reasonable price with all food you can eat. Nice atmosphere. The restaurant is full, so you should reserve in advance."
145,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, especially the beef stew. A bit slow for service but then the resta was completely full."
146,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very reasonable price for a all you can eat barbecue. The food selections are pretty good, quality is also decent. ‚Ä¶"
147,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Great for dining as a large group as it is fun to cook the food yourselves. Be warned your clothes will smell of Korean bbq once you leave so don't go after work in your best suit. There is no extractor over the tables and the food is OK hence the 3 stars.
148,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Great authentic Korean BBQ experience. After tasting Korean food in Asia, i can attest to the fact that it taste just as the Koreans would cook and eat it. Nice ambiance, though be prepared that after the evening at the restaraunt you whole outfit and hair will smell grill meat. Reasonably priced for the amount of food you get."
149,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious and fun restaurant with great service and a good price for all you can eat Korean bbq! Five rounds of three dishes per person are offered but we didn't make it past round two and were more than satisfied. Definitely recommended :)
150,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"its ok.. i personally dont like the concept of ‚Äûall you can eat‚Äú and of course you can not accept best quality meat for that price. but all in all, it was ok... service is good, good choice of korean food, good ‚Äûspicy-level‚Äú. you can definitly go here, and if you like to eat a lot, its perfect for you"
151,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, nice setting. The place used to be a chinese restaurant but they changed the theme to Korean BBQ which is totally different. The meat is good quality and the sause is tasty. Also the aspect of grilling your own meat is nice."
152,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, unlimited time. Try the chum churum!"
153,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Quality food, a bit above average pricing.
Menu is long, but ok - choice is somewhat limited compared to similar restaurants. ‚Ä¶"
154,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Not recommending this place unless you need an Asian food fix. The food doesn‚Äôt taste great and defo no where near authentic Korean food. The only dish i would recommend is the beef+vege stew. Even their kimchi tastes weird, like an express ‚Ä¶"
155,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Not good at all. The soup tasted like straight up Soja sauce and everything else wasn‚Äôt to my liking either
156,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I ate until it hurt, and it was worth it. Great food, don't mess it up by cooking it wrong. ‚Ä¶"
157,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,All you can eat Korean BBQ is always a good idea. I recommend to go mainly for the BBQ as it is good quality meat. The rest is not that interesting. Especially the sushi is boring. Expect to smell of fried food afterwards as the ventilation ‚Ä¶
158,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is an all you can eat Korean Barbecue place where you get a set number of rounds of food that you can order. For 2 people, it was 6 rounds of 6 items each. The food is really really good. I highly recommend the Pork/Beef/Chicken ‚Ä¶"
159,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I could not ask for more !!! Fresh and tasty food all you can eat!!! Nice location near DE PIJP, good price and very nice and professional staff. The only thing is that my clothes were smelling for two days after i even wash thrm,but this is normal. It s not a restaurant fault... i will go again very soon"
160,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A great place, once a year and preferably with a group of friends. Miss Korea is a true (Korean) BBQ place, meaning that you grill your food in front of you in an enclosed room... Yeap, that's also the main issue - you will SMELL! As a tip ‚Ä¶"
161,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Too less staff to run entire restaurant. Difficult to get attention for ordering.
162,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The quality of the food is really poor, the staff is not particularly friendly and when you will go out from this place your clothes will badly smell barbecue. I honestly I wanted to give 2 stars instead of 1 but when I asked to have some ‚Ä¶"
163,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great delicious dish. Too bad no special korean cold tea! And the worst is that the room is very smelly especially when all ppl cook on their own. Should really change the system in the restaurant. Finding parking place is difficult around the area.
164,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very delicious combination, one of the best all you can eat do it yourself Asian rest"
165,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious and came out super quick! My friend and I liked it so much we went back the next day haha. As an added bonus, the staff were very friendly!"
166,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,a year ago,"imho cheap meat quality, no air conditioner (really hot in summer), kind of expensive, nothing compared with a real korean bbq, good if you have no comparison point."
167,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was good, service and atmosphere were also nice. That's about all I have to say. ‚Ä¶"
168,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great food and fast and friendly service
169,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,a year ago,Staff is very welcoming. Food is good and served quickly. The ice cream at the end is a very nice way to finish the night!
170,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cooking your own food on BBQ. Service not particularly attentive. Often get tables mixed up. Not so much a problem, as it's all you can eat. If something doesn't just re-order. Good for groups"
171,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,8 months ago,worst food ever. I feel bad for someone that's trying out korean food for the first time in this kind of restaurant.
172,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic staff and incredible food. Our dining experience was excellent thanks to the cozy atmosphere and very friendly staff!

175,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to enjoy korean bbq. The staff is very nice and helpful and theres a great variety between barbeque dishes and other things like sushi, noodles or rice dishes! If u want to enjoy some great kbbq in amsterdam go to this place. ‚Ä¶"
176,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty good. Little portions but lots of rounds then you can eat lots of different things. Be aware your clothing will stink if you cook in the barbecue. But it deserve it!!
177,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Even with tempered expectations, this place fell far below it. The reasons you go to korean bbq (all you can eat, or not), is for 1) the meats, 2) the banchan sides, and 3) the flavors. This place fell flat on all three counts, seriously. ‚Ä¶"
178,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,4 years ago,Chinases based Korean food. Only ice cream was good. Pork belly structure was strange.
179,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Star for the all you can eat and at a cheap price. However, if you think this is how Korean BBQ should be done, you're mistaken. Had the worst time with the slow service, poor ventilation, greasy floor, and the worst part was the meat ‚Ä¶"
180,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"All you can eat restaurant. (3 dishes per round, 5 rounds) Kind staff, food ranges from okay to good (better than bland all you can eat sushi), clean environment. Authentic Korean dishes, but misses the authentic korean flavor. They used to ‚Ä¶"
181,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Its not really what you are looking for when you want authentic Korean food. If you have been to Korea before, you will notice that every dish is a off. That isn't really a problem if it taste good imo. They spend little attention to detail ‚Ä¶"
182,Miss Korea BBQ, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The positives: there is food here.
The negatives: the food is quite tasteless and unauthentic, there is almost no ventilation so you will smell like hell afterwards, and if you order a bottle of ‚Ä¶"

184,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place and kind staff but can be extremely busy so if they don‚Äôt chat you then it isn‚Äôt a problem.  If at Central Station, take the 24 tram to Marie Hagenplein (sorry it isn‚Äôt on my tram app) or take 16 tram to Albert Cuypstraat and ‚Ä¶"

187,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Authentic Korean BBQ and great service in de pijp. Lekker food and the best part is it's all you can eat!! Highly recommended in Amsterdam. A hidden jewel as I'm a huge foodie!
188,Miss Korea BBQ, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Perfect place if you're in the mood for Korean BBQ. The option 'unlimited' gives you 5 rounds which are enough to eat your heart out. Food and choice are good though not top level.
189,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,2 years ago,We called them at 3 PM when they opened to make a reservation. The woman told us to come ‚Äúat 5 till 7.‚Äù What does that mean? It means 18:55. We thought it was odd but whatever. We arrive at 18:45 and the same woman refused to seat us ‚Ä¶

But the quality wasn't  as expected for 30 ‚Ç¨ ...

193,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My first experience of a DIY Korean bbq, but it was really tasty food, helpful staff, and delicious ice-cream too! Try not to over-order as you will be charged for what you don't eat, and they view it as rude, which is fair! I wouldn't ‚Ä¶"

203,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are looking for authentic Korean food (they have much more than bbq meat), come here. Reservations in advance are highly recommended, as Miss Korea is usually quite busy. Staff serves a lot of plates, so might seem rushed, but are ‚Ä¶"
204,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was so fun. Get reservations. The concept is great and the way you order is cool. My wife and kids were very wary but afterwards kept talking about how much they loved it.
205,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Even as a vegetarian, they have a very good selection for their 5 course -15 item menu. Good luck on getting to even the 4th round if you're a meat eater; my buddies could barely walk afterwards. ‚Ä¶"

209,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The service became worse, leaving us with bad impression. Food is okayish also. I used to like to visit but not anymore after tonight's visit. Better to train the staffs since restaurant is not only about food but also service quality."
210,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,3 years ago,Food was delicious until we got lamb in bad stated and smelly. So bad experience. They wanted to include the bad meat in the bill! after they did not try to solve the problem.

212,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Enjoyed eating at this all you can eat bbq restaurant. Great food, fast service. There are not many bbq all you can eat restaurants in town. That's why it's very popular."
213,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Really good food and extremely nice, polite & funny personel"
214,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Not great and not really alk you can eat. They also make you get a drink no matter what as if 30‚Ç¨ per person already wasn't enough and they get in your ass the whole dinner time to ask if you want more drinks. Had to go drink tap water from bathroom sink and I'm very proud to say it.
215,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is nice and quick service.  Had buffet there, and turned out need to book a table. Luckily for us there's an empty table"

217,Miss Korea BBQ, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I'm korean and for me it was as good as the restaurants in Korea. The Kimchi here was really authentic and it tasted exactly like traditional Korean Kimchi. Most of all, it's all you can eat, so you can try lots of different Korean food."
218,Miss Korea BBQ, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is ok and you leave the place full, but it's not very authentic: sushi at a korean restaurant. Regular beer

244,Miss Korea BBQ, 1 star ,4 years ago,"People, this is not Korean food.  Take it from a Korean traveling through Europe.  The food tasted like Chinese food with Chinese seasonings that destroyed how the Korean food should taste like.  More accurate name for this restaurant is ""Miss China."""
