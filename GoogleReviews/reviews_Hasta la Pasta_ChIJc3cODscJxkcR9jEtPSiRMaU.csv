21,Hasta la Pasta, 1 star ,a year ago,Food was awful. I was optimistic that it would be good as the chef was cooking in front of us. He was still using the microwave for something I thought would be fresh. The pasta was swimming in oil and tomato puree. There was an elderly man …

389,Hasta la Pasta, 3 stars ,a week ago,"Eten was ok. Het vertrouwen van de zaakvoerder enorm. Betalen kon enkel cash, maar  dat had ik niet bij. Hij vertrouwde me wanneer ik geld ging afhalen 100 meter verder. Leuk om te ervaren.
For the record: ik heb hem netjes betaald. 😉"
