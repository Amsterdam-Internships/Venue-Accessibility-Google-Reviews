10,De Biergrill, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The place changed its concept a few months ago because the listened to the neighbourhood.

12,De Biergrill, 1 star ,4 years ago,"By fat the worst burger i have eaten; really bad presentation, the bread was very cheap, they didn't even cut the lettuce, just threw big pieces there, and on top of that i found it very pricey! Not recommend it at all!"
