0,Restaurant Bonjour, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Bistro Bonjour is a good French restaurant in Amsterdam. It is not over the top and yet it is not pretentious either. The menu is predictable but the quality is decent. The quality price ratio is fair  and correct. All dishes were savoury …
1,Restaurant Bonjour, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It is a cozy, warm restaurant. The bread delivered to the table is crispy and tasty. The butter served with it is full of garlic - yum!
We started with the French onion soup. The broth had plenty of flavor and the …"
2,Restaurant Bonjour, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing restaurant with amazing cuisine.  Adding the service, it became ""my restaurant"".  I highly recommend ""Veal Fillet""."
3,Restaurant Bonjour, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Not a huge fan, but certainly not terrible. Maybe we ordered wrong."
4,Restaurant Bonjour, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Fantastic little French bistro - oldest in Amsterdam - just off the main rembrantplein. Amazing food, service and ambience. Worth looking beyond the busy area"
5,Restaurant Bonjour, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great location, delicious food and friendly service. Highly recommend!"
6,Restaurant Bonjour, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Nice staff and well grilled meat. Else, simple and blend. Sauces from a can. French fries not even fresh. This restaurant is so simple that no chef is needed. Just someone to grill the meet. Quite embarrassing restaurant I must say, especially at such a location."
7,Restaurant Bonjour, 1 star ,2 years ago,We went with social deal; I am really surprised from the good reviews received. I am sure that something must have changed because my experience was very bad. Almost nothing from the 4 course menu was good. The lamb ( if it was lamb..)was not edible. The location and space are nice but cannot compensate for the bad quality of food.
8,Restaurant Bonjour, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I do not recommend it on the grounds of the service. We went on an unfortunate occasion as there was a table of more than 30 (seemed to be students) being served at the same time as our reservation. Needless to say, service hit rock bottom …"
9,Restaurant Bonjour, 5 stars ,7 years ago,I've eaten here 4 times. Each time was fantastic. This is one of my favorite spots in Amsterdam. My favorite is the Tornadoes with a Blue Cheese sauce. It's hard to beat that tender steak with it's creamy sauce. The frites are very good and …

11,Restaurant Bonjour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Most authentic place in town, great French cuisine for a very Dutch price (that's cheap). Its been here for years and isn't going to disappear any time soon, so long as people keep appreciating the good old fashion family business that have been here for years"
12,Restaurant Bonjour, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Consistently great food with a lovely terrace on a quiet canal. We dined here a lot during our trip to Amsterdam because we knew we were guaranteed a great meal for a fair price.

20,Restaurant Bonjour, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Small restaurant to look at but is longer than expected when you are inside, a bit dark but this added to the atmosphere. Food was excellent."
21,Restaurant Bonjour, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Service was ok. The food was mediocre at best. I've ordered a lamb steak and parts of it were raw (not even rare which I like).
