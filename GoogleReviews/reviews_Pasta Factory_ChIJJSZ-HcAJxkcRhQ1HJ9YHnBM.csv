Great food
Recommended to go and eat"
2,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Just nice. Dishes wasn't that special
3,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious homemade pasta! We also ordered a pizza which was delicious. The resturant space is almost large enough to find a place for ordering and eating your food. Their staff were polite and kind. If you are a pasta lover, definitely you have to try their pasta specially with tomato juice."
4,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,4 months ago,The first impression was not good. The place was overcrowded and the waitress keep passing me and my husband as if we were not there. We had to walk to the kitchen entrance to ask if they had any table available. After we've sit down it ‚Ä¶
5,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Sauces are flavourless (we tried a few different things as a group) and portions are tiny even for a small woman. It's quite expensive as well. Do absolutely not order any form of salad, you are better of eating a AH salad outside by the canal and buying 3 bottle of wine for the same price to drown the memories of this place."
6,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We really enjoyed our late afternoon visit to the Pasta Factory, the staff did their best from the outset to make our stay a success. The food arrived very quickly, was freshly prepared and very tasty. The prices were reasonable. Overall a resounding success."
7,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Got tempted to try it since it said it‚Äôs homemade pasta. I ordered the 4 cheese pasta and I can say it was alright nothing special. The pasta was bit dry and I had to add lemon and chili to make it better. The waiter is very friendly and ‚Ä¶
8,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Our order was taken extremely fast, drinks came fast, food came fast. Pasta was good. The pizza was okay. The cheese was rubbery, the crust was bland, but the the seasoning on the pizza was perfect not to strong but was just the right ‚Ä¶"
9,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Small location, pasta was good and preparation was pretty fast. The small italian staff women was very friendly and funny, while others where a bit stressed. Toilets could be cleaner."
10,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Nice place, very welcoming host and (the most important) great pasta. 5/5 would have carbonara again"
11,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,3 months ago,"It looked like a nice place, but the service is awful. Due to corona restrictions restaurants are working till 5pm but they didn't let us in at 4pm. Still serving other customers. Also refused to at least use their WC (requested 1‚Ç¨)."
12,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Super tasty and fresh pasta! Prices are around 14 euros for a plate of delicious pasta. RECOMMEND!
13,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Serves gluten free pasta and overall it‚Äôs a basic and ok place to get something warm in your belly.
Friendly service."

18,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place serves very decent pasta. Inexpensive and quality taste. Its well recommended for tourists and locals.
19,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,9 months ago,The food is less than good. The pasta amount was not enough for the price. I ordered broccoli and payed for it and they have two mini pieces. There was no sauce only a little at the bottom. I was really disappointed.. the service was good and they were friendly but the food wasn‚Äôt .
20,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Super friendly staff, delicious pasta! Will be coming back here!"
21,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My husband loves pasta and he loved this. I hate pasta and I loved this. Don't let the casual appearance fool you, it is more upscale. There's a sign that says pasta starting at 6.50‚Ç¨, but we didn't actually see it on the menu. Having said ‚Ä¶"

26,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service, great food, great atmosphere! Went in on a Saturday evening for dinner and didn't have to wait long to sit down.

27,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely food! Visited here twice within the 5 days we were in the country. Good, affordable food, good quantity, friendly staff and fast service"
28,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious homemade pasta! We took the pesto, fungi tagliatelle and it was wonderful! The only disadvantage is the cleaning, dirty toilets and a lot of flies, but it still didn't stop us from coming here twice."
29,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food, fast service and really nice and friendly employees. Hidden gem. Tried the pasta and the pizza and they are great. Would definitely come again."
30,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Be precise of how much you wish to eat...I got a small portion of pasta that wasn't even half of my appetite...
You wish you try the cheese bread/ pizza they have. It's heaven üòç"

Was a customer of them for the last 2 years.

36,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,6 months ago,If you go in Amsterdam you must go into that restaurant. The pastas are awesome the price are cheap and the waitress is extremely friendly.

39,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"very tasty and good staff, 37‚Ç¨ for 2 pasta and beer"
40,Pasta Factory, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Pizza tastes like frozen. I think it actually was bought at supermarket.
41,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect and saucy pasta and nice service! The place looks very simple, feels like made for tourists only with plastic models of food served in the windows, but surprisingly the food and prices worth trying. I will strongly recommend to try salmon tagliatelle! Probably a bigger range of wine and beers would be nice!"
42,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place is truly a gem! The food was s delicious and freshly made. Upon request, it can be made gluten-free, lactose-free, or even fully vegan. The atmosphere is charming and the owner/staff is super sweet! I highly recommend stopping by."

44,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely not a good service and the pasta dishes were just decent for being called ""The Pasta Factory"". Normal prices seen the location. Not coming back."

48,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great experience, nice food and place, just few minutes walking from the flower market.
Truly recommend the ""Tortellaci neri"""
49,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little place. The shrimp pasta with garlic and olive oil was super tasty. Service is great, though I was told I can't get tap water because the boss is around, so be prepared to pay 3 Euro for a tiny bottle of water."
50,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Not very similar to traditional Italian places and more like a fast food place. The pasta was still quite tasty.
51,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,2 years ago,To be honest they don't even deserve the one star! It was the worst service and food I ever had in Amsterdam (and not only). I paid ‚Ç¨15.50 for a portion of pasta with cheese. In the menu they mentioned the pasta is homemade even though it ‚Ä¶
52,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful food and comfortable atmosphere. The portions are huge, two people could probably share one main. The staff are friendly and attentive but not over the top. It‚Äôs a wonderful place to tuck into some lovely food, catch up with friends and drink. If you‚Äôre ever passing I‚Äôd recommend popping in for a bite."
53,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice and friendly people, and very delicous food. Selfmade bread and noodles. When you want to eat some italian food, this is your place!"
54,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is really nice! The pasta and the focaccia dishes are so fresh and really delicious! I mostly go there if I have a craving for Italian and also its next to a movie theater! Try this place guys! Because its worth it. ‚Ä¶

57,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had such a great dinner here. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting. Our waiter was extremely friendly and nice. The food was absolutely delicious. The salad was very fresh and the cheese on the pasta and flatbread was so yummy.
58,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Rude Staff, decent food for tourists not meant tor any Italian food"
59,Pasta Factory, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Went here with friends. The food is way overpriced and some of the combinations of the food just don't work. We all didn't really enjoy what we got and it was definatly not worth the price we paid. The pasta dishes are very bland and has ‚Ä¶
60,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They can make any pasta gluten-free (gluten-vrij), which is awesome! Fantastic, fresh, delicious selection of dishes, from lasagna to pasta, you won't really go wrong with this Italian cuisine. Definitely recommend if you're looking for gluten-free friendly dining (even if you're not, definitely check it out!)"
61,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ok, my girlfriend insisted to go there since it's a great place for pasta.
Walking in the place isn't that bad for a commercial city restaurant.
Menu is simple and solid. ‚Ä¶"
62,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a great little place for some good self-made pasta. It's always busy and the food tastes good. It's not the best pasta place out there but definitely one of the better ones out there. It can take a long time before somebody helps you, mostly because it's so busy. You can sit down to eat."
63,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Might be my worst experience in Amsterdam. We have ordered starters and main courses, but we got everything at the same time. When we complained we were told it is our fault for not explicitly telling to get the starters first (the first ‚Ä¶"

66,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A place with delicious food and normal prices.
67,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,3 years ago,No taste at all... I guess that's why the salt shaker at the table was almost empty. Good fast service though!
68,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"BEST PASTA EVER hands down üòçüòç
Prices are lowkey higher than other restaurants, but totally worth it, also it makes sense, because they provide gluten free pasta.
Nice staff, nice and comfortable atmosphere."
69,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"For what it offers it's an excellent choice. Fast, affordable, and tasty. Not very healthy tho taking into account all the butter and cream. But if you don't care about clean eating it's perfect."
70,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,What a great find this was. We were out walking and it was cold (the canals were frozen) and wanted something hot and tasty. We called in as we had read good reviews about their home made pasta. ‚Ä¶
71,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Me and my partner came on a weekday evening around 7pm so we skipped the tea time rush. ‚Ä¶
72,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It can get very busy but the homemade pasta is delicious. A bit expensive
73,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is alright. Besides the price, I didn't like my dish&found hair in it, got blamed that it is my hair although it wasn't. After a few minutes they agreed to replace my dish and it was alright(ordered pasta before, replaced it to ‚Ä¶"
74,Pasta Factory, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was okay but way too expensive, had to use a lot of the condiments and old cheese to make it taste like something...
The lady was very nice (sorry lady) but the bald cook/waiter was very rude en we were told it was our fault that their PIN machine broke down."
75,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worst customer service I have ever come across in my entire life and of all the places that I have visited. The waiter had a problem explaining the items in the menu. The menu was in Dutch and on enquiring I was told ""You don't know ‚Ä¶"

77,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The Service ist absolutly unconfident i wait 20min for my drinks and the Prices are too high. For an Pizza 16,50 ? Is this a golden Pizza ?. And they gave me plastic Cutlery it was a verg big disaster. The Food was ver very bad. The Spaghetti Cabonara were looking like a souup. 0 Stars my friends."
78,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"After walking for 2 hours Pasta Factory was a really nice surprise for street with a lot of fast food, this is paradise."

Waiter was rude and arrogant. Not enough cutlery and when asked took a very long time to come while food was getting cold. 2 meals were wrong and all food ‚Ä¶"
81,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A factory indeed: pastas as well as other dishes such as salads, focaccia and bruschetti come with great speed to your table, served by friendly and helpful waiters. Yet, friendly does not always mean good. ‚Ä¶"
82,Pasta Factory, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place for authentic Italian food.
Nice taste and ambiance.
Prices are bit on the higher side. ‚Ä¶"
83,Pasta Factory, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Pasta is very plain and not really tasty. I had to add a lot of salt, pepper and cheese. Chicken is dry and hard. The only plus is a big portion but if the food isn‚Äôt good it doesn‚Äôt matter. I didn‚Äôt finish even the half of it. ‚Ä¶"
84,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great price quality food. If you are looking to get some decent Italian without the sharp Amsterdam prices this is a perfect place. Which is surprising by the good location but I am not complaining. You will come out satisfied
85,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great portions and amazing taste üòç
86,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"For me the word ""Factory"" means that it's a fast restaurant. But it's not. You sit down and waiters are coming. I got here early, so I got my food fast, but there were big groups arriving after me, I guess they had to wait more for the ‚Ä¶"

91,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A place right in the center of Amsterdam that may not look that special from the outside but it's THE place to be if you want to eat something around Rembrandtplein or De Munt that is cosy and has good service. And the food is AMAZING. The ‚Ä¶

100,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,2 years ago,"IT was so bad service. When you walked in, nobody greets you. You need to find a table by yourself and after ordered 30 mins. They did not even bring your drinks. At last we just left after 30mins waiting for nothing. Never come back and not recommend it. Very angry and disappointed."
101,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was fantastic, tasty, well prepared and very kind staff. Fresh self made pasta."
