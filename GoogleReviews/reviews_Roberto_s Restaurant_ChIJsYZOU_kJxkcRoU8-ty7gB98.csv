5,Roberto's Restaurant, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A decent traditional, authentic Italian restaurant. Highly professional staff. There is nothing wrong with the restaurant.

They still charged me for the chicken and side dish. Had to go to straight up to my hotel room and clean my teeth and i might clean them again. At least the waiter was nice."

However Roberto's is quite popular and for a reason - the pasta was nicely cooked and the wine selection - exceptional. I should also mention the charming interior - truly elegant and in European style.
