4,In 't Vierde Baarsje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Went here for a group dinner and it was superb. The food is delicious and the service super. Start your evening in the bottom bar and relax until you are ready to sit down and enjoy a delicious meal. Loved it.
5,In 't Vierde Baarsje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very very good restaurant. Very unique in Amsterdam because it's a trip down memory lane where they still prepare your food next to your table. Very friendly people large variety in the menu and a romantic atmosfeer. A must Go
6,In 't Vierde Baarsje, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A quirky little hole that tries to be more posh than it really is, seems to boast of a a middle-aged clientele that dresses serious for the occassion. The sauces to the main dishes are well-made, some even made in front of you if you wish for the show factor. Mediocre starters, okay wines. A safe choice, but nothing completely amazing."
