1,San Siro, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I just love this place! Fast, super cheap and delicious. The best pizza in Amsterdam, de Pijp, without any doubts but it's a good idea to take-away because the pizzeria is actually quite small and mainly delivery-oriented. Service is friendly and quick.

Anyway cheap, great staff, cute cat that lives in the kitchen, lots of cheese on the pizza.
Love it."
