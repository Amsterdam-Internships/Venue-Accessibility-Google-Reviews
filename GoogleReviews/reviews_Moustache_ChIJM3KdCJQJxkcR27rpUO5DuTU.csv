1,Moustache, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such a cute restaurant! We arrived early for dinner so their menu was limited but SO good. The pizzas are delicious. The decor fits together perfectly & the staff was very friendly.
2,Moustache, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Though having 2 glasses of wine only I enjoyed bar. Very laid back vibe and nice staff. Oh my, sauvignon was good..."
3,Moustache, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Extremely nice restaurant and cafe, with friendly (though not overly attentive) staff and a great ambience. The food is good, the drinks too, and the atmosphere is warm and cozy."
4,Moustache, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Came for lunch. They have many lovely lemonades in unusual flavors (sweet potato + cinnamon, for example). The lunch menu is typical for a cafe (sandwiches, few warm pastas, few salads). I had the truffle egg salad, it was very tasty and a …"
5,Moustache, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice location but super long times between service. We order one round of drinks and never got asked again if we would like another.
My friend says he comes a few times and this always happens. …"
6,Moustache, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cute little restaurant just outside the busy part of the Amsterdam city centre. Trendy/hip atmosphere with worn furniture. Serves Italian cuisine which is very good. The squid starter is amazing! Pretty decent wine selection too, well if they actually have the bottle you pick... Friendly staff though."
7,Moustache, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice wines, good food, relaxed environment, and good service.. What more can you ask for?"
8,Moustache, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Decent service, but a bit slow. You will need to wave down your server, who forgot some drinks. …"
9,Moustache, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Very comfortable small restaurant in our neighborhood. Excellent pasta dishes but the run out quickly. Get there early to grab a seat. Wifi is also good if you need to catch up on work with a glass of good wine.

11,Moustache, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Lovely cosy and warm cafe! Went just for a tea but couldn't resist the carrot cake in the counter so I ended up getting a piece! Plus, the employees are all super friendly! It's becoming  more and more popular among locals"
12,Moustache, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We loved the food but not the very slow service. By the time we got our mains, I was so hungry I didn't care they'd got my order wrong. Even so, I'd go back. The food was that good."
13,Moustache, 1 star ,7 years ago,"The Good: Spoke perfect English when we made the reservation and charged us €19 for 5 ravioli, I seriously thought it was a appetizer. …"

15,Moustache, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I absolutely love this location and their atmosphere, but the food was over priced for the portions and the service was...non existent. Good place to go if you just want to chill and you're not expecting the most."

19,Moustache, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"nice place and good prices, but we were waiting 5 minutes to see if we can have a seat and afterwards waited more than half an hour because waiter totally forgot our order. Also impolite service"
20,Moustache, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst pizza ever.  No oil, no seasoning, so dry. Also, the service was not good. Wouldn't go back... there are a million bars in Amsterdam - try another."
21,Moustache, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Bar Moustache is an easygoing place, good crowd, cool staff. One of my favorites for early saturday afternoon drinks that turn into dinner that turn into more drinks that turn into trouble, and waking up midday on Sunday with a new piercing …"
