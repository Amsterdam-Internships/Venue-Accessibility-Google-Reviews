0,Vida, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is nice and food is so so (depending on what you order), but for being a tapas restaurant it‚Äôs overly expensive. Tapas are small bites but in Spain tapas are bigger. Octopus was supposed to be a la gallega with  potatoes and ‚Ä¶"
1,Vida, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you like to share small dishes and high quality food, with a nice drink, this is a must. Ambient is quite relaxed and cozy. Service normally is very good and the selection of tapas is always satisfying.  Approved by quiquinn Stars."
2,Vida, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Friendly and attentive staff. Take at least 3 options from menu when ordering. Good selection of wines. Loved the interior design.
3,Vida, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice and cool place! brew their own IPA, but had none when I was there :-("
4,Vida, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was tasty and the restaurant had a nice atmosphere, however I felt the portions were very small for the price, compared to other tapas restaurants I have been to in Amsterdam.  The service was also slow and there didn't seem to be enough staff.  Having said that, the quality of the food and drink was good."
5,Vida, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely location, well made and presented food. Tasted really good, but unfortunately the service could not deliver adequately what was well crafted in the kitchen. ‚Ä¶"
6,Vida, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food here is delicious. This goes for all the 7 dishes we ordered. Loved the lamb cotteletes. What was annoying is that they were ""out of"" the main dishes that you expect at a tapas place (such as patatas bravas) and the main beer they ‚Ä¶"
7,Vida, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing staff. Anthousa was the most amazing. Customer service was outstanding and so welcoming. Prices are reasonable. Food was also excellent. We had several tapas, but the Vinson, lamb, salmon, beets, and croquettes. Enjoyable experience through and through. Cozy but upbeat."

11,Vida, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food quality with a wide variety of worthwhile options to choose from. Some typical Spanish, others more ""Mediterranean"". Service was friendly and helpful (and honest) when deciding over additional plates to order."
12,Vida, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I ordered ham, 2 tapas and a main. All of them were delicious. Nice ambiance, reasonable prices, good music in the background. I'll definitely visit again."
13,Vida, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Reasonable food, but service is extremely slow. I ordered 5 tapas and it took 40 min between the first dish and the last. By the time the last dish came I was not hungry anymore. I was used to the concept that all tapas come more or less at the same time, that's why the dishes are rather small"
14,Vida, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice meal, nice place, nice staff. Recommended!"
15,Vida, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Food was actually pretty good. Except for the patatas bravas. They should be a no-brainer. Seating is nice as well. But the service was not good at all. Fake smiles accompanied by snobby looks. Would not come again.
