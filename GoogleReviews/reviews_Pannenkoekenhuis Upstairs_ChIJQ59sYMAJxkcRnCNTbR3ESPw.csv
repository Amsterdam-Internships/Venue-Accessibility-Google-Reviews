The pancakes were kinda expensive, but its Amsterdam after all and located really in the center. ‚Ä¶"
1,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Probably the most ""typical Dutch"" place to have your mandatory pancakes. Very unique atmosphere at Europe's smallest restaurant. Feels like a home meal at Grandma's. Pancakes were delicious. Might go for sweet next time."

3,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 months ago,This place is just special.  The food and customer service is top notch. But for me it was the taste that made it heaven for me. It wasn't just another good pancake.  It took me back to childhood when grandma made us pancakes with berries. ‚Ä¶
4,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,A cozy hidden gem in the center of Amsterdam! Pleasant home-like atmosphere and the owners are very nice.  Make sure to book in advance as there are only three tables.
5,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious and filling! I had the Miranda pancake and it was very tasty! The ambiance is quaint in a 16th century convent turned hospital turned family home turned restaurant. Only a handful of tables so reservations are required and no ‚Ä¶

20,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a wonderful pancake restaurant located up a narrow set of stairs.There are only 4 tables so come before they open or make a reservation. The brie and bacon pancake stole the show.  Service was great. Very cute decor inside.
21,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Homely and cute ambience with great homemade, authentic Dutch pancakes. I got the apple cinnamon sugar pancake by recommendation, and it was delightful, tangy, and sweet. The best part of the pancakes was the batter‚Äîwith the perfect balance ‚Ä¶"
22,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a really cute pancake restaurant! There are only 4 tables in the restaurant so I recommend making a reservation or getting there right when they open. The decor and vibes and really cute but the restaurant is cramped. Also you have ‚Ä¶
23,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Very small venue with four tables so reservations are necessary. Welcoming and pleasant staff and cosy atmosphere. Good range of tasty pancakes. A little pricey.
24,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Pancakes were a little pricier but absolutely delicious. Absolutely worth their money. The steep and narrow staircase and the cozy ambiance contributed to making this lunch one of the most beautiful and special lunches I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam ‚Ä¶
25,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great pancakes and a unique experience to boot! Be sure to make a reservation and arrive a few minutes early. They only have 4 small tables and need to get their other guests through. Despite the strict rules, the two co-owners are super friendly. Most importantly, the food is great."
26,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It‚Äôs my first time to try dutch pancakes and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. You have to go up the tiny stairs before reaching this tiny restaurants making it unique. It has cute decors and has a homey feel. We didn‚Äôt know that you have to make ‚Ä¶

28,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"What a wonderful experience. The pancakes were hot and delicious. Unbelievable pancake!!! We tried another place and regretted it immediately, should have walked back to the upstairs pancakes. YOU WON‚ÄôT REGRET THIS PLACE!!!"

31,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So this is a small restaurant (the smallest in Europe) with only 4 tables, so make reservations ahead of time! However, if you have no choice but to come here as a walk-in, it's more than worth the wait. First, we climbed up a steep ‚Ä¶"
32,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very small and cosy pancake cafe. They take COVID compliance very seriously which is highly appreciated. Furthermore, this place is really nice set up with an eye for detailed interior. Probably coming again when my body needs pancakes ü•û"
33,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The pancakes are very good, staff is extremely friendly. There is only a small room (up a pretty steep staircase), so it can easily be full, but we made a short term reservation and had a table 20 minutes later.
The setting in the narrow house is nice and cosy."
34,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute little restaurant up the steep steps (watch your head going up). Very limited seating so make a reservation ahead of time! Super cozy with delicious pancakes both sweet and savory. Highly recommend.
35,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious!! I feel full eating this pancake and the flavors are very balanced. We we're lucky to have a spot in afternoon without reservation. The staff is very friendly and took our order while we waited for people to leave. We got our ‚Ä¶
36,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely little restaurant specialised in Pancakes obviously. Do make a reservation, it has only about 3 or 4 tables with around 15 seats max.
The Pancakes are just fabulous, nice interior decor."
37,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice small space upstairs.

Pancakes were nice and tasty enough. We had the 'Chicken ragoul' and 'Banana and ‚Ä¶"
38,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The strawberry/banana/chocolate pancake that I had here this morning literally brightened up my day. It's been a while since food has had such a comforting effect on me. It's so satisfying when a place you've heard so much about, actually lives up to its acclaim."
39,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So glad I was able to make it to this quaint little restaurant. Delicious pancakes and great service. I was lucky enough to come when lambada strawberries were in season (which is only two months out of the year, according to the kind ‚Ä¶"
40,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome pancake my favorite is Kai must try. Great people and a very unique place better make a booking as the place is supper small and the time is very short. The stair is very steep dont bring stroler if possible no lift just stair. But worthed.
41,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Indeed this is the smallest restaurant in Europe! Situated on the second floor, you have to climb a very steep staircase up and to find yourself in a tight spot with only have 4 small tables in the little cafe, probably for 12 pax at a ‚Ä¶"
42,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Such a great little place! The food is amazing and the couple that owns it is the sweetest. I love the simplicy and that there are only four tables in the whole place. It gives a very intimate vibe and keeps it quiet. Plus you are sitting next to their kitchen so the guys chat with you the entire time (if you want) and are so nice.
43,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Possibly the best pancake in Amsterdam. Great flavor and the perfect texture. Go for the bacon and apple pancake and eat like a local with syrup. Heaven! Book ahead of time as the number of seats are limited. Don‚Äôt panic if you didn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶
44,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,I didn't know places were legally allowed to be so cute. Amazing pancakes. Amazing service.
45,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A cute and cosy pancake restaurant.  It is tiny with limited seats, hence they are strict in their reservation and time policy.  The food is worth it, th service is friendly,  the ambience is interesting.  It gives you a feeling as of you ‚Ä¶"
46,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The place is super unique. Located on the end of a steep ladder. You will not know it if you're not locals! ;) the pancake is super delicious! My favourite is chicken ragout. The interior is authentic with ceiling full of many different kettles.
47,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Based on all the recommendations online, I made a reservation the day before. I was alone, so I had to obviously order both a sweet (chocolate/banana) and savory (bacon/apply) one. Oops, they're huge! Both were delicious and hit the spot. ‚Ä¶"
48,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Either book or go early to queue before it opens at noon. It only has 4 tables. We hadn't made reservations but by chance we went before it opened - so many people turned up and had to be turned away. Fabulous pancakes - we shared the bacon ‚Ä¶
49,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent pancakes with creative toppings. We shared one with bacon, brie, and honey, and another with chocolate, pineapple, and coconut. Both we're an excellent combination of different complementary flavors. Only four tables in this whole place (it's Europe's smallest restaurant) so call and make reservations!"
50,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Traditional and cozy environment. Friendly and fast service. Nice pancakes, especially love the bacon and cheese with honey!"

53,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Small place, big plates! Had the salami and cheese pancake. One plate may be enough for one person. Made to order and the host will ask if you're ready for your second plate. Need reservations to dine or be lucky enough to be squeezed in."
54,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Very tasty. A little bit expensive. They don‚Äôt accept Visa or MasterCard cards, just cash."
55,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Old Amsterdam building (1500s), steep stairs totally worth the wait and climb. Only 4 tables so maybe put on reservation list for a bit later. Did I mention totally worth it?! ‚Ä¶"
56,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Couldn‚Äôt not have been better! It such an experience to see the inside of one of these Amsterdam houses and their steep stairs! The food was amazing and the fact that it‚Äôs only 5 tables makes it so intimate! The cook was so nice and the menu creative! I love how qwerky the decoration is, pictures of the royal family and teapots!"
57,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Original location, very cozy and cool traditional decorations. The pancakes are absolutely great and of good size. Worth every penny!"
58,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fun place for Pancakes  in Amsterdam...you MUST have reservations.... note also very very steep stairs to reach the restaurant... small/ cozy (5 tables) AND amazing collection of teapots that hang from ceiling. üçΩ‚òï
59,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quick service. Perfect Dutch style pancakes. I recommend the speck and cheese. Tiny place, so reserve a table. Very steep stairs, so unfortunately not accessible to wheelchairs."
60,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This very tiny pancake house is located in the center of Amsterdam. We went there as a  big group; 8 people, and barely fit inside! I have to warn you that you have to make a reservation beforehands, and be there on time, as it is too ‚Ä¶"
61,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super sweet owners. Great pancakes. Nice and cozy small place. Reservation needed.
62,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Tiny and overcrowded but worth it. The dutch pancakes are very good and the place is very nice, it's inside a very old house with according interiors look. The service is very fast so if you are in a hurry you can count of that for make up for the possible long wait to get seated."
63,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Extremely unique. We were glad to have come before we even ordered the food.

The pancakes were even more incredible. ‚Ä¶"
64,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super tasty and great staff. The stairs are very steep and narrow, along with a low ceiling. But worth being a bit careful for very yummy pancakes."
65,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a 100% must visit. If you are a local, this is a great place for a special birthday/anniversary/celebration meal and if you are a tourist you must absolutely visit here before you leave. We had high expectations and we were NOT ‚Ä¶"
66,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It's the tiniest and coziest place I have ever been to. I think it's not more then 15qm big. They have literally just about 10 seats. The pancakes are unusual rather just one big than small and many. They taste very good and are reasonable priced for this tiny location.
67,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is small with 4 tables, and the stairs to the upstairs are narrow and steep. Pancakes were more like a thicker crepes but very good though!"
68,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best pancakes I've had. They were traditional and tasted amazing. The ginger and cheese was to die for. Make sure you have time when you arrive there is usually a wait but worth it.
69,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Either salty or sweet, the pancake is delicious and you have plenty of toppings to chose from. Tiny restaurant with 3 tables that really gives you the homemade feeling in a typical old Dutch house (recommend booking to avoid waiting time). Lovely!"
70,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 3 stars ,a year ago,Very tasty pancake and good coffee. But VERY expensive for what it is (14 euros for this one pancake) and there are just a few tables so whenever they see you are finished and there are people waiting they kindly bring you the bill and ask out:)
71,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Make the reservation, which gets you a 4-top for 1 hour (there are only 3 tables). Wife and I split 3 pancakes (yup) and left very satisfied and quite full. Service was speedy and they're efficient. ‚Ä¶"
72,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely worth the climb up the stairs! I walked in and was very lucky to find a table.  I ended up having a random couple join my table due to there only being 4 tables but it was a wonderful experience.  I ordered the brie bacon honey, I think it's the Kaia? It was delicious!"
73,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Quaint and quirky with a great menu!
74,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This might be the world's best pancake house. It's tiny - seats 15 people at most I would say. You won't regret going there, but be sure to make a reservation."
75,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The cutest place ever! Only 4 tables, so go around 1h before you want to eat and make a reservation. They have sweet and savory pancakes, both were amazing!"
76,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place - just be mindful that the stairs to get up there are very, very steep. Once up, it's a small but cozy and pleasant place. I ordered a pancake with chocolate sauce and I must say it was probably one of the best I've ever had. Loved it!"
77,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A small in Amsterdam serving incredible pancakes, holy moly they are delicious. And the sheer variety it just incredible. Come early or prepare to wait because they only have 4 tiny tables in the upstairs. But It is quite worth it!."
78,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 3 stars ,a year ago,The pancakes with beef are too salty. I wanted a pancake with butter but They didnt have butter! Overpriced place.10 euros for one with beef and 7 euros for a super tiny print of lemon juice...
79,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"An experience! Delicious Dutch pancakes in an unforgettable setting. There are only 4 tables in this adorable pancake house but it's worth getting there when they open at noon or putting your name down for a table and strolling around the area. You feel like you are sitting at a Dutch ""Oma's"" kitchen table!"
80,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Got the last free table at midday on a Sunday. The place is tiny and was packed. Quick service and nice food. We actually bumped into this place by accident, again, after 21 years! Nice coincidence"
81,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What an awesome little pankoek restaurant. The place is tiny and run by a husband and wife, who I guess have been doing this for a very long time! The service is efficient but nice. The place is very small but cosy and quirky. The pancakes are just awesome. You need a reservation but well worth making time for this!"
82,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super cute and tiny (especially as a tall Dutchie) restaurant. But totally worth it, amazingly friendly staff, great pancakes and fast service.10/10 would recommend!"
83,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious pancake house up steep stairs, as advertised. Surprisingly reasonable prices if you can get in, since they only have 5 small tables. Charming teapots hang all over the roof too. Recommend."
84,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Need to book in advance, tables are available every quarter of an hour. The restaurant is really small and you have to climb the steep narrow staircase. However, these are all worth the efforts! The bacon and brie pancake with syrup was impeccable!"
85,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,BEST PANCAKES I HAD! Would definitely recommend this lovely shop! The shop is tiny with only 4 tables and they're usually full so call or drop by to make a reservation and you'll be whisked in right at your reservation time! Their original ‚Ä¶
86,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,a year ago,Awesome. If you want to experience pancakes in a new way. Thats the place. Homelike ambiente. Clean. Friendly. Price is up but ok.
87,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really great pancakes. A true original in the heart of Amsterdam. You have to climb a narrow steep way to find just a few seats in a cozy living room. Find a wide variety of savory and sweet pancakes (pannenkoeken). We‚Äôve had bacon with syrup and red wine pear with heavy whipped cream. Soooooo good.
88,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cosy and quaint shop. Remember to call and book in advanced!! they only have 4 tables available to sit in. I had the chocolate pancake for ‚Ç¨7.50 and it was yummy!! however, my friend didn‚Äôt really like the bacon and apple combination (but that could just be a personal preference?) Prices was a little high though."

92,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Stairs are super narrow in width and length even a sober person will fall. The upstairs dining area is very small if I remember correctly there's probably only 3 tables and we were squeezed in so tightly. But yes, back to the pancake. It ‚Ä¶"
93,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really cute restaurant although not suitable for huge people üòÖ The pancakes were solid and delicious.
94,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Really cosy little restaurant on top of one of the steepest flight of stairs I have ever taken, but really worth it."
95,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredibly cool and cozy place! Walking upstairs on very, very small steps leads you to a room with only 4 tables and about 15 seats. Pancakes were fantastic and the staff very friendly. But why the music is German is still an unanswered question."
96,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beyond the steepest stairs of your life awaits delicious food, kind staff, and a cozy atmosphere. My husband and I split a Dutch pancake with strawberry jam. If you do one thing kind to yourself, let it be to eat here."

98,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 1 star ,a year ago,"Didn't like the banana chocolate pancake. It's a weird tasting chocolate sauce. Nutella would be much better üòõ

99,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome place to have a meal and experience such a small restaurant operation. Best pancakes to be had here.

101,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful setting and very friendly staff. Do book in advance though as it is TINY (three tables if I remember right) so turning up on the day they probably won‚Äôt have space for you.
102,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super authentic and tasty pancakes; try both the sweet and savoury ones cause they each have their own charm.
The decor is welcoming and magical, this place is a 10/10."
103,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"This is an adorable place upstairs in a canal house. Really cozy atmosphere and lovely pancakes. Call ahead because the place is tiny. Stairs are also steep, so it‚Äôs unfortunately not accessible for everyone."

113,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a very cold day and I needed something warm for lunch. I bumped into this quaint place, very busy but the welcoming owner prepared a savoury cheese/tomato pancake although the table was booked for people coming in 20 minutes. Service ‚Ä¶"
114,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,a year ago,I came back to Amsterdam just for a day. My main priority was to try this place. I walked in and the guy told me they had reservations and they would be booked in about 15 minutes. They would serve me if I could eat fast. ‚Ä¶
115,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Pancakes we're good and the interior or the cafe is so cute. The stairs are extremely narrow and small.
116,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a gem. I'll definitely be back if/when I'm back in Amsterdam. Worth the wait!
117,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Call them right now and make a reservation.  This was amazing.  We both got savory pancakes, thinking we'd have room for a sweet one after.  Nope.  They were too big and delicious.  I had bacon in mine, and the bacon was cooked into the ‚Ä¶"

123,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cute spot, maybe a bit over hyped. The pancakes are delicious but more like crepes than ""American pancakes""."

127,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really great pancakes. A true original in the heart of Amsterdam. You have to climb a narrow steep way to find just a few seats in a cozy living room. Find a wide variety of savory and sweet pancakes (pannenkoeken). We‚Äôve had bacon with syrup and red wine pear with heavy whipped cream. Soooooo good.
128,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Pancakes we're good and the interior or the cafe is so cute. The stairs are extremely narrow and small.
129,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Interesting pancake savory combinations- quaint little pancake shop! Get here early or you won‚Äôt get seated for a long time.

132,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best pancakes in Amsterdam!!!! We had other pancakes in Amsterdam and these blew them away by far! You walk up some very vertical steep stairs and end up at this very tiny restaurant. We did not have reservations but were lucky enough to get seated within 10 minutes.
133,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Fun little restaurant. Make a reservation. It's the best pancakes to have in Nederland.
134,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Nothing special besides the place itself
135,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Purely tax fraud ! Never ever ! They claim that the PoS machine is broken, thus you need to pay cash. Besides this, they don‚Äôt give you a receipt, but only the order note upon our request. Disguisting pancakes with canned fruits from swindlers !"
136,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great pancakes and cute place, but really small. Only 3 tables are inside."

146,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So this is a small restaurant (the smallest in Europe) with only 4 tables, so make reservations ahead of time! However, if you have no choice but to come here as a walk-in, it's more than worth the wait. First, we climbed up a steep ‚Ä¶"
147,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Found this place on accident, and wow. Thank goodness for that. Had the most amazing crepe pancake in my life.

10 stars!"
148,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Outstanding food with the really cool novelty of the ""smallest restaurant in Europe"" vibe. If you're from the States, don't shy away from the savory pancakes. They are PHENOMENAL. Also, when they tell you to eat them the Dutch way with syrup, I would recommend. Very tasty."
149,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A sweet, intimate space with great pancakes.  Really nice staff.

But the need for making reservations was annoying, and I noticed a few tables ‚Ä¶"
150,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It is probably the smallest restaurant in Amsterdam. Very steep stairs welcome the visitors, but it is worth to climb them. In the small room you get served maybe the most delicious pancakes of Amsterdam. You can choose between sweet or ‚Ä¶"

153,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I made sure to visit this pancakehouse after seeing it on an episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and I am so glad I did. The pancakes were amazing! The place is really tiny and has a crazy set of stairs to climb up to get to the ‚Ä¶
154,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,6 months ago,What a great spot to eat a pancake for lunch. We had the window seat and enjoyed the people watching from above.
155,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This was okay, probably aimed at tourists, it's right on a main street. The staff where friendly and the service was fine. I found the pancakes too thick, but covered in enough syrup they went down well, I guess the style is how the Dutch like them. Finally, I would say the cost was on the high side."
156,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You will NOT be disappointed!  This is definitely one place YOU have to go!  The restaurant is very small, so be sure to get there when they open or you will wait for a table. ‚Ä¶"
157,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Incredibly tasty crepes and some creative flavors too! The vegetables were super fresh and the pancakes themselves were very tasty. Call ahead for a reservation - there are only four tables in the whole place.
158,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Pretty amazing that the food quality here is so good in the center of Amsterdam
159,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic place for savory or dessert pancakes. Make reservations!
160,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best homemade pancakes in Amsterdam. Your such wonderful hosts and thank you for putting maple syrup on my bacon and cheese pancake- it was a game changer. If you come here get the Brie honey and bacon pancake (Kai).
161,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Super narrow sitting space. And quite mediocre pancake for kind of a high price. Overrated
162,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 1 star ,a year ago,We had the chocolate banana pancake. The chocolate sauce was very sweet but not much chocolate flavor. I really didn‚Äôt enjoy it. For a 8‚Ç¨ pancake I expected more than that....
163,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing pancakes and super nice people!
164,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice and small restaurant for traditional pancakes. The staff is really quick and friendly here. Be prepared to get to make new friends here: There are only four tables and often you will be seated with unknowns. Because of the small amount of tables I recommend to reservate a table by phone a day before.
165,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best meal we had in Amsterdam. Truly worthwhile. Call and make a reservation as there are only 4 tables. Highly recommend the apple, cheese and bacon pancake and then add syrup at the table. Trust me on this - you won't regret it."
166,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So tiny, just 4 tables. The lady that served us was super friendly and very accommodating. The food was really good we cleaned out the plates. It‚Äôs best to call and reserve in advance because it‚Äôs rare to just come by and find an empty table. We learned the hard way but we‚Äôre lucky on the third time."

171,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely fabulous! As you probably know, seating is VERY limited. Don't be surprised or annoyed if a stranger is invited to sit by you by the host. There is very limited space and hopefully you can appreciate the host for helping those ‚Ä¶"
172,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Really good pancakes! It's a really small restaurant located up a steep flight of stairs. We got lucky and arrived right as another table was leaving. Many groups walked in after us and were told they had to wait. Calling ahead and making a reservation is recommended. Definitely recommend you visit this place on your trip to Amsterdam.
173,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"You have to try this place. Best pancakes I've ever had. Worth waiting to book a table as the place is small, but that gives it a cosy vibe."
174,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A must eat! These guys whip up the most delicious pancakes in a really unique attic setting. Reservations are advised but it is absolutely worth it for a sweet or savoury or both (I had the excellent apple, bacon and cheese). An experience you won't soon forget."
175,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Soooo Delicious!!  It was my first stop right off the plane for a late breakfast and it did not disappoint.  I highly recommend making reservations because there are a limited number of tables.  Also, good physical health is important ‚Ä¶"
176,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best pancakes I‚Äôve ever had! It‚Äôs a very small place but the level of service is huge. Its reservations only which makes sense; they only have 4 tables. It‚Äôs a must visit!!
177,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The pancakes were magnificent. Everyone should go here. Make a reservation in advance as they are small. Beautiful dining area in a great place. Go here. It's so worth it

184,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"literally the best pancake house in the world! every time I've been to Amsterdam I make sure to come here as much as I can. anytime a friend visits Amsterdam, it's at the top of my recommendations list. a steep climb up the stairs, but well worth it. make sure to make a reservation in advance!"
185,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute place and charming! Also very delicious pancakes. However this place is small so be ready to wait some time to be seated. It's worth the wait
186,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tiny pancake place with kettles hanging from the ceiling. The stairs are very steep, just in like other places in Amsterdam. Great pancake selection with both sweet and savory options. As it has only 4 tables there can be a bit of wait, but the turnaround is time is still decent, about 15-20 minutes."
187,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Dont let the steep stairs push you away, the pancakes are well worth the climb!

You can probably get in without reservations, if you're willing to wait 10-15 minutes, as people go in and out quite quickly."

189,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The sweetest most amazing people run this pancake üè†. It's a steep climb to the stop (especially if you have big bags) but it's most definitely worth it. The pancakes both sweet and savory are made with fresh ingredients and served with a dollop of magic. This place made me missing my bus to Brussels worth it
190,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best pancakes in Amsterdam, owner and staff are super friendly. Highly recommended!"
191,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"It was very beautiful!! Tiny but amazing, I definitely recommend to go there, we loved it"
192,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great pancakes! Their Kai special pancake with  bacon, brie and honey is to die for. Very cosy so either arrive at opening time or book else you may have to wait for the next serving slot which is every hour on the hour."
193,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place!  I've been here a few times and it never let's me down. Service is great always a smile. Only problem is what to get, but that's a good problem to have.  The thing to do is ask yourself what you like and have them help ‚Ä¶"

203,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I had the banana and honey pancake and it was delicious! Highly suggest you make reservations - they only have four tables and the first time we went, they were completely booked for the day (it was a weekend) so we reserved a table for Tuesday. It's cash only."
204,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Up a very steep flight of stairs and into a cozy room with four tables and dozens of teapots hanging from the ceiling. Service is warm and welcoming. Pancakes are tasty, though I imagine they're best plain (as was my intention, though I was wooed by the special strawberries and cream). A touristy and charming pitstop."
205,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The tiny place has only 4 tables but we came a bit after lunch time and only had to wait 40 minutes for a free slot. It feels a bit like being in someone's house (well, someone that is slighlty crazy) - but it is not the first place of that ‚Ä¶"
206,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had the bacon and cheese pancake. Excellent. Highly recommend. But get reservations or else risk long wait times as there are just a few tables.

I know it's probably not the worst thing but the stairs are hard to get up and down. I hit my head and it's a very small shop. I think you could maybe fit 15 customers at a time in there"
217,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A quite good pancake restaurant ! I ordered a bacon, cheese and apple pancake and it was super good. You should definetly come here to try !

220,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tiny place so get there early if you want to get a table, especially for a big group! But it‚Äôs well worth it. The pulled beef pancake was incredible!"

236,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This is the cutest place I visited. A cramped but cozy pancake shop hidden on the top of  crazy steep stairs. Nice people managing it and always full. We got a place without reservation and had a pancake with simple chocoltsirup. Yum!
237,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very rude service, ok food but nothing exceptional. The place is tiny,super crowded and accessible only through a steep staircase. Be adviced no cards are accepted which was not mentioned anywhere until the check was practically thrown on our table. Worst service during our stay in Amsterdam."
238,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely worth the wait. Make sure to book. They're only open from 12:00 to 18:00 (Sundays 17:00). Try Kai (Bacon, Cheese and Honey) and you will may be positively surprised (that you can love sweet and salty)."
239,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious pancakes in a delightful tiny shop sitting above a quaint street. Teapots line the ceiling for conversation and the service was fast , correct, abd polite. Only took cash when we were there; atm across the road at the bread shop."
240,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best Dutch pancakes in Amsterdam. It's a very small establishment and has very steep stairs. Only 5 tables so go early or be prepared to wait. It is 100% worth it.
241,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing home cooked crepes. Tiny place. Get a reservation if you're not going by yourself, otherwise you'll never get a table. If you go alone expect to be sat with other singles. Cash only!"
242,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great spot for a quick sweet bite. A good variety of pancakes to choose. But it's a small spot and reservations are very helpful
243,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Such a gem! Make reservations so early your head will spin because it't tiny. They only have ~5 tables and when they are full, they are full! The food was delicious and such warm Dutch hospitality. I loved going here and I will try to go back!"

245,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Excellent food. Hilariously small restaurant. I walked in without a reservation and they told me I could sit with someone else and I needed to eat in 15 mins. Some people might find this ridiculous but I thought it was amazing. Again excellent food. Worth the hike up the narrow staircase.
246,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely excellent pancakes. Awesome spot as well. Make sure you book as there are only four tables. Stair only access. Make sure you visit.
247,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing interior. The Pankaces are nice though nothing extraordinary. The staff was nice. Definitely book a table in advance. Would come again mainly because of the unique design.

251,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A very nice and small (only four tables) restaurant. First of all you need to do a reservation. Within the week you might pass by and get an appoinment in one or more hours. The prices are ok for Amsterdam and range between 7,50 ‚Ç¨ and 12,50 ‚Ç¨ for nice pancakes. The owner speeks German and English."
252,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had such a blast here. Make sure you make a reservation the day before. There are 4 or 5 tables and the owners are always near by. The food is tasty so stop in!
253,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Definitely take the steep stairs to this little gem! I have yet to try a pancake I don't love- sweet or savory. This is a non-negotiable must have when I am in Amsterdam.
254,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Unique, interesting and cute is what I would describe this pancakehouse. Only downside is that there is very limited space and in the summer it gets very hot. Pancakes were great aswell."
255,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I will say the best is the pancake dough, and the cozy vibe and decoration. However it is too pricy, the toppings are nothing special and the drinks (e.g. Hot chocolate is just chocomel taken from the microwave at 2,75 eur) if you haven't been there just one time is enough."
256,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent pancakes in a cute little restaurant. Go there for the experience and stay for the pancakes. One of the few places in the city that serves the original pancakes and retains the taste and authenticity.
257,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Loved this place! You have to check out their schedule because when we went it was only Fri-Sun but it was totally worth the walk back the next day.  It's so quaint, not an experience you'll get anywhere else and the decor is so adorable.  The food and the service are A+ it's a must go in Amsterdam."

270,Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This place is incrediable. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills went here. Believe me the stairs are so steep and there is only about 6 tables inside reservation is best.

The pancakes are so good here, that I now am banished to search the rest of the world for a place that can make a pancake that holds up to what Pannenkoekenhuis Upstairs has set the bar at, and they set the bar extremely high... BEST PANCAKES I'VE EVER HAD!!"
