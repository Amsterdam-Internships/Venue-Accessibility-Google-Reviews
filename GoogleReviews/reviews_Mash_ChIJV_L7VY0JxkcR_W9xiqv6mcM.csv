0,Mash, 4 stars ,a month ago,Nice food and very reasonable prices. As a suggestion you should turn the music down a little bit. The waiters will still have a good time and the customers will be able to talk without shouting.
1,Mash, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"As the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed for lunch, we found this little hidden gem in the Pijp. It is a small cosy restaurant with seating outside as well. We had the Pad Thai with chicken and the Spicy Rice Noodles with Tofu. Both ‚Ä¶"

24,Mash, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Unexpected reasonably authentic Thai food.
Friendly service."
25,Mash, 4 stars ,a year ago,The food was tasty and they have a diverse drink menu. The service was friendly but not too attentive - there was one person working at the front so you should consider having more staff on a Saturday night. Other than that had a great experience and would come again.

27,Mash, 5 stars ,a year ago,We ended up there for some late night drinks. We were 7 and the waitress made an awesome effort to accommodate us (considering Covid-19 and distances limitations). We got one table for 4 and one for 3 inside and we could still talk to each ‚Ä¶

36,Mash, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The thai food was very good. Coming from the us, I wasnt sure how this would be but the chicken pad thai was great. I asked for it to be a little more spicy and they gave me sauce which made the level of spiciness perfect. Fun atmosphere as well with nice bartenders."

42,Mash, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Looking like a bar, actually a great Thai restaurant. Too bad that they don""t claim more that they do Thai food. I had a Chicken Wok with usual vegetables, was big, was good, was fair price (12‚Ç¨), on a sunny terrasse at lunch was perfect. ‚Ä¶"
43,Mash, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the food! That chicken soup is just amazing, first time I tried it was like waaauwwwww! The food I tried was also very Thai (and I was just couple months back in Thailand and it just looks like the food I ate there!)"
44,Mash, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Not the best bar or Thai restaurant in town.  It tries but the taste is not there.  I think it's a little overpriced for what could be a normal in-the-corner bar. ‚Ä¶

53,Mash, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amaaazing Thai food. There's not many reviews on this place for some reason but i think that's because people don't approach it as a restaurant, but more like a bar. Well it's both and if your in Amsterdam De Ppipj area def give it a try!
finger licking good!!"
