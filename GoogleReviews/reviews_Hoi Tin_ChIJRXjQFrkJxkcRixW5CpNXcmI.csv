1,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Authentic Chinese restaurant, located in china town Amsterdam. If you like dim sum, you should really try out this place."
2,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great freshmade Dim sum, excellent taste and huge choice. It's an old fashioned restaurant with running, quick waiters who do see everything and will serve you at their best. The locals eat here. What can I say more."
3,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Arguably the best dim sum restaurant in Amsterdam. Don't be put off by the sparse interior! The staff are helpful and friendly, the selection extensive, and the dim sum are fantastic. I had the best xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in the ‚Ä¶"
4,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a month ago,Everytime i visit Amsterdam. I have to go there for lunch or for diner. They have a lot of authentic chinese meals there. And the dishes there are so delicious. i can recommend the noodle soup with cha sieuw and the dim sums. The service staff and the owner were so friendly and made a very good job!
5,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great dim sum place with friendly staff. The dough of the soup dumplings were on the thick side and I found the siew mai to be a little bland. However it‚Äôs hard to find good dim sum whilst overseas so if you need something to snack or a good meal this place is definitely worth checking out
6,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"They have too many things, some are good some are not. If you know what to choose beforehand, it's a good and affordable restaurant. The pricing is odd as well, the cucumbers with garlic cost the same as the dumplings."
7,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Good and affordable dim sum here, service are efficient."
8,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Great variety of dim-sum (steamed, fried, deep-fried, oven-baked, cooked). Lovely bakery, during COVID-times they renovated part of the restaurant, including the bakery area. Even if you don't dine in, it is worth to drop by and get some sweet or savoury buns or cakes from the bakery. Lovely place."
9,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm not used to these type of dishes and tastes so it wasn't for me, but it was an interesting experience. I was disappointed that the dim sum options had almost no chicken or vegetable options, it was mainly beef, pork and shrimp. ‚Ä¶"
10,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Pretty good dim sum although i prefer oriental city. The claypot dishes are tasty and similar to the ones i ate in guangdong. Best chinese bakery in Amsterdam. Highly recommend the cha siu bao, sesame ball and sausageroll. ‚Ä¶"
11,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"As a Chinese person, this is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the city. The staff is also very friendly and the place is beautiful and clean. I love sitting by the big windows with a view on the streets of Amsterdam. Good dumplings and noodles!"
12,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best places in Amsterdam to have authentic Chinese foods. They obviously reduced the seasoning and amount of spice to make the dishes taste more neutral but that doesn‚Äôt prevent us from enjoying the foods. Service was kind and foods came quickly.
13,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing place, loved it üòç the food is authentic Chinese and very tasty."
14,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We checked what was to offer in terms of Oriental cuisine down this street.

15,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"The most delicious and authentic Cantonese restaurant in Amsterdam, I love it here. My wife who is Chinese loves it too. Very friendly service and wonderful food."
16,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great hidden original Chinese restaurant well known for its delicious Dim Sum. Packed with Chinese, eating here makes you feel like you got lost during lunch time somewhere in Hong Kong. Waiters can be a bit rude if you don‚Äôt speak Chinese but don‚Äôt be intimidated by that. If you love good dim sum, I‚Äôd highly recommend this place."
17,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a week ago,"When are looking to eat great dim sum, this is the place in Amsterdam. For max 25 euro per person and you will full."
18,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"An easy to find location in Chinatown. Went there for lunch on weekend and the serving is fast. The xiaolongbao tastes well. However it‚Äôs quite strange they place it in the foil cup,  which makes it quite difficult to get the xiaplongbao ‚Ä¶"
19,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent place for lunch dumplings. Indeed the portions are huge so don't overestimate what you can eat when you're really hungry. Service and quality are great and prices are excellent.

21,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Unfortunately very average dim sum. We tried a lot across the menu but only the crispy chive pot stickers were ok. Was hoping for more, due to the good reviews but from a Chinese point of view the dim sum were were not well made."
22,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We were craving for authentic hk dim sum and so glad to find this place.  Servers were very polite and attentive.  There is a bakery in front and we were happy with the selection too.
23,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a year ago,The staff was amazing and super friendly.  They helped and checked up on us even without asking. The waiter was the sweetest gentleman we met in Amsterdam. A really must-go for dim sum lovers.
24,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"These guys know what they doing! We have been come here regularly and never get disappointed. They are serving Chinese food in HK style. We tried different meat dishes, seafoods and rices and they are one of the good one we had in ‚Ä¶"
25,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and honest Dim Sum - nice atmosphere and very nice food. It is the perfect spot for an informal and easygoing Sunday. They also have the bakery with an interesting selection of products you can buy after your meal.

28,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place to have a dinner. Big plates, fresh vegetables, everything was tasty, especially steamed sweet buns with lotus paste. Service is nice. Seems to be one of the best places for vegeterians across Amsterdam chinatown."
29,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Being ethnic Chinese myself and having tried really great Chinese gourmet, I'm quite picky when eating Chinese food overseas. Granted, it's not easy to get specific ingredients to recreate the authentic flavours. ‚Ä¶"
30,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"They have a nice dim sum menu, in addition to the usual items.  They also sell Chinese pastries."

36,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I always try to find the best dim sum whenever I travel abroad. Hoi Tin is a restaurant I found that definitely did not disappoint. This place can be hard to find if you‚Äôve never been here before. Just look for the display window selling ‚Ä¶
37,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Brilliant food served quickly. Quite rich. Good portions. A little pricey and drinks were tiny so not quite a 5 from me. Serve bigger drinks and then it would be perfect
38,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic food and friendly staff. When I was there, 80% of the guests were Chinese which is always a good sign. :) Highly recommended!"
39,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, good prices and nice people. Portions where a lot bigger than expected"
40,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Awesome food for a good price. I've been coming back here for many years and so has my family for a few generations. Lovely to see they have a terrace nowadays for the option to ""dine in"" during corona times. Recommended!"
41,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Quality compared to price is a big 10!!! definitely worth a visit here the food was outstanding
42,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderful quality dim-sum! Ive been to Hong Kong and China many times and enjoyed some of the best Cantonese food the world has to offer, and I must say How Tin in Amsterdam is one of the best I've ever had. Very fresh, made to order rather than pre-packaged. Friendly service as well."
43,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food are good. But just one thing bother me whole night which if I don‚Äôt say it out, I‚Äôm sorry for myself.

44,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Cosy and tasty. Packed with Chinese. Recommended if you are near Nieuwmarkt.
45,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was amazing they gave us our time by giving you a small pad to write down your order so take your time check out their food. Yummy
46,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,One of the very few places in Amsterdam where you can get your freshly baked Hong Kong pastries!
47,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We got some pork buns from their bakery and it was so so tasty. Definitely recommend!
48,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We stumbled upon this place after finding out the place we planned on going was closed. I was lured in by the smell of dim sum and Chinese baked goods, and my nose did not let me down. Excellent food for a really great price, and great service too!"
49,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A great place to eat Chinese. Good food. Very friendly Chinese staff.

52,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good qualit end nice eat.the chinese man very Good. thank's
53,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We wanted cheap and cheerful and that‚Äôs what we got. Equal parts ghetto & authentic, no smoking signs all over the joint, toilets feel like a Chinese back alley. Foods acceptable for what you pay and hits the umami cravings."
54,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,a month ago,Really not tasty. Very expensive for that
55,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very transitional canton gourmet, very tasty."
56,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is ok - a bit greasy. At first the waiters at the door thought there were only two of us and said they were fully booked, but then they realised we were a group of eight and seated us right away. There were plenty of tables in the back. Don't like being lied to. Quick service once we were seated.  Serving waiters are friendly."
57,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Traditional and good food, friendly service and affordable prices"
58,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This was the first time when I tried dim sum and dumplings. I found it very tasty and delicious. The place offers a lot of variety of foods in reasonable price. I can offer this place to the everyone. I give only four stars as we needed to wait a lot between the dishes.
59,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,a year ago,"We ordered Dumplings with pork. They served us Dumplings with pork and shrimps. Not a big deal for the most of you, but my girlfriend is highly allergic to seafood. The reaction of the waiter: He brought us the bill (full price!) and ‚Ä¶"
60,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Over all good Chinese food. Just no fan of the dumplings.
61,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely food! I feel home here all the time. I'm from the Canton region where these food came from. I love the original flavor, the freshness of the ingredients (including some commonly seen Chinese ingredients but rarely seen here in NL), ‚Ä¶"
62,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super tasty dumplings - I most especially liked their phoenix claw (chicken feet). I know Westerners might not like it but the Asian in me is celebrating as it‚Äôs the closest authentic Asian food I can find! They also sell some fresh buns ‚Ä¶
63,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very authentic. Can‚Äôt ask for more.
64,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurant. The foods is very delicious and tasty. It's authentic, and it is spicy when it said so. Very recommended. The dim sum also taste very good, it's not like other places that just heat it from the frozen foods you get in the supermarket."
65,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great, authentic Cantonese food!"
66,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I would give the restaurant 3 stars (great selection but taste-wise I know much better places for dim sum), but the Chinese bakery at the storefront deserves 5 stars and is a must whenever I visit Amsterdam."
67,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A place of beauty. Dim Sum was delicious.
68,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Went here for a dinner with a group of 4. We had soup and 2 main dishes to share. Overly I would say it's good considering the area. They are definitely quick to serve. You have city center price but the food is quite decent. The staff is ‚Ä¶
69,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super yummy and authentic Chinese food! It may look a little old and not as modern as other restaurant in Chinatown, but the food and the staff are all the better. I can only recommend to eat there, if you happen to be in/close to Chinatown Amsterdam. The prices are also fine, since the food is REALLY delicious!"
70,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I always hunt for good food especially dumplings and Netherlands is one of the place where I always get good dumpling. Chinatown is the best place. Hoi Tin has not vast spread but decently good dumplings like hacao, buns, sticky rice. For a single traveller it might be too much but I really like it. Its value for money and decent place."
71,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I have never tried the actual restaurant but every time I am around I feel the need to get a piece of the pastry they have at the storefront. They are cheap and awesome, come in multiple flavors and stuffings and most of them are tasty. Around 1-1.5‚Ç¨ each. So good."
72,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Typical raw traditional old style Chinese feel where things have been standing still for the past 30 years - don't go there for the style or decor but for the food that was good, also traditional, but not up there with the very best Chinese I've had. Definitely worth a visit.
Prices are fair."
73,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I took dimsum, some are quite ok but some not my taste."
74,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,a year ago,Very rude experience today. I was first not served as someone came in after and then I was shoved out the door. Pastries are ok but not great as I've had then before but service has gone from bad to atrocious.
75,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely food but read the menu carefully before ordering. My vegetarian dish detailed as Chinese vegetables in oyster & garlic sauce turned out to be a fair portion of Pak Choi. Nothing else!! Apparantely I should have ordered Chinese mixed vegetables further down on the menu. Lesson learnt!
76,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I think that BUNQ should introduce a weekly spending limit for Chinese pastries and cakes since I‚Äôm addicted by their fresh pastries. Lived in London, and the pastries here remind me of home."
77,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Although primarily a restaurant, this place also offers house made pastries such as custard tarts and sweet and savoury buns.  You can just pop in the door to buy one or a whole box full.  The staff are very polite and kind and hygienic. ‚Ä¶"
78,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Deliciouse food if you want a taste of China! Very flavourfull and we love the spicy chilli sauce aswell! We ordered the chinese donut with soy sauce, the ginger pudding (if youre troat hurts, eat this!), white wide noodle soup with Cha Siu, and the savoury salty egg buns. These were my favourite. The service was ok..."
79,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good and pretty legit Chinese food.
80,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good and delicious Dim Sum! Friendly and fast service from waiters! The only thing changed here is that you have to pay ‚Ç¨1.75 for a pot of Poh Li Chinese tea! In the past the chinese tea always come free with the Dim Sum you ordered! I should know because I have eaten here more than 30 years in Amsterdam!
81,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place to eat. The quantity is impressive. Good way to spend your hard earned buck. The service was quick. Central location. From the outside you don't give it much but I assure you it's good.
82,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We've been to Hoi Tin for many years now and they are the only Cantonese restaurant in town who always deliver the same quality. Very homey dishes and very well priced. They are not the best but certainly not the worst. The food is cooked ‚Ä¶
83,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Now,  in the middle of Old Town, is the peace of Buddha. You can not take pictures inside, however, a lovely place to visit and learn something positive in the teachings of Buddha.  I was so pleasantly surprised. The building stands out, yet their side buildings blended in with the historical buildings of the area."
84,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is by far my favourite restaurant in Amsterdam. I go there every time I visit, it's a bit of a tradition and the food is amazibg every time. They have great tea and home made ice tea and the salt & pepper chicken is to die for! Looove it!"
85,Hoi Tin, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We bought Chinese breadsticks / Youtiao and they looked fine on the outside, but when we cut them at home, they were practically brown and grey! Most probably fried in old used filthy oil. Such a disappointment. We had to throw out all three. The other pastry was fine. Our lunch was not bad as well."
86,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,a month ago,Excellent duck! Friendly service.
87,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"As a Hongkonger who lives in NL, the food there is just so-so and price is quite high comparing with other Cantonese DimSum restaurants in Amsterdam, there are alot of other better options in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
88,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wide arrange on the menu. Authentic Dim Sum and whenever I have my crave for Sui Kau soup, I got to Hoi Tin to take it way. For a huge a bowl with noodles and plenty of the Sui Kau you only pay ‚Ç¨10,- (count on bringing the rest in a doggy bag)"
89,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The place was decent for its price, though a good atmosphere was really missing: no music,  a bit crowded and hectic waiters. One of our side dishes was significantly delayed. The food was good but nothing really special"
90,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's very delicious chinese food just like in China. The staff is also very polite and shows a lot of hospitality. On top it's not expensive. We had a great time.
91,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Fair prices and great if you like Cantonese.
92,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The sui kau and wonton noodles is tasteless! They don't even know how to make a dry one (saprate from the soup) should have some soya,oyster sauce with it so basic also can't make it? Won't come back here for noodle's!"
93,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,4 years ago,Went in. Nice starter. (No one else in at this point) Complained about waiting an hour. Other Chinese customers were served before us even though we'd already ordered. (Favourtism) complained after being brought a pile of Pak choi instead ‚Ä¶
94,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The quality of the dimsum and the cakes never disappoint. Been coming there for years. Chatty and friendly staff. The restaurant is a bit dated but I'm happy to trade that off for the high food quality.
95,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Used to be our favorite chinese restaurant in Amsterdam. Recently the quality level has dropped, prices have gone up and the waiters have been replaced by some extremely rude waiters. No more Hoi-Tin for us!"
96,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food portion size is massive and was good for the price. Hungry buz must come here. Have to try the ""pork with aubergine hotpot"", burn your tongue, but you want more."
97,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Extremely rude service!

The food was fine but the service was the worst I've ever experienced. The ‚Ä¶"
98,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,2 years ago,Worst Chinese Restaurant. Believe that people who rated 3 stars and above never try actual and proper chinese cuisine. With the price you pay it does not worth a penny. ‚Ä¶
99,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Some authentic Chinese food. Great taste, very friendly and quick service and not too expensive. I ate too much tho, it was that good..."
100,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Dim sum was good, but not great.  Rice noodles were too thick and the spring rolls were a tad greasy."
101,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Yummy food! And nice staff I'm a big fan of chili and they have us 5 of the most delicious chili I ever had. Loved this restaurant would definitely go back.
102,Hoi Tin, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"You can go ahead and claim that this place is an oriental Chinese restaurant but in my opinion it is just a plate of depression with a chewy texture, thick sauce and overnight feeling. My food was just very sad, small, filled with rice and lacked taste."
103,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Solid Chinese restaurant in the middle of Amsterdam - I'll be coming back. I shared the prawn dumpling, scallop dumpling, ma pao tofu and broccoli with garlic sauce. All were very tasty"
104,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Are you looking for good Chinese food? then you should visit this original Chinese cuisine! try to learn how the Chinese people eat..it is much better then order a each person dish.! share 2 or 3 different dishes ! ‚Ä¶
105,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Used to be a better chinese restaurant. Don't come here that often anymore, only when friends/family want to. They use a lot of oil to cook. The food shines. If you have plans to go out after dinner and you don't have strong stomach, be ‚Ä¶"
106,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If you said you are rooting for HK protest, the waiter will make sure you feel like hell by their insulting words. And he brought up the question himself in the beginning. Such a disrespectful place! They asked my Cantonese friend to clean ‚Ä¶"
107,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,2 years ago,If you said you rooting for HK protest. The waiter will make sure you feel like hell by  their insulting words. And he brought up the question himself in the very beginning!!!  Such a evil place. Asking all the people not to come if they don‚Äôt apologize to their ridiculous behavior!
108,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Can't forget eyes of the owner when I asked honey for my tea LMAO.
He said ""you are not Chinese"". Indeed, I am not LOL."
109,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is OK, price is good, nice Dim Sum. I go here mainly when with large parties because they have lots of room and the typical big round tables. Nice people."
110,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"The place is in the chinatown street along with many other chinese resturants, but being a ""true"" chinese resturant you must know what to order: my advice is to get there with some friends and order 4 or 5 different plates to taste ‚Ä¶"
111,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Looks shabby, but is infact one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to.
Food was fantastic and the service welcoming. highly recommend"
112,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice Chinese restaurant. Very homely. Good spread of Cantonese cuisine, and taste rather authentic too. Sold pastries as well but didn't try it."
113,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tasty food and attentive stuff. Food portions are BIG, we shared one meal for two persons and we were full. Recommended!"
114,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"It doesn't get more genuine than this place around Amsterdam China Town. The people from Hoi Tin don't do concessions to European tastes. This is the taste of China. And I've been there :-) But can anybody tell me... The staff's grumpy attitude, is  that genuinely Chinese too? Why are these people never ever friendly here?"
115,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As someone from Hong Kong, I was delighted to find a restaurant with authentic Cantonese dishes. I ordered the barbecued pork (cha sieuw) and stir fried broccoli with beef."
116,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"For 30 euros, the portions were good and quality beats most Chinese restaurants in Europe bar London."
117,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice restaurant and delicious authentic Chinese food. They have a friendly staff. Great !
118,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If you put a political mindset on the food, it doesn't taste as much as tasty. Every customer has their right to choose where they're going to stand for."
119,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little place where you can get authentic Hong Kong food.
Staff is friendly and very helpful. Restaurant is nice and clean"
120,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best authentic Chinese restaurant in Amsterdam!

122,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Nice dim sum assortment! Price is good and the also have a small bakery! Good bread as well. ‚Ä¶
123,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is ok not expensive but boy are the staff unfriendly. Must be a Chinese thing as they struggled in both Dutch and English, but the Chinese people in there had no trouble. Not on my must do again list."
124,Hoi Tin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Their staff insult guests who potentially have different political views. I'd not eat here if I had other choices. Oh btw, food wasn't impressive."
125,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's been ages since I visited Hoi Tin, but this time with a Chinese guest of mine. We returned several times and both enjoyed scrumptious and affordable meals."
126,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Wide variety of tasty and authentic dim sum at a good price. Must try the pan fried water chestnut dessert and egg tarts.
127,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food. We took the shared menu for 22,50eur per person. Everything was delicious. We will definately go back."

129,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Dim sum in quite a big portion. Acceptable quality but not fine dim sum. No frill restaurant with average food quality. Average price.
130,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice dish
131,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice authentic Hong Kong vibe and good here. Be sure to sit at the front of the restaurant (enter, go left) because sitting at the back is not half as nice."
132,Hoi Tin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The best ever chinese cuisine I have ever tasted! Very friendly waiter always ready for your requests.

138,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food is DELICIOUS!!!!!! Very very nice! Will visit again on my next trip
139,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely ambience but the food took quite a while, when it finally arrived it was pretty bland and oily. Wouldn‚Äôt go there again."
140,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Mango chicken was nice however the quantity of rice served was less as compared to other neighboring chineese restaurant and it was not warm.
141,Hoi Tin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food great, service excellent,  the only reason for 4 stars is that for 2 glasses of tap water they charged 1.6 euro for each!"
142,Hoi Tin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Not bad but felt let down by how chicken was bit chewy to eat and inside was not how I thought it be as walked though kitchen and waited to be lead in thinking have I came through wrong door lol...lack of decor inside felt like I wasn't in Chinese restaurant.
