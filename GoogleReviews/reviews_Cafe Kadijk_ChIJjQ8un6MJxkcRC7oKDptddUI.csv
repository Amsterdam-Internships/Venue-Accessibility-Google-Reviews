0,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,a month ago,Service is super helpful and friendly. Food is amazing. Love the interior. A wonderful gem outside the noise of the Red Light. All around top place to eat.
1,Cafe Kadijk, 1 star ,a month ago,"Really wanted to like it, but it did not live up to expectations at all.. the portion of the Indonesian plate was generous, and the flavours were good, but both the meats were severely overcooked. The rice was undercooked and grainy, and the cracker was soggy and flat."
2,Cafe Kadijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Well priced and very authentic, tasty and spicy Indonesian food. Atmosphere very laid back and easy. ‚Ä¶"
3,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I've had dinner here on several occasions, and I've never been disappointed by the experience. Their food is fantastic, one of the best Indonesian places in the city by far. I've had many of their main courses, and there's really nothing ‚Ä¶"
4,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely delicious food! I'm not gonna lie, I don't really have a clue what I ate on the mixed plate, (although I definitely had tofu satay - yum!!) But everything was so tasty! Our waitress was really helpful as we tried to order quite a ‚Ä¶"
5,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is the first restaurant I've found that serves beef rendang and it was delicious. The flavors we're outstanding and just the right amount of spice. The amtoaphere of the restaurant was perfect you. From the ecletic open-air environment to the Bob Marley on the speakers, it felt like a beach side local gem."
6,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really amazing food here. Small little restaurant with big portions. We were stuffed after eating. Tunes were great and we really enjoyed ourselves. Super close to a smaller town vibe. Loved it and would recommend 10/10 times.
7,Cafe Kadijk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I thought the restaurant was pretty soso. They have a cute interior and a nice outdoor terrace but their food is overpriced and definitely below average. ‚Ä¶
8,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, very comfortable. They have nice food, well made and tasty. I think they precook the meals, but this does not affect the quality. Friendly staff and some background music are also included."
9,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite Indonesian caf√©/restaurant in Amsterdam. Nice prices, delicious food. You can‚Äôt reserve a table so if you want to have a dinner there try to go a bit early, sometimes is full."
10,Cafe Kadijk, 3 stars ,a year ago,Big portions but not everything was delicious. I didn‚Äôt like meat honestly but appetizers were good.
11,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Small, but beautifully cozy space ‚Äî makes for an amazing atmosphere. The Indonesian plate was fantastic. Drinks are reasonably priced."
12,Cafe Kadijk, 3 stars ,a year ago,"I guess you could say it‚Äôs an attempt at making Indonesian food ‚Äúmore chic‚Äù, hence the food is nicely made but also not quite what you‚Äôd consider top quality Indonesian cuisine, and certainly not composed along what goes with what. The ‚Ä¶"

15,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very small, but awesome Indonesian food with nice bar, good beers!"
16,Cafe Kadijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very friendly and welcoming. Good Indonesian food, reasonably priced, -all things considered. While the place was 2/3 full and service was a little slow, their hospitality made up for (most of ) it. Some local beers on tap. Restrooms on premises. I would recommend."
17,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such an unusual restaurant and something I would never imagine would be so good. It‚Äôs small and cosy and you would never expect it to serve food so delicious. There were 7 of us and we sat along the bar and at a small table. We ordered ‚Ä¶

21,Cafe Kadijk, 3 stars ,a year ago,The food it's a bit overpriced in comparison to the same cuisine restaurants. The dishes are tasty and have a decent size. Service it's just okay and the beer it's not as could as supposed to be. Nothing amazing about the place nor the meal.

28,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved the food.  Good friendly service.  Went back later in our trip as my wife liked the meatball appetizer so much.  The Indonesian plate is a nice sampler.  Upstairs the first night was a little hot, but the waitress opened the window. ‚Ä¶"

30,Cafe Kadijk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"There are many claims either online or in travel guides that this is one of the top restaurants in Amsterdam. Don't be taken in by these. The food is fine,but nothing special. I've had much better Indonesian food in many different ‚Ä¶"
31,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"FANTASTIC food and service. Girlfriend and I came here because I read a reddit recommendation, and boy did it pay off. We got the chicken and lamb satay and it. Was. Fantastic. We devoured them in no time. Definitely recommend for Indonesian food."
32,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A bit of the beaten track this is near the maritime museum. It is a small bar with a small number of tables on a mezzanine. One person runs the bar and table service while another is in the tiny kitchen. The menu is not extensive  but the ‚Ä¶
33,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Bottom line - this is a must try place, with excellent coffee as a bonus surprise! ‚Ä¶"
34,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great food. Spices have wonderful flavour and it's not just spicy for the sake of spiciness. Don't take the spices lightly though. Some dishes will make your mouth heat up.  The shrimp chips are also awesome.
35,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"By far my favorite little restaurant and cafe in Amsterdam, I come here at least a few times a month. Delicious indonesian and authentic food (from ‚ÄòBea‚Äô). The personal is young and happy. Besides food also great for having drinks and Dutch (draft) beers."
36,Cafe Kadijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A cafe-restaurant with nice Indonesian food. I'm not an Indonesian food connoisseur but I try to eat it wherever I am in the Netherlands and the rest of the world and Cafe Kadijk is a place I keep coming since 2006. Solid-good, a bit pricey ‚Ä¶"
37,Cafe Kadijk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If the restaurant is closed earlier than 1am, thanks to inform us in advance. Went there at 11.30pm and no food was available, and it was raining. ‚Ä¶"
38,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,De-lish. Our server was super nice and welcoming. Ordered the meatball app which was pretty good but what absolutely tickled my fancy was the Indonesia plate and chicken satay...make you say heeeeyyyy! Nice area with pleasant view of some of this city's beautiful architecture.
39,Cafe Kadijk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food! You can't book so you just show up and hope they have a free spot for you, which isn't great. One of the waitresses had attitude, which wasn't great either üòí"
40,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing foood! We ordered chicken wings and Satay Amay along with the draft wheat beer. The place has Greta food and the staff was super warm and friendly.

45,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Come in and ask to try something you haven‚Äôt had before. We had the mackerel app, for instance. Not just spicy. Plenty of heat but also loaded with flavor. The staff helpful and just plain cool. A really fun hour."
46,Cafe Kadijk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We came here because somebody said it was the best Indonesian food he ever ate. We were with a rather large group, the place was packed so we sat outside. We were served 3 kind of meat, spicy hicken, sweet beef and spicy beef. The food was ‚Ä¶"

48,Cafe Kadijk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is really so-so, dumbed-down indonesian food, i expected much better rendang than what was served here. The soto soup was good though. All in all this doesn‚Äôt come close to being interesting enough for a second visit."
49,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Fantastic Indonesian food!
50,Cafe Kadijk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I was referred here by a coworker who had visited Amsterdam in October. The night we tried to dine here, it appeared to be closed for renovations or due to some other type of work.

51,Cafe Kadijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great find, out of the tourist area and food and staff are fab"

58,Cafe Kadijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Cool and very local Indonesian caf√© located in a a really quint plein at the end of the Nieuwe Herengracht - great to watch the locals pass by. I lived around the corner for three years and I love the spot (just please respect it!).
