0,The Taste of Vietnam, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Food was delicious. Wish there were more meat on the plates though. Almost too many veggies for the portion of meats you get. Food tasted great though and staff were friendly

13,The Taste of Vietnam, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"I keep giving it a chance, the broth in the pho was better years ago. Now it is flavorless and tastes like tap water. The broth is the most important part. So disappointed"
14,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"A taste of Vietnam is a great restaurant with fantastic service.

19,The Taste of Vietnam, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"I had the Pho Dac Biet.
The broth was on the sweet side and had a lemon taste.

22,The Taste of Vietnam, 3 stars ,10 months ago,This is the first time I‚Äôve tried to dine in this place. Their pho was just fair. I know this is really difficult to recreate the original flavor that Pho is famous for. The broth still smelled of ‚Äútoo beefy‚Äù and was not clear enough. It ‚Ä¶

26,The Taste of Vietnam, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We used to love this restaurant. We‚Äôd go regularly. We noticed the owner was not very friendly. Then the quality of the food slipped, and we saw the owner less and less. The last three times we went prior to Covid the whole family agreed-we ‚Ä¶"

29,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A nice little place set off a main street. The fried egg rolls are amazing, flaky and fresh. The PO  soup is always great. Good value portions.

31,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôve been here twice, couldn‚Äôt help get the beef pho again. Fresh spring rolls, crispy shrimp rolls crispy and tofu noodles with beef were all v good too. Friendly staff, no frills decor, clean. Worth the 20 minute drive. Will come back."
32,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was a new discovery for me. Went with a friend and we really enjoyed it. She had pet died and I had Curry. Excellent food. And our waitress was really friendly and helpful. I'm going back as soon as I can.

37,The Taste of Vietnam, 4 stars ,4 months ago,This experience was very good. Good food and clean.
38,The Taste of Vietnam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Well, for one of the few Vietnamese restaurants around here, it's not horrific. Lowell has much better pho than here, more flavorful and better portions. But for a quick fix, not bad. I just prefer to drive an extra 25 minutes to go eat well, because good food makes me happy"
39,The Taste of Vietnam, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Serious lack of flavor, no authenticity to food. This is not the taste of Vietnam."
40,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fresh and authentic Vietnamese food! We love everything here. The crispy eggplant, the ginger duck, and the pho are just incredible. What an amazing chef this place has with a very subtle and personal touch! And the service is absolutely perfect."
41,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,So delicious!! The Canh Chua was amazing! The pork vermicelli was completely unbelievable! I was not expecting the traditional pork in there.

42,The Taste of Vietnam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Happened upon this restaurant trying to find a quick lunch.

45,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I read these crazy reviews that these people write of how good this place is and I was like I never see a restaurant with so many reviews and the lowest rating is a 3 star.  And after I ate there.  I knew it is a quality restaurant.  The ‚Ä¶

47,The Taste of Vietnam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Always friendly whether sitting to eat or taking to go, very tidy and cozy dining room. ‚Ä¶"
48,The Taste of Vietnam, 1 star ,3 years ago,If I could give this a negative score I would. The pho was terrible. The broth was greasy and just tasted absolutely horrible. I guess the spring rolls weren't too bad but my friend had ordered a sparkling lemonade and I ordered a regular one. We both got sparkling which tasted weird. Overall crappy experience and will not be returning
49,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really liked their crispy eggplant. It had a nice sweet savory flavor. I followed this up with their beef pho. Thin succulent slices of beef in a flavorful broth. Have it with basil and jalape√±os, will make your day. Fast and friendly service. Overall a very enjoyable dinner experience."
50,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Their muscles appetizer is my favorite, with grilled pork over rice or vermicelli."
51,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food  is wonderful! We eat here @ least once a week. The Pho is great, as is everything on the menu. The food is always fresh & delicious, & the servers are very friendly & accommodating. We highly recommend them."
52,The Taste of Vietnam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was pretty good. We had pho and the New Zealand clam appetizer. Both tasted good. The clams were spicy, but not too much for me. The pho didn't have tripe or tendon but the broth had great flavor."
53,The Taste of Vietnam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A solid choice for pho and other Vietnamese dishes if you're in the area. Quick service and friendly staff. The spring rolls were delicious, but the pho was very average and a little bland."
54,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This small vietnamese is located in a little strip of stores in Leominster MA.    When I approached it I confess I was sceptical despite the good reviews I'd read.  It's definitely not a looker from the exterior.  We were not dissuaded, ‚Ä¶"
55,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best Canh Chua soup I've had in a long time. The place is small but cozy and the service is excellent. My wife and I also tried the Pad Thai and it was delicious! We highly recommend this restaurant!!
56,The Taste of Vietnam, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"As a vietnamese growing up in vietnam, I don‚Äôt really like the vietnamese food here that much. Maybe they adjust the recipe so food can be familiar to westerners here. I tried pho here twice, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll try the third time unless I‚Äôm ‚Ä¶"

61,The Taste of Vietnam, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It was okay, I suppose. My companion had Pad Thai and it was good enough albeit short on shrimp. My Ph·ªü was a disappointment - the beef balls were rubbery and the broth was weak. At least the basil and bean sprouts were fresh and crisp. ‚Ä¶"
62,The Taste of Vietnam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The crispy eggplant was great; the pho was only average.  It needed the meat on the side and more flavor in the broth.  But, it was inexpensive and the service was good, so I'll be back to try something non-pho."
63,The Taste of Vietnam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We go here for dinner once a month. The staff is the nicest group of people!  The food is fantastic. It can get a little loud when its packed, and the parking lot can fill up - but thats just proof of how much people enjoy A Taste of Vietnam."

69,The Taste of Vietnam, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty good Chinese food, which was not what I was looking for, but they don't have many traditional Vietnamese dishes on the menu. I had fried rice and my friemd had Pad Thai, which he said was good."
