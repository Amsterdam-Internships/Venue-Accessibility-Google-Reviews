0,Regular & Jack, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,Simple bar with good cocktails!
1,Regular & Jack, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a US-themed bar, like a traditional American Sports Bar in which you can sit up and enjoy wings whilst watching a game, or retire to the upstairs room in which football plays in larger screens. ‚Ä¶"
2,Regular & Jack, 5 stars ,a month ago,Fantastic pub for a drink and watching the football üëè
3,Regular & Jack, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Awesome spot for hot dogs lovers. Excellent bar staff. Place to go!
4,Regular & Jack, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Called in during a snowy date in December.  Very quirky little bar serving excellent food. Sat upstairs at a table with a central beer pump which would have been great fun if we weren't driving later.  Nachos to share were huge and very tasty local sharing platter.
5,Regular & Jack, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice service, nice pull pork, good beer.... Nice stop on my way to yet another museum:)"

12,Regular & Jack, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The nachos are delicious and good for two or more people. At the time I was there it was a football match and of course a lot of noise, but since this is a sports bar this is as expected. Once we ordered we were told that our table was ‚Ä¶"
13,Regular & Jack, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and the bartender was so kind with us.
14,Regular & Jack, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I had a really negative experience at this place with an insanely grumpy bar owner. If he thinks you are a tourist (I‚Äôm not, I live close by) he treats you like trash. ‚Ä¶"
15,Regular & Jack, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An absolutely wonderful pub in the city centre of Amsterdam. It's ideal place for meeting with friends, as the food and the drinks are awesome. Also if you're a sports person you can easily watch huge sports events like Premier League, Champions League, Volleyball, Basketball, Motor sports, Tennis etc."
16,Regular & Jack, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely place and welcoming staff! The cocktails are well prepared
17,Regular & Jack, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to stop for a beer and some familiar food. Great staff and good music.
18,Regular & Jack, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Super sports bar with a wide variety of mixed drinks that are dangerously easy to drink. Large spaces for groups, I think the upstairs can be privatized - perfect spot for a casual birthday party. And the best bar food in the city. Wings, nachos, waffle fries - yum!"
19,Regular & Jack, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The drinks tasted pretty good and the Ambiente was nice, but the waiter was impolite and the cocktails were overproced and small. I know that with the location of the bar I can not expect cheap prices but the ratio was indeed off. Finally I got to point out that the music was far to loud to the point were it only annoyed us."
20,Regular & Jack, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice bar, nice bartenders with typical Amsterdam prices.
Plenty more seating upstairs with a pool table hidden away.
Lots of sports on various TV's dotted about"

22,Regular & Jack, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nachos and fries were tasty however the guy who served us was miserable.
23,Regular & Jack, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there for dinner and to watch American football.  They didn‚Äôt have anything on the memu besides Chicken Satay.  No burgers, ribs, hotdogs or chicken wings.  No soap in the bathroom either. Waitress left us halfway through our ‚Äúdinner‚Äù ‚Ä¶"
24,Regular & Jack, 1 star ,3 years ago,Bartender was so drunk (saw him taking shots) that he accused me and my friend of leaving without paying (after we paid the other bartender) and made us miss the last tram of the evening. We had to walk all the way home. Very unprofessional. Pub is fine BUT if you‚Äôre looking for cocktails DO NOT COME HERE.
25,Regular & Jack, 1 star ,3 years ago,Nice ambience but very unfriendly staff that confuses drinks and forces to order plus the prices are unreasonably high. There are better places to spend the evening only the arctic temperatures forced us inside! ‚Ä¶
26,Regular & Jack, 4 stars ,a year ago,Cool sports bar. Friendly staff and a good beer selection. Enjoyed the bar food. Bitterballs and mustard were great!
27,Regular & Jack, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Expensive. Badest toilet facilities ever (1 for gents and girls, on a total capacity of 250 pax). Your strongly advised not to drink beer, as consequently will have to go at one moment in the near future. ;-)"
28,Regular & Jack, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I was insanely disappointed. When we entered we thought that the atmosphere was very welcoming, though we noticed that the staff was utmost overworked and unfriendly. Regarding the high prices, I would definitely NOT recommend the bar.
#Satan was our Barkeeper"
29,Regular & Jack, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice bar with some decent beers. But you are paying 8.5 EUR for a pint if you're getting something like a Weis beer, so not great value."
30,Regular & Jack, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Disappointing experience. I came here to assist a football match that was promoted in the page but the staff had no idea about it. They suggested me to go to another bar due they were planning only rugby matches. The match was Argentina Russia.
31,Regular & Jack, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A cool bar with baseball mits for lamp shades and beer taps on large tables, however, my boyfriend got food poisoning from their caesar salad... Great place for some casual drinks though."

34,Regular & Jack, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A little nugget, young barman is a class act. Sit outside on the PORCH and watch the world pass by.... many clubbers pass on the way to club NYX down the street, so great way to people watch . Little coffee house across the street too!!"
