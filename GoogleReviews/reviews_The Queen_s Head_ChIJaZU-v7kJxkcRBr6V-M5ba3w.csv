1,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our bartender was Pim, and as a first time guest here...he treated us very well. He had great liquor knowledge & his drinks were portioned greatly. I truly appreciate the hospitality from the whole entire staff here. Please if you’re new to …"

3,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love this place! Relaxing and cosy. There is a place downstairs that ou sit next to the water and its amazing!
4,The Queen's Head, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great bar, drinks and prices all very good. I wanted to give it 5 star but couldn’t sadly. It would of been good if the bar staff could interact more with customers instead of just the regulars. Was a bit sad that there wasn’t an event on a Saturday evening."
5,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been there on a Friday and the performers were amazing! Cheap drinks, good audience and the staff works very well."
6,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I can highly recommend this place as interior design is lovely and prices are very affordable. Barman who served us was professional and friendly.

8,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had such an amazing night on Saturday at the Drag Show. Best Drag I’ve seen! We are traveling in from LA, couldn’t believe we had the luck to stumble into such an amazing bar. Daniel (bartender) took care of us, he was almost as wonderful as the performers ;)"
9,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Went in together with my girlfriend for one beer but ended up staying until closing time. Great and welcoming guests and staff. Leon, the owner and bartender, goes the extra mile for his guest and was very caring. Recommend and will come back (yes, the bar is great for straight people as well)"
10,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing bar in central Amsterdam! Jakko in particular was super fun and helpful as we’re fairly new to the area. Welcoming staff, great drinks and wicked vibe. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a good time x"
11,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really fun gay bar! Nice and fun campy decorations, now and then they have a drag DJ play campy 80's disco. And they're really friendly, also to hetero visitors. So these people set the perfect example! Nice!"
12,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice cocktails, music is good. Guest but also the staff are really nice and make you feel welcome. Thank you Pim for the amazing Sunday’s"
13,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice bartenders. Beautiful bar.
14,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We love Daniel! We landed just an hour before stumbling into the city and came ordered a drink and got amazing service! Daniel was so sweet! Also the music is TO DIE FOR. An absolute must if you are in Amsterdam!!!
15,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff was lovely, the drinks were tasty, the show was entertaining and the prices are reasonable. I am so definitely returning to this place on my next trip to Amsterdam."
16,The Queen's Head, 3 stars ,6 years ago,This gay dive breathes the Amsterdam centre charm with it's campy-ish interior and the great canals view from their smoking room. The crowd is usually 30+ and mostly male. Staff is generally friendly although on busy nights you may have to wait longer to order.
17,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Always a great place to chill with friends or see some of the best drag entertainers in Amsterdam. Daniel and the bar staff are always attentive and welcoming too! Would recommend.
18,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best music, best bartenders, best night. This place is exactly what you want for a fun night out without the bs. Great energy and vibe. Can’t wait to come back!! Daniel is thee best 😉"
19,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute bar and the decor is opulent and fun.  We had amazing drinks and the bartenders were very social and friendly.  I’ll definitely be back when I’m in Amsterdam again!! 💃✈️
20,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great, friendly bar with some fun drag. Staff and customers are all very welcoming and you can feel the community in the bar. Well worth going for drag bingo on Tuesdays."
21,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Place looks fun 👌🏳️‍🌈
22,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly & cosy gay bar, looking out over the canal. Lovely staff, and the spirits are doubles 😀 Was a lovely place to spend New Year's Eve!"
23,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I always loved QH! Cozy  furnishing with a fine view over one of the oldest canals of the city. Famous by locals and tourists from all over the world for the bingo on Tuesday. Check the agenda for other great performances and street …
24,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great fun! Caraoke night was very well organised and atmosphere was marvelous! No shame, everybody applaused and sometimes sing along. Dreamed staff!!! I really love this place and had the best night❤❤❤"
25,The Queen's Head, 1 star ,7 months ago,"They literally got us out on the sidewalk while my friend was feeling bad, we gave a very good tip but I guess they don’t care at all"
26,The Queen's Head, 2 stars ,4 years ago,It is nice atmosphere but if you come for a bingo then mind that you will pay for every round not only one time - so to win you need to pay 5 times 10 euros not only 10 for one card. And you will fast notice it is also not 100% fair...
27,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Bingo on Tuesday’s which is quite packed and great fun.  Drag MCs are funny and offer up witty banter.  Drinks are reasonably priced.  Diverse international crowd but like most of AMS, the locals are anything but friendly."
28,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was absolutely fantastic and Daniel went out of his way to be hospitable and accommodating. Will be coming back every time I’m in my favorite city, Amsterdam. Also, music was 10/10"
29,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A very clean bar unlike others of the same clientele.
30,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is by far the best bar we've been to since we've been in Amsterdam. The staff and customers are beautiful, friendly and welcoming. Can't wait to visit again! ❤️❤️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈"

32,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They told me if I give them give stars and wrote something I'd get a free shot...
Seriously, great bar, fun staff, loads of great weekly events. A local staple of the LGBT+ community in Amsterdam"
33,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The music is amazing. The bartenders are the sweetest and very accommodating to customers. Recommend to any queer and allys in Amsterdam
34,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice pub, not only for gay ppl. Smoking area is best one you can find in Central Amsterdam and Guinness is served well!"
35,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to hang out and drink. Daniel it's an awesome bartender. He's friendly and always remembers me. A must see. Ask for him by name.
36,The Queen's Head, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The bar is ok little bit classic but the problem is the headwaiter Roberto who think he is the Queen(shead) himself,  realy it  is the most arogant person that we met in Amsterdam. I realy dont know why he is working there. We met diferent …"
37,The Queen's Head, 1 star ,3 years ago,This bar does not want your money and everyone who works there is incredibly rude.  I've never seen a more unprofessional and inconsiderate group of people running a bar. PLEASE  do yourself a favour and go elsewhere. This place is not worth your time.
38,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"friendly atmosphere - the owners were kind and welcoming. Even if you don't smoke, check out the view from the smoking room downstairs - amazing view of the canals"

43,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tuesday bingo is a blast. Awesome singing, over the top behaviour and great insults...it's all there. I would recommend it."

52,The Queen's Head, 1 star ,3 years ago,There was 5 people in the bar and the bartender was far to busy chatting up some guy to sell me a drink.  After waiting 15 minutes and being ignored I left.
53,The Queen's Head, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always a good time with a mix of cultures and ages with gently, nice barkeepers! Music is modern:))"
