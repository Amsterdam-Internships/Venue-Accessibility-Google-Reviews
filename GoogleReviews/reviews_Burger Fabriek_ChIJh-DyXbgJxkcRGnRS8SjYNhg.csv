0,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,3 months ago,"don't waste your money here. Had the saddest little veggie burger today, when I asked for sauce, it was charged extra. Family are the Wagyu burgers which were alright but overpriced. You can find this quality and better anywhere else for lower prices."
1,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,a month ago,"The burgers were not bad, but not really great either. But I loved the milk shake, that was awesome."
2,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great fries, OK burger. Up beat throwback music, not expensive. The staff was friendly. We happened to go here because it was quite late, and couldn't find another place. Over all a OK experience."
3,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Great selection of meat and burgers and pretty good actually. All the extra are charged separately, make sure you know what you order if you want something special. ‚Ä¶"
4,Burger Fabriek, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Tuna salad was ok, just canned but fine. But the burger buns were unfortunately pretty dry...and the meat wasn't seasoned at all. Fries where also fine. But the burger were not so in point for a burger restaurant with that prices. Pretty disappointing."

10,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The menu is very unusual, offering burgers from different countries based on traditional ingredients from those countries üòã Fries come free if you take such a burger!! Nice atmosphere and staff! Will come there again to try each country üòâ"
11,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was Okay. Wasn't wowed by the flavours of the burgers. I felt rushed. And this wasn't the express one. Weren't to the non express one so we could have a restaurant experience. Got given a foreign menu, it wasn't till after I left I ‚Ä¶"
12,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to eat Burgers. The staff was very friendly and our food came very quickly. The Burger was delicious and came with a quiet big portion of fries. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice in general, but the loud music disturbed a little bit."
13,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice and tasty Burgers had the Foie Gras Burger which was delicious. The location is pretty cool as well. For some reason we waited quite long until we got the menu and could order. The Staff was friendly but it looked a bit chaotic maybe there was a lack of staff that day. Anyhow good choice to try, I would come back for sure."
14,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place. Good and quick service, the beef burger was good but the chicken burger wasn't so good. Onion rings and fries tasty. If you are in the center this is a nice place where to go."
15,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good food! Great atmosphere. Service pleasant enough. Burger and a beer here cant go wrong. Recommend.
16,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place to go for Burger near the Centraal Station. The best thing is you can create your own Burger with a list of toppings from which you can choose. There are also 3 different kind of beef (their basic one, Angus Beef and Wagyu (but ‚Ä¶"

20,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Very good burger and decently priced with fries. Great music and good staffs services. Will come again!
21,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had a nice burger and hot dog here. Had to wait about 5 mins for a table as it gets busy and is a small place inside. My only disappointment was asking for cheese instead of guacamole on my hotdog and they didn't do this. A simple task one ‚Ä¶
22,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good Burger and fries served by friendly service staff. The milkshake was okay. The restaurant is styled like an American Diner.
23,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I'll make this short. Burgers were average , not so tasty. The pomme frittes were quite good. They have a big table which is very cool, since you have tap beer (Heineken). The decor is very cool too. Staff isn't that friendly, could ‚Ä¶"
24,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Burgers are amazing, really tasty, but hotdogs was just a susage and roll - definitely overpriced. Also, I didn't like that we couldn't pay separately as there were around 9 people to share a bill, was really hard to do it."
25,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there just by coincidence. The beef is a really good quality one and the plates are pretty big. Average prices and nice people attending. The only thing to say is about the potatoes, maybe I'm weird, but I like my potatoes to be oily, ‚Ä¶"
26,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Average burger, we ordered Wagyu to have best experience but it was nothing special. The service was fast but also not very friendly, we have not been asked how we want the burger to be done, it has been served definitely not medium, only ‚Ä¶"
27,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The BurgerFabriek is a great restaurant in the Red Light District, with delicious burgers and Dutch fries. They even have a table with your own beer tap! Go here and try the typical thick Dutch fries with mayonnaise. Yummy!"
28,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best burger in the Red Light District since Getto closed. Friendly staff. Not cheap, but will fill you up and satisfy you."
29,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very tasty burgers
30,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,a month ago,Worst Burgers ever and crazy prices. Veggie Burger is terrible
31,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Solid burger spot with fun international combinations of condiments to make regional flavors. Hotdogs are delicious too.
32,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Burger buns were not good, the quality reduced over time. Pretty expensive for this quality."
33,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best burger franchises in Amsterdam. It was rather full but we got served quickly.
34,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice chicken burger and wings. Veggie burger could have been better
35,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Excellent and friendly service üëå, the food was delicious and the meat inside was pink and done professionally üçî‚≠ê  , the prices are acceptable for Amsterdam I would recommend to back"
36,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The restaurant has nice interior. The food is quite good but there is point minus, where the burger were not that tasty as you would expect for the price. The service is also good. It's a place to if you have to eat but if you have the choice, cannibale royal was the better place the day before."
37,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Super burger, and very filling - probably didn't need the chips, but would like to go back and try their milkshake üòâ"
38,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice, cozy environment decorated after the proposal of the place: a burger factory. Option to customize your burger and reasonable prices make me give this place a five."
39,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We had some Hotdogs and some drinks. Nothing special, but the music was very good..."
40,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The food was nice after waiting over 40 mins for it to come to us we had to ask if our food was on but the waiter didnt really seem to care when asking her...  Like i said tho the food is nice
41,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very good burgers for a reasonable price.
42,Burger Fabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The burger are really cool and the tap beer at the table is really funny however they not server a tap of water. They force us to buy a bottle them forgot to bring it.The service was not great. Definitely could be a 4* if they force you to paid for water!!
43,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They have really awesome tasting burgers and fries, one of the best I've ever had.
The staff is super friendly and helpful. ‚Ä¶"
44,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The Burger was awesome. The Quality of the meat was perfect. Only the service was a little bit slow
45,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to eat with friends while in Amsterdam. Good service and nice atmosphere.
46,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent burgers, made myself a unique burger with Avocado and bacon.. Awesome. Atmosphere was quite good. Been there with a group of 15, sadly we were not able to get a table for the whole people. But nevertheless it was possible to chat with everyone besides the meal. 5/5 would recommend."
47,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Quality and quantity is a match made heaven so when you find it you need to praise it. Very tasty burger with a large portion of hand cut chips. Staff is professional and quick. I believe there a few in Amsterdam so if you don't manage to ‚Ä¶
48,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"High quality, beautiful environment, amazing service and friendly staff."
49,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was pretty good, the beer cold and the staff friendly."
50,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious burgers for a good price! Came here with some friends - we enjoyed it, only thing is that one of the burgers was a little too cool, probably because they tried to bring all the burgers at once."
51,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very delicious burgers, good service, price is ok."
52,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice burgers. You can choose from a selection burgers with a country as theme or build your own. Both the American and Dutch burger were delicious. Good choice for a quick but quality dinner.
53,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,3 years ago,"You will find rather nice settings for the very touristy area, and a promising menu! however the food quality is very poor, the burger buns are dry, and tasteless. The meat, well done, isn't very good as well.
The service is fast but absolutely uncaring and unsmiling."
54,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place! I very much recommend it!
Customizable menu (choice of burger toppings or through a selection of standard ones) and decent side selection. The food is great! Fairly priced - the price is similar to a normal dinner restaurant around Amsterdam (~‚Ç¨13-17 for a meal with a drink)."
55,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty burgers and hot dogs. Helpful staff. Nice restaurant design.

However, waiting till waiter come to you is absolutely 2 long. ‚Ä¶"
56,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice cosy place with a rustic vibe, nice old school music makes it a pleasuful experience. Waiters were super fast and kind. If your accustomed to high fat percentage beefs this might not be the place for you. The burger patty reminded me of a walk in the dessert (unseasoned and dry)."
57,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The burgers were OK, nothing very special in flavor. We were in a group of 5 and it was difficult to find a table at that time in Amsterdam - they had a round spot perfect for us with a beer tap in the middle. The staff was quite friendly but strangely there was a problem with splitting the bill."
58,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice food! I had a custom burger and it was delicious: very good meat, tasty bread, veeeery good fries and super nice people."
59,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice very informal burger bar. Burgers served with fries which are good, but be prepared for it to get messy. Veggie burgers are unfortunately simply a portobello instead of a Veggie patty, which is disappointing. Taste is good. Not cheap but not too expensive."
60,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was ok. The chips were a bit overdone and the choices for everything other than burgers were quite limited. E.g. there were very few side dishes to choose from. I couldn't have vegetables or mashed potatoes with my burger, only chips and salad. You couldn't have free tap water either."
61,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is nice. Great burgers with standard amsterdams beer. The thing here is to prepare you own burger! Price are okay. Good option if you are starving:)
62,Burger Fabriek, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Burgers were way to well done, service took long and they played loud and weird music.
I had the breakfast burger and it came with beans, I never had worst beans in my ‚Ä¶"
63,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great menu with lots of options of burgers inspired by cuisine from around the world! There is definitely something for everyone ‚Ä¶
64,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"VERY tasty burger. It is up there with Burgermeister in both quality and taste of their 'artisanal' burgers.
Juicy without being sopping, and with lots of flavour. ‚Ä¶"
65,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nicest burger I've ever eaten.
I ordered the Spanish burger. It came on a crusty roll.  I knew it had been freshly made and not frozen. ‚Ä¶"
66,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The staff where so nice! And for the price you pay for the food it is unreal! Amazing quality both in the main restaurant and the take away! They need to bring this to London... one of my highlights in Amsterdam! Lol
67,Burger Fabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"When you open a burger place and your burgers are worse than McD's, you're in the wrong business! Burger was dry, not enough sauce, beef overlooked to uniform grey colour but no brown crust from the grill... don't know how they managed it. Unimpressed and surprised by 4+ star rating on Google maps ‚Äì is it left by hungry stoners?"
68,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We stopped here for lunch and we both had salads. The staff were friendly and the food was tasty. And we were both impressed. My wife visited the toilet and said they were disgusting so maybe great to eat but not to relieve yourself.
69,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Real good quality and very tasty burger, nice place and friendly staff. I had Black Angus 270g. Recommend it a lot, I'll be coming back 4 sure."
70,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best burgers I have eaten in Amsterdam! The patty was juicy, thick, and garnished well. Would definitely recommend to check out!"
71,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice burger and responsive staffs
72,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great food with big portions actually we couldn't eat it all, I do recommend the salmon Burger.Staff was nice as well."
73,Burger Fabriek, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Burger was nice but prices were a bit pricey, especially for what you're getting. ‚Ä¶"
74,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Burguers have a good size and tasty. We had to burguers and two small drinks and it was 30 euros, not very cheap but good quality in food. Tables at the front are better than the ones at the back area, try to get one of the first ones."
75,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We had a good burger here. Staff was very friendly.
We were here with a group of 4 after a day of conference. We wanted to pay each 1/4th of the bill. They didn't allow is to pay in 4 parts. We could only do 1 credit card transaction. I never had this before."
76,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The burgers were fantastic, fresh and light. Paired with the fries and hotdogs, the food was a knockout! Would definitely go back next time I'm in Amsterdam!"
77,Burger Fabriek, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I bought the vegetarian burger, it was just sloppy mushrooms and courgettes, not an actual burger. Plain and boring, little flavour. I also tried some of the beef burger and it didn't taste seasoned at all, hardly any flavour. Would not recommend going."
78,Burger Fabriek, 2 stars ,4 years ago,food was average. Husband had a burger and i had a salad. Service was overall great by everyone we came in contact with but the actual person who waited on us at our table was incredibly rude and unhelpful...especially when I asked a ‚Ä¶
79,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The staff were more concerned with getting us out of the restaurant in under 20 Minutes than providing good service. Very rude when serving. Charged ‚Ç¨3.50 for 200ml of water. Even though card is accepted, they will not split the large bill so that everyone can pay with card."
80,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Helpful staff, my girlfriend has a gluten alergy that staff were happy to accommodate. The meal was fantastic, just the right ammount of food. The menu allows you to customise burgers. The chips were great too! All in all, very happy for the money! Would deffinately recommend if you can get a seat! üòâ"
81,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great burgers and service
82,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Stuff is extremely nice. Waiter - a blond guy with a rose tatoo on his right hand - was super lovely. He brought me new fries when I put waaaaaay too much salt on mine. Also the danger dog (daaanger zone!) was really tasty. Prices and ok and beer is not disgusting ;)
83,Burger Fabriek, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Tables are really squeezed in and not comfortable at all. The burger was ok and the chips was good and really think I would have enjoyed the food more in a different setting.
84,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I went there many times because I like the food but last week they were busy and they didn't even let us finish our beers after we had a lot of food because they said ""sorry guys it's too busy"" here there is the bill, we need the table ‚Ä¶"
85,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Only REAL BEST BURGER IN TOWN ! Their burgers and Hot-Dogs are soooo tasty, and really cheaper than other places.
Everybody should go there ! Made with love, thank you so much"
86,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Food was great and service was fast and friendly. It is expensive but everywhere in Amsterdam is to be fair. Have visited before and would go again. The meat is really good quality.
87,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent burgers and service!
88,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,3 years ago,"DO NOT EAT HERE!‚Äî if I could give this place 0 stars, I would! The wait staff was extremely rude and full of attitude. Not once did they check on our table to see if everything‚Äôs was okay. They brought out our food with no napkins or cutlery. Food is less than mediocre. You are better off going across the street."
89,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We ordered the vegetarian burger and Dutch burger. Literally best burgers we‚Äôve had in a long time, good service and prices are competitive. I would definitely go back!"
90,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place, is bigger than it looks. The burger was good and the fries amazing. Friendly staff and always around to help. There is a tap for beer at each table."
91,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,a year ago,"High quality meat in burgers with a not expensive price tag, a really friendly staff and some pretty good music. Would definitely come back."
92,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This is NO Old Amsterdam you can pick on your burger!!!! Please, do not mislead yourself as a tourist. The burger was furthermore very dry. There are better places you can eat a burger around the area..."
93,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Wouldn't recommend at all, staff were incredibly rude. Three different staff members completely ignored us for over 10 minutes standing at the door waiting to be seated. They kept avoiding eye contact and acted as if we weren't there, not ‚Ä¶"
94,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,a year ago,This was one of the best experience in Amsterdam so far I had the chef's special with Gamba it was very good. Overall great place kind employees good food.
95,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,If you want to experience Dutch food on a more luxeurs level this is a very nice place with good customer service. The prices are not very expensive vs a resturant but for the type of food you can usual find cheaper version at a snack bar (a lot of trainstation have them).
96,Burger Fabriek, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Decent burger spot with an industrial atmosphere complete with pipes piping Heineken to each table. The staff was bend over backwards nice and all in all a good time.
97,Burger Fabriek, 1 star ,2 years ago,If I could leave a zero I would! My father-in-law ordered some ribs only to find out that the Lebanese place next door that makes them gave his ribs to someone else in their restaurant. Ridiculous! We are baffled by the service.
98,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Vegetarians do not hesitate to join your meat-eater friends to this Burger place. The veg options are SUPERB! Oh and..The carnivores were drooling on and on about the Wagu beef burgers.

104,Burger Fabriek, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Impressive burgers. I really enjoyed the foie burger with wagyu and red pepper. It would be great to have an option of sweet potatoes on the side. Beer was great too!

128,Burger Fabriek, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The only place in the center of Amsterdam after 22:30... food is overpriced and nothing special, this is one of those businesses for stoned tourists who are willing to pay more than ‚Ç¨10 for a mediocre hamburger"
