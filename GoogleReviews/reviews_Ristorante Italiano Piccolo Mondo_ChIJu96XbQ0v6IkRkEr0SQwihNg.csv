0,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 2 stars ,a month ago,waitress was very nice but the food was not. steak was undercooked badly and made me sick. chef may have just had a bad night but the creative choices put into each plate was overwhelming to look at.
1,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Absolutely wonderful, let me start by saying that my to-go order had freshly grated parm!!  From Veronica making deliciously dangerous drinks and great conversationalist,  to Roland, the attentive and kind manager.  Thank you for the ‚Ä¶"

4,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 3 stars ,a month ago,Went there for Valentine's Day Was a little disappointed. No special menu I had the bronnize And vegetables was way too oily didn't even finish it throughout the  Left over.
5,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Have never had a bad meal here and I keep coming back for more.   Roland the owner is very hands on and takes personal pride and it shows.

6,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Nice Italian restaurant with decent food and silent environment. Definitely worth a try.
7,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Absolutely incredible food and drinks . This is my go to spot. Mussels are incredible, they are in a sweet chili broth made with San marzano tomato, pancetta, onions and fresh herbs. The baked clams , short rib meatballs for second course , and lastly the stuffed Veal Chop Valdastona. Done . Always amazing . This is a must go to ."
8,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Double cut pork chop always delivers. Artichoke app is unreal, and I don't care for artichokes."

10,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One dish was better than the next. The parpadel bolonase was the best I've ever tasted. It was a hard dish to follow however the seared scallops with risotto was ridiculous as was the chicken picolo mundo. Highly recommended.
11,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"The only thing better than the service was the food. Our waiter Alex was attentive, polite and timed the serving of every part of our dinner from appetizers to dessert.  The cocktail, The Messenger, was fantastic.  We will be coming back with friends in the near future."
12,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"We sat outside where our table was on a slant, so that was our first issue.  The service was horrible,  slow, and non existant.

17,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We went there Sunday. I've lived here for many many years and I have never enjoyed a dinner more.

18,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We went there recently. I decided to give it a couple of weeks before posting. I wanted to see if my opinion mellowed because I was angry!

24,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I went here with another couple and we recommended the steak that has been consistently great in the past. The steak came out medium, we ordered medium rare, and sent it back. The next steak came out with some white stuff on top and was ‚Ä¶"
25,Ristorante Italiano Piccolo Mondo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Would have never thought that a veal jus as a sauce for a scallops dish would make sense.
