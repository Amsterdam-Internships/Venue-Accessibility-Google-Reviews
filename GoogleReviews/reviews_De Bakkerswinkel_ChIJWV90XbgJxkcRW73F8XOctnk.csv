1,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Great pastries and breakfasts - friendly service and homemade jams and curds. Well worth a visit and average price.
2,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very nice place with a great light inside.
Friendly staff.

3,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Staff is extra friendly and the food is good! Highly recommend it.
4,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cool and charming place to get breakfast. A variety of options, from sweets to egg/bread dishes. They also serve lunch dishes, such as sandwiches and soups. They also make their own jam. I loved their passion fruit jam, it was so delicious!"
5,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Heavenly jams, especially the passion fruit jam. Scones when they are warm, they are so delecious with spreading the cream cheese on them. My son tried the Makarel rolls and they were very tasty too. I loved the place and its bakery smell. Highly recommended."
6,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best place in Amsterdam for Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch or High Tea. A well kept secret by local Amsterdam is this amazing place. We had the Broodjes lunch -koud- arrangement as breakfast, which consists of bread, various spreads (ham, …"
7,De Bakkerswinkel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Will come back again just for the nice fruit jams and curds for breakfast.
But a place like this need better coffee and tea. Coffee was ok. Not fantastic. If you order tea- just make sure they give you enough tea leaf in the bag. I cannot believe they serve such ridiculously weak tea. Over all- a slightly pricey breakfast."
8,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There is a lot of space inside, so you can easily find free table. Most of all I liked apple pie. Very delicious."
9,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best scones in town! Great taste and good variety of flavors. Moreover, the place is very clean, despite its touristic location. The customer service is good and very friendly."
10,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"verry nice place with delicous food and prices that are amazing when you compare it to all the other tourist traps that demand 5€ for a croissant. the star is friendly the place is really cosy with jacket racks, news paper and glass roof.
lots of food is home made!"
11,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great place to enjoy a simple breakfast and a variety of baked goods. The apple pie wasn’t the best I’ve had in Amsterdam - the apples were a bit crunchy. But overall, the atmosphere is cosy and the food was delicious."
12,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Yummy food, lovely location and one of the cutest menus you’ll ever see 😍"
13,De Bakkerswinkel, 1 star ,7 months ago,A man with grey hair rudely kicked me out for having spent only 15€ after 3 hours that I had walked in the bakery. There are many ways of telling things to people and he definitely did not choose the right one. I have lived in the …

17,De Bakkerswinkel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place with a lot of breakfast and lunch options...
Very helpful and friendly staff."
18,De Bakkerswinkel, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"After a few years as a regular customer it is time to stop, say goodbye and search for a different bakery, where the level of arrogance, bad manners and so called ''being direct"" performed by some staff members will be low or non existing."
19,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the most delicious Sandwiches I ever had. Only fresh and high quality ingredients. Perfect place for a long and relaxing breakfast/lunch or even lunch.
20,De Bakkerswinkel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, normal breakfast, loved the jam"

23,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very nice place with gread homemade food and friendly staff. Try the scones & curds/jams!
24,De Bakkerswinkel, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Food was good and the staff was friendly. The only downside was that the toilets were dirty. Apart from that I would recommend it!
25,De Bakkerswinkel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy and warm ambiance. Quiet spot in the middle of the town bustle. Kid friendly.
26,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had a Dutch breakfast for the first time — it was delicious, but I must say I've got a bit of a cheese overdose though. The waiter was very kind, and explained everything on the plate, including the right combinations. Oh, and the fresh juice! 👌"

28,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Cute place with delicious food and very welcoming and nice staff! Totally a must go in Amsterdam for a sweet break 💖
29,De Bakkerswinkel, 3 stars ,a year ago,"It is a very warm and cosy place, the best of it all was the wonderful smell of freshly, homemade bread and cakes. The lunch tasted good but was not very special, it did fill my stomach well! The staff is friendly and showed a heart for this place."
30,De Bakkerswinkel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious food but the staff was so rude that I wouldn't be going there again! Also beware, it's crazy crowded."

Home made cooking, tasty and not too expensive"
34,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"No nonsense, fresh-baked bread and scones, home made marmelade and cakes! Smells and tastes DE-LI-CIOUS!!"
35,De Bakkerswinkel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food and drinks were great. A bit pricey to our opinion. Service friendly and welcoming. The only down point that really annoyed us was that they DID NOT agree to split our bill. :-(   I wanted to pay with card for my part and my friend with cash on her part but They refused to do so. Too bad
36,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pumpkin's soup, traditional beer and good atmosphere. Everything is cosy!"
37,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Love the food they have here. I always tell myself to get something different when I visit, but I am a sucker for the Scones with clotted cream and the curds (especially lemon!).  Luckily my company always takes something different. We have …"
38,De Bakkerswinkel, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was solid but wouldn't say it was mind-blowing (had the yogurt with homemade granola and spouse has the French breakfast). It's just a nice cafe with good bakery items. Seemed a little expensive (€9-13 for a basket of 3-5 bread items, some butter and jam, a cup of coffee or tea, and a small glass of juice) but not outrageously so."
39,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Had a sandwich and a brownie. Both were good - but the brownie was especially like no other. It was not too sweet and had a strong hazelnut taste which I loved! The only downside was that there were no seats but I think I'll make myself a loyal customer. Everything homemade and super lekker!
40,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very tasty breakfasts, very friendly service, but the hidden gem are the jams and curds! I've bought 4 jars for home and already need more after 2 weeks! So be sure you try them and you'll love them!"
41,De Bakkerswinkel, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Good balance price/quality
and cozy interiors. We had the
Baker's Breakfast with fried eggs and was delicious. The fresh jams that came along, three, were also very tasty. It definitely deserves a visit for breakfast."
42,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The Dutch Breakfast menu is very good with delicious bread, cheese and homemade jams. The fruit shake served with the menu is also excellent. All for the price of 12,75€. The staff is also very nice."
43,De Bakkerswinkel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Good location. A lot of variety in the menu. Need more effort in the cleaning. Portions is small though its consider expensive !! Anything more even extra bread you have to pay for it!! …
44,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place provided a truly delicious breakfast in a lovely atmosphere.  The bread was amazing.  I could not be happier.  ( I rarely post or review, but my great experience here compelled me to do so. )"
45,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very very good. The passion fruit jam was divine!
46,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best freshly made homemade jam in Amsterdam. Strawberry jam, pineapple jam, pasionfruit jam, mango orange jam. Awesome indeed. Come in jar, eat as much as u can!! Coffee was excellent too. The elder waiter (maybe owner?) was excellent too, friendly and nice."
47,De Bakkerswinkel, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"We stood half an hour waiting to be seated in a queue that grew longer by the minute. Customers wouldn't stop going out, tables were empty but no one of the staff even turned to the us waiting. I had to rudely ask a waiter to attend us …"
48,De Bakkerswinkel, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Hyped up by most blogs. It's simply a bakery with seating options. I'm sure the bread and pastry selection on its own is great but my boyfriend and I went for lunch to De Bakkerswinkel and weren't impressed. Waiting lines are long and the service very Dutch. I was incredibly excited for the scones but they didn't meet my expectations.
49,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food and atmosphere, helpful staff and not too pricy for Amsterdam standards for what you get."
50,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We came here for breakfast with a group of 10 after spending the night partying. The staff did everything to make it possible for us to sit together. The choice is huge and the quality is great, it was a perfect breakfast!"
51,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This place was great! Our waitress was so nice! Beer and sandwiches were delicious! The carrot soup was excellent too! The desserts made daily by the chef's mom is a must!
52,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This was our first meal in Amsterdam - a short stroll from our hotel (Grand Amrath).  It was delicious - wonderful bread and pastries.  Cozy, cute and reasonable.  A great introduction to Dutch dining and a good spot to refuel, grab breakfast and coffee and fortify ourselves for walks around Amsterdam!"
53,De Bakkerswinkel, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The place has a lot of potential, and some of the staff are very nice, but one man with grey hair gave the worst customer service. He was incredibly rude and had the most terrible attitude. …"
54,De Bakkerswinkel, 1 star ,3 years ago,I was there with my husband for a Sunday breakfast being the last day of our weekend trip to Amsterdam . I ordered eggs on toast with a cup of tea and I saw other tables having some jam so i figured we can help ourselves to some jam that …
55,De Bakkerswinkel, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Good location. A wide variety of choices in the menu both for food and beverages. However, service made clear that profitability and turnover were more important than the client. Customer always should come first and this ruined our experience in the cafe."
56,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food is absolutely delicious! Friendly staff, nice ambience.
We had absolutely nothing to complain about :)"
57,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Favourite little teatime shop in the city! Freshest baked goods ever. The scones and cheesecake are the best. Homemade jams and curd are to die for.
58,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Get here for a breakfast! Delicious food and a rustic relaxed atmosphere.
No time to sit? Grab something from the bakery. Grab their brownies.
It seems they rather faced some kind of magic than the oven. Highly addictive."

Slow service, be patient!"

64,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Went for brunch and was delicious! I loved that they told you on the menu if the items were organic or not- I like the extra info. Staff was friendly, which was the opposite from what I was told to expect in the Netherlands."
65,De Bakkerswinkel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Warm, personable service, excellent warm fresh scones, and the best hot chocolate o have tried in NL or Germany!"
66,De Bakkerswinkel, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice breakfast spot in a central location. Lots of homemade breads, jams, and sweets. Breakfast was European with bread and jams but could add eggs. Yogurt and homemade granola was very good."
