0,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I love this place! The guys working inside are very kind. There‚Äôs a lot of different types of Iberico ham. We stopped by for a quick sandwich....you have the option of adding cheese (which I did) but I would actually recommend against it. ‚Ä¶
1,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Yes, you can opt for a pricey pre-made sandwich and walk away grumbling on review sites about this place being overpriced, or you can spend a bit more time and get the full gold star treatment and learn why that sandwich is bit more Euro ‚Ä¶"
2,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious sandwiches, and great service at the counter if you want to learn about the different types of ham in store! A little pricey but worth it."
3,Ibericus Amsterdam, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great quality meat, the staff is friendly and very very Spanish. This is a meat and specifically ham lovers paradise for both sitting down or buying your own leg or sliced. Don't forget about the cheese. Coffee was a bit lesser in style and ‚Ä¶"
4,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Like a candy shop for Jam√≥n Ib√©rico lovers!
Excellent meat, friendly staff & reasonable prices for the quality.
Will certainly visit again, very recommended!"
5,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very rich and addictive taste. I loved croissant sandwich so i bought the 2nd one.
6,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Good üêñüê∑üêΩ
7,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,3 years ago,If you're a ham lover this place is for you! It is in an expensive side but the quality of tapas they sell is high grade. The staff happily showed us the hams and gave us samples prior purchasing. I highly recommend this place if you visit Amsterdam.
8,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I would give this place 10 stars if I could! The staff here is absolutely wonderful, they're so friendly and welcoming. I had just a typical sandwich and coffee and it was amazing!! The meat is delicious, the location is so convenient, and ‚Ä¶"
9,Ibericus Amsterdam, 3 stars ,2 months ago,I like ...
10,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,9 months ago,The meat doesn't get any more organic than this. The wild pigs they use for it live free lifes in secluded woods and you feel so much better eating this meat. I love this shop
11,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice assortment of jamon, cheese and other Spanish food. You can also try here before buying"
12,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is one of the places I always visit when I‚Äôm in Amsterdam, which is quite often. The staff seem passionate about their products and well informed. I usually just get the bocadillos, but have had a few of their platters as well. I‚Äôve ‚Ä¶"
13,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little cafe and shop selling Spanish ham. Take_a_way food seemed very popular with locals. I had a coffee & croissant with ham...both were delicious and inexpensive. Highly recommended for coffee and Spanish ham on baggete, bread & croissants."
14,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It offered great meats (Jamon or Hamon in Spanish), friendly stuff, deep knowledge and amazing collection. A hidden gem in Amsterdam. I was so impressed that I tried again in Rotterdam Markthal. Cheers!!!"
15,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,Passionate specialists. Best ham around. A must try!
16,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely delicious Jam√≥n. They have a large variety of ham and Spanish cheese. The staff is very knowledgeable. They take their time explaining the different types of ham and how the process goes to get the unique flavor. I definitely recommend it.
17,Ibericus Amsterdam, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Great quality and fresh but overexpensive. How can you charge 7 plus Euro for a ciabatta with minimal amount of ham? You will see great increase in sales by reducing the price. You also can't eat there if you work in the morning, It only opens at 10am and closes at 6pm. Not even 8 hours..."
18,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Just one peek in the window to watch them slice up some delicious looking, thinly sliced meats was all we needed to try it out. It was as good as it looked. If you like meat and are not a vegetarian, this is the place for you!"
19,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Top ham in amsterdam!! A bit expensive but it is totally worth it!
20,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Super fantastic! Go and eat here!
21,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent for grabbing a quick and tasty lunch. A typical Spanish ciabatta with ""jamon y queso"" for a very good price. Quick service and friendly staff. Also very good for small-medium groups."
22,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I had eaten lunch right before finding Ibericus Amsterdam, but the smell of the shop and the sandwiches in the window spoke to me. It was the best decision of my day. I don't even remember were I had lunch before the sandwich."
23,Ibericus Amsterdam, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"It's not bad, but far from exceptional. The Chorizo Iberico was pretty fatty and without much flavour, pretty disappointing to be honest. There was an jamon Iberco ham with focaccia bread that I thought was pretty good however. I'd try somewhere else to be honest."
24,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I love this place! If you like Spanish style ham there probably isn't a better place in the Netherlands to go to. Best option is to go for a late lunch when there is much less people.
25,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,6 years ago,great place for spanish ham. several different king of ham unbelivable tasty.  the place is nice and the staff friendly.  the products are not cheap but they are worth of every cent you pay.  simply great.
26,Ibericus Amsterdam, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"What I didn't like was that the glass of my apple juice was dirty and you could see the fingerprints of the workers there on the glass.
Also they don't offer alcohol drinks anymore which is absolutely not nice.
I hope they will look at these points and work on them"
27,Ibericus Amsterdam, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful ham and meats places, perfect to grab a lunch sandwich or just enjoy ham in a cone. Friendly service!"

30,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very delicious meat and friendly staff. Perfect for a Snack.
31,Ibericus Amsterdam, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"The Ib√©rico pig is an indigenous species that is only found in the Iberian peninsula. It is very different from the European white pig. The superb quality of the meat from the Ib√©rico pig is down to the climate, their freedom to roam ‚Ä¶"

36,Ibericus Amsterdam, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"It's a nice charcuterie with a wide range of selections. It's expensive, but it's worth a visit for that special picnic or boat ride."
