93,De blauwe Hollander, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A small restaurant that serves traditional dutch dishes.

It was a bit noisy from the floor upstairs but overall the service was friendly and we had a good time there
94,De blauwe Hollander, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"If you're after a menu as close to what you can classify as Dutch, this is it.

95,De blauwe Hollander, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The staff was not friendly but not entirely rude. I had a vegetable pie which was terrible. (I could not finish it.) My spouse had the beef staampot which was okay. I wish we had eaten again at Antonio’s which is next door. The food there was great!

104,De blauwe Hollander, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a good place in which you can find typical dutch dishes, both meat and fish. It is close to Leidseplein and this means that you can easily reach the Centrum or the Museum- Kwartier. The service is quite good as the food quality. If you are a group, I recommend booking the table first!"
105,De blauwe Hollander, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"The food can't be more Dutch. But it's done in a perfect way. I still can't get my head around it... As I'm used to eat this at grandma's or my mother's. But these dishes are spot on. I just loved the haring with beetroot, but highly …"

111,De blauwe Hollander, 1 star ,3 years ago,"One star for consistency. Consistently BAD. We ordered two starters and a main and the food took one hour to arrive. The bitterballen was mediocre. The potato spring onion soup weekly 'special' was overseasoned. The main, halibut, was bland …"
112,De blauwe Hollander, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Definitely the place if you want authentic Dutch food - which is more hearty than refined.  I would warn all however to come with a very empty stomach as it is very filling. We would have appreciated smaller servings so we could enjoy a …

115,De blauwe Hollander, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food! And the service was great. It is tight quarters so I wouldn't go to have a private talk. Attractive and yummy!
116,De blauwe Hollander, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Best of most tourist meals offer downtown fast food rest in crowded Amsterdam July 2019. Dutch cuisine they said. Good and kind service.

119,De blauwe Hollander, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Mixed feelings. We had a mussels pan and a vegetarian dish with cheese croquetes. The mussels were fine, fresh and tasty. But the vegetarian dish felt like an afterthought. Bland and boring in taste. But most importantly, poorly reheated …"
120,De blauwe Hollander, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Doesn't look like much from the outside however this restaurant is a little gem! Friendly and helpful staff and amazing local cuisine. Checkout the good local beers too. If you only have time to visit one restaurant in Amsterdam, make it this one!"
121,De blauwe Hollander, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really tasty food. Ordered the carrot and curry soup, which was great in this winter weather. The beef stamppot was outstanding; the gravy goes great with the stamppot (which is something like mashed potatoes with veggies in it). Price goes for €20.60 for a set of soup, stamppot and a yoghurt dessert. Recommend highly for Dutch food!"
122,De blauwe Hollander, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty meal, great service!"
123,De blauwe Hollander, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The meat wasn't bad but the clams were too cooked and they didn't tasted good, the restaurant was too hot and the tables were soo close between each other that you didn't had your privacy; but the most annoying thing was the rude staff"

126,De blauwe Hollander, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We had been hoping to find Dutch cuisine, but didn't see much around, so we decided to go to whatever looked good.  We walked around looking for a place to eat forever and found De Blauwe Hollander, a Dutch place after all!  We both had different versions of the vegetarian hotch potch, which was delicious and very filling."
127,De blauwe Hollander, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Typical local restaurant with original dutch food. Everyone who was in Holland can confim, that the dutch cuisine is nothing special. But De blauwe Hollander can show you the dutch food from the other, better and delicious way. Even a …"
