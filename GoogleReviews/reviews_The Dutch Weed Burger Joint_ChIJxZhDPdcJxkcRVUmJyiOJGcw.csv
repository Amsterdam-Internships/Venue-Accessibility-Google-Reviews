0,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I ordered the burger and it was delicious! Really enjoyed it, even if it was a bit difficult to eat - hard not to make a mess. The dessert (a sweet typical of the Netherlands) was unfortunately too sweet for me, but the cream inside was amazing. The staff was friendly and interested. Worth a visit!"
1,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Food and chill place! I didn't know what  to expect, since I am not a vegan. But I was traveling with my sister who is gluten sensitive. The Weed Burger was on point. It was flavorful and huge. I was able to split my sandwich and …"
2,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Don't miss the Dutch Weed Burger! We tried it on another location, too, but here it is much better! A normal one costs 11 Euro, and it's big enough. For €15,- you get an extra high one. …"

6,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place was on our list of places to eat at because we needed to try the healthiest burger ever made. The food they make is loaded with one of natures superfoods - seaweed (ex. 1000 x more calcium than cows milk per tsp) We had the weed …
7,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool 100% plant-based burger bar. Funny stuff- boyfriend was confused by their choice of words such as ""eat weed live long"" & ""local shroom dealer"" and gullably thought there were real hash and shrooms in the burgers! …"

9,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It was alright. Tastes really strongly of seaweed still, not in the enjoyable ""crispy seaweed"" way more like a soggy pungent seaweed.
I actually regret going here, but if you like seaweed it's probably enjoyable. …"
10,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place and nice food, but the drinks are very expensive! Would be nice if they would have a full meal option for the burgers/hot dogs with fries. Now a hotdog + fries + drink sets you back more than a whopping €17 for one (!) person. …"
11,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent Vegan place not far away from the Vondelpark by foot (it is easily reachable with the tram 17 also from center of Amsterdam).

29,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice staff, who were very helpful about my allergies. We had the burger and 'fish and chips' and they were both really tasty. The fries could have had a bit more seasoning for my taste, but they were cooked super crispy and delicious."

37,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service tool a long time. The folks who work here are good, friendly folk doing their best. The burgers hit the spot. Unfortunately for me their burgers are all made with soya protein, something I don't feel is very healthful. This won't …"
38,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If youre going to eat at a vegan (or ANY) place, this is it!"
39,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious food and lovely staff! I went with 6 friends who weren't vegan or veggie and they all loved it! One wouldn't let me try her wrap because she said it had meat in it. 😂 You fooled her! We tried all the deserts on the menu and they were delicious too! 😆
40,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I ordered a burger with fries and a coke, and the only thing that I enjoyed was the coke. The burger was really disgusting with too much sea weed taste and easily falling apart. Fries were without any taste and really dry. I won’t come here …"

Too sad that this is not in Italy :c"
43,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredible. The best vegan food I have ever eaten. Burger, hotdog perfectly spiced, such amazing flavours. Cosy little spot away from the craziness of the centre. I am so looking forward to coming back. Go eat here."
44,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very very tasty, but soooo expensive, 10 euros for the hotdog below. Other than that, very nice and very friendly service!"
45,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"It's okayish. If you compare it with other similar vegan burger joints, this is okayish. The shakes are too sweet to our taste, but ok. They have one type of fries and the burger and dog are ok. My onions were black, but the big amounth of sauce covered the bitter taste. The staff is very friendly and helps you with a smile."
46,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The doughnuts are to die for but actually every thing is great!!! I have had everything on the menu ! The milkshakes are awesome ! The staff are super friendly and helpful! All my non vegan friends and family also loved it here!

I also found the staff very friendly, would go back :)"
49,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Yes, meatlovers, the BEST burger is this vegan seaweed miracle. Also heavenly coffee, the fries and the seawharma are great, very good atmosphere and cheap for a restaurant! I had a great time and I will sure be back."
50,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Still meat substitutes but what a burst of sharp hearty flavours! Green mustard sauce for the fries worth a special mention. This is a place to bring your meat-eating friends to convince them vegans can eat VERY well!
51,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Unimpressed with the whole experience. The main choice of burger tasted like tuna. The chips were very over cooked and nearly cold. The waiting time was bad and some people who ordered after us got their food first.

56,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Supa-dupa!! Fantastic vegan food. Absolutely stunning taste. Tried both the ultra burger and the seawharma with a sprinkle of home made nice and crispy fries. A point more for the burger (maybe thanks to the kimchi) but the fight was hard. …
57,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious healthy burgers! I told my friend, ""Man this burger tastes as good as a beef burger"". He said ""No man, it's much better"". Possibly the best burger you'll ever find."

Better don't miss this great spot while visiting Amsterdam."
59,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely seaweed burgers, with good salads, and some other amazingly modern vega products, served by dedicated staff. Still, maybe better to order, the place is not the nicest to hang out long."

61,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, went in and tried the Burger, probably the best I've ever had, liked it so much went back a day later and had the Seawharma which was one of the best things i've ever ate.

82,The Dutch Weed Burger Joint, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I didn’t have the chance to taste their burgers. We went there in the late afternoon and tried to order burgers. They call themselves “Dutch Weed BURGER” but they said that they didn’t serve burgers at that moment. 😂
