0,Caf√© Fest, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Good, excellent service
Hospitality is great
Foos is nice if you add more chicken will be great. If we compare between streetfood kapslon and here. Here is great but need more meat."
1,Caf√© Fest, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Located between school buildings so it’s full of students working on their laptops or chatting with friends. Outdoor seating is also available. It serves coffee and fast food like burgers which are quite juicy and tasty. Surprised that English menu is not available though.

7,Caf√© Fest, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We come here every week with our study association. Music can be a bit loud at times but the atmosphere is nice and the people are great.
