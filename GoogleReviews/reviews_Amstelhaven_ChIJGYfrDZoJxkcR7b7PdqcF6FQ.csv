4,Amstelhaven, 2 stars ,8 months ago,Sweet potato fries were burnt and still charged to us. They also charged an espresso we didn‚Äôt have and I only noticed it at home. Overall I would have expected more from this location. My feeling is that post corona the service really deteriorated
5,Amstelhaven, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Really nice and pleasant place. We had a table right by the lake and the waitresses were super nice. My girlfriend had the regular cheese burger and she loved. I had the vegan one and it was OK (mine could have been better). But, really, it ‚Ä¶"
