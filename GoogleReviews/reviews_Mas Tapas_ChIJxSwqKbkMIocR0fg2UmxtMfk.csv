Staff was wonderful, the restaurant nice and comfortable atmosphere. 5/5 reccomend and would go back to try more tapas"
1,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Ensalada de Espana was amazingly good with cold bacon.  Paella was salty, it is good for 2.  Carne asada bao buns-the arrachera steak was lukewarm, burnt is the other side, undercook on the other and then the inside was rare… …"
2,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"We were quickly seated and the chef gave us complimentary snacks before we began eating. The portions were really big and definitely worth the money despite the restaurant already being inexpensive! Our waiter, Rudy, was super welcoming and …"

5,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,2 months ago,At hotel 3 nights. Have always liked this restaurant. Had B Sprouts plate that was very small. Have had it before so I know what it is supposed to be. Seemed like they were running thin on the Romesco and Sprouts. That was until the table …

7,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"A+++ My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Andaluz by Hilton on our trip to Texas. After checking in, we decided to investigate our dining options. Not wanting to drive anywhere, we decided to enjoy the hotel's amenities and dined at the MAS …"
8,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Staying at the hotel. Ordered take-out and they were supposed to call when the order was ready. They didn't, so by the time I went down to check what was going on, I was given a bag of cold food that nobody seemed to care about. Got 5 …"
9,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"About the most creative and civilized restaurant within about five square miles. Tucked into the very nice Hotel Andaluz, you can get anything from about the best hamburger I've ever had all the way to tapas. I think the only area of need …"
10,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"This place has a nice trendy semi fancy feel nested inside a cool old hotel now in the Hilton Curio collection...
The Tapas were all excellent and more than flavorful and we'll presented! The …"
11,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,This place is amazing! The best food I have had in so long. We tried 7 dishes and each had their own unique flavor that was amazing. I tend to shy away from hotel food but not the case here. Please come here and enjoy!
12,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 months ago,A little bit disappointed they only have the holiday menu for Christmas dinner and no tapas options.
13,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Great tapas and sangria. Our server Rudy was superb! Chef came out and checked on all tables. We tried the specials too which was based off of finds from the local farmers market.  Place was perfect for a special occasion but not too stuffy. Highly recommend.
14,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"My husband and I made two visits to MÁS Tapas Y Vino during the past week. We went with our family for our first visit a week ago, and by ourselves today. …"
15,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"The tapas were delicious, especially the potatoes. The drinks were to die for, I strongly suggest the L3s (local lavender lemon drops). I came here while visiting from the DC area and these tapas reminded me of good ole' DC cooking. …"
16,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Good food at a reasonable downtown price. The patatas tapas and the vegetable paella are so good. Just be warned - the portions are huge, even for tapas."
17,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"We tried this restaurant after reading reviews on TripAdvisor.  It did not disappoint.  We would definitely recommend and definitely return.  The service and the food were top notch.  We tried the brussel sprouts, Spanish bruschetta, green …"

21,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Not a Tapas guy because I always leave hungry. However MAS is legit great food at fare prices. From the Reposado “old Fashion” to the grilled brussel sprouts to the amazing full entrees, MAS does not disappoint. Definitely will visit again."
22,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Mas tapas y vino is a very nice restaurant to go have breakfast lunch or dinner or even brunch at. I was there for lunch. Their sandwiches are very good. The restroom was very clean also. The waiter Michael was very professional and polite. …
23,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Modern restaurant located inside the Andaluz hotel. I've enjoyed every dish I have gotten from MAS. Great food and good drinks in a fantastic location. On the weekends you can get a table in their differently themed cabanas for a more private experience. Busy on the weekends so call and get a reservation.
24,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Chef Marc Quiñones took great care of my husband and me celebrating our anniversary. The food was incredible and you can tell he loves feeding people. It was a beautiful evening.
25,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Disappointed.   The papas bravas tasted like the same frozen potatoes used for breakfast potatoes.  The Octopus was so tough it was inedible could not cut with a steak knife.  At least they took this off the bill.  Ordered the ribs and I …
26,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"We decided on the crispy Brussels, tempura fried stuffed squash flowers, Iberian black pig secrets (my favorite), and steak with potatoes.  All were creative, delicious, and we could have not been happier.  The perfect place for an enjoyable food experience!"
27,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was good, especially the potatoes. Really liked the bao buns. I was expecting more of a wine list since the name of the place was tapas and wine, but we were rather disappointed in the selection. Can’t wait to revisit and try the burger."
28,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this was not the great meal we were expecting. In previous years it’s been quite good. I suspect the hotel accountants have won and the chef is quite depressed. Ingredient quality (which is the only …"
29,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We really enjoyed the beautiful enclosed patio upstairs. We ordered the Mac us back, the mezze, and the spanish bruschetta with mushroom sauce. Everything was delicious and very filling, 3 tapas was plenty for the 4 of us!"
30,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Rudy is the best bartender in town! There isn't anything on the food or drink menu here that is mediocre. MAS tapas y vino and Hotel Andaluz are pure class on every level from the staff, the atmosphere, to the services/products provided.  I look forward to frequenting their establishment."
31,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Omg omg the food was to die for! We had such a good time here,went out for my birthday and I couldn't have asked for a better night out! We ordered 5 different dishes and the 4 of us all shared. Compliments to the chef seriously!!!!! Thank you for making my birthday such a great night!!"
32,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,3 months ago,The Paella was the most expensive and the most disappointing. It tasted like risotto in tomato sauce with 4 shrimp. And it was a small portion. We have had Paella all over the country and in Spain. None of them looked or tasted like this.
33,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,2 months ago,Went in this morning to get two burritos. I was charged $12 per burrito plus a $5 gratuity. I don't know why the gratuity if I was not dining in nor was I staying at the hotel. Total was $31.59. The burritos were NOT worth the price! There …

35,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Great service, very professional waiters.
However, the food is very expensive.
The food combinations are very luxurious and unique, but it wasn't our absolute …"
36,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,a month ago,"We went on a Monday, so it was quiet.  The food was excellent, all we took home were the bones for the dog.  The coffee was good, the tequila was excellent.  The only word of caution I would share is, though the Spanish cheese tray is …"
37,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Peppers were not blistered, but were limp and missing course salt flakes. Bruschetta is equivalent to mushroom gravy with crostini.  Asparagus veggie medley with corn as a filler.  Octopus with bolognese was the worst.  The menu reads as a …"
38,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Was not impressed. Certain tapas where quite skimpy and we had to ask for refires which took too long. The last item my party got was lamb shanks medium rare. When they came out, they where cooked well and where dry. At this point we just …"
39,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,It’s a strange time to go out to eat but they did a nice job of setting up the upstairs open air patio for it in a safe way.  My wife and I started with two tapas-the Patatas Brava which was excellent and the Iberian Pork which tasted great …
40,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"I was disappointed. The background  music was too loud, we had to raise our voices to talk to each other.  And, we waited for an hour or more for our food. The waitress did bring us a  complementary appetizer. The kebabs were good, but not exceptional. My friend ordered the Cuban sandwich,  it looked good, but he didn't comment."
41,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"the veggie paella was a huge disappointment. overcooked rice, super saucy, the broccoli that was tempura-fried had several portions of it that were undercooked (warm mushy batter anyone?). when the server brought us another piece it was …"
42,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"COVID-19 Anniversary dinner.  Always solid food and drinks.  Limited menu, but everything really good.  Must try the Secreto tapa and Manchego mac n cheese."
43,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had the tapas. 4 different items that were each awesome on there own plus 2 desserts to share. The Tribeca cocktail was wonderful. We will be back.
44,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,4 months ago,I would not recommend this restaurant for Tapa's.  I was very disappointed with the food.  One dish (Octopus) we sent back because it was so over cooked and tough we could not even cut it with a steak knife.  The best thing about dinner was our bottle of wine!!
45,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, great atmosphere. Made a second visit and am making this a 5 star. Amazing service top to bottom. To quote my favorite body builder of all time ""I'll be back"""

47,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Mars is amazing food delightful I thought they're deconstructed the pork and beans was ingenious flavors exceptional they have all their covid thing going on which is still an irritation but totally worth it prices are reasonable if you're ever in downtown Albuquerque Copper and 2nd you need to go the food is great
48,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Hurts me to post this - really it does. We have been going here for years and the food is excellent- always. It was this time too but tonight we came for our 10 year anniversary and we ordered 6 tapas between two of us to share. They …
49,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,4 months ago,Disrespectful front desk lady. She wasn't ready to seat us in the night even when there were plenty of tables available. The lady at the bar also was rude. We decided not to be humiliated any further and walked out.
50,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food and atmosphere. Waitress did not care about us or our experience :( will try again hopefully with a better server.
51,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Food was very good.  Fortunate enough to meet and speak to Chef Marc.  He spent time talking to us and telling us about his Hell's Kitchen e perience. …
52,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I've been here 4-5 times. The atmosphere is amazing. The service isn't very good. They act like they are doing you a favor for serving you. Asked for silverware, salt and pepper after our steaks arrived and the waitress told me to go to the …"
53,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best place ever. Staff was over accommodating and the dining experience was excellent. Planning on having every birthday celebration there from here on in. Great job team!
54,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,My son was married at Hotel Andaluz this weekend. Chef Marc started out that day by watching the mothers struggling to carry in the wedding dress. He graciously offered his help. Fast forward to the evening - the food he prepared that night …
55,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,We stayed at the Andaluz three nights and had cocktails and dinner two out of those three.  Both the cocktails and the tapas & entrees are original and delicious.  Portion sizes are generous; one evening the two of us easily made a meal out …

60,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Elegant restaurant with some Spanish tapas re-elaborated in American style located inside a level hotel. Good wines choice. Affordable prices.
61,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"We stayed in Andaluz on a long road trip that included Albuquerque.   I really had hoped the hotel's in-house tapas place would be great but was pretty disappointed.   I can see the chef's concepts and can appreciate the intent, but …"
62,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,7 months ago,we came to visit Albuquerque for a month and this was the first stop. Located inside the beautiful Hotel Andaluz. …
63,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The arugula salad was good. I had the lobster wellington with tarragon risotto and the welly was over done and the risotto was under. The steak my date had was over as well. All in all it was a decent meal but a little lackluster considering the occasion. However, the ambiance and drinks were fantastic."
64,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Ordered a beef Wellington! It was super good! Chef Marc was the best at making the beef wellington and came to our table and chatted with us for a bit. My son loves the fries. The reason I gave a 4 star was because the cake was dry and stale!
65,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"The saving grace about this restaurant is the service. Shirah is amazing! She is the only reason we didn’t leave after the second app.
What’s not pictured is the fried squash blossom app, with was, in two words: …"

68,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Provides a warm, earthy atmosphere with unique dishes and engaged service. Rudy, thanks for the experience."
69,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Nice historic building decorated with a bit of a Moroccan flair. Reserve a private table off the lobby.
70,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"The food was so good!!! The squash  stuffed with Goat was tasty, the salmon was cooked to perfection, the half chicken had a wonderful flavor and service was timely and accommodating. (Out of towners)"
71,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good selection of wines. Interesting selection of tapas. I choose a delicious selection of cheeses. Serving size could be shared amongst friends. Staff was attentive and friendly.
72,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,My brother travels extensively & eats out frequently. He was impressed with the fare and the service. We like to bring out of town guests to this venue as it hasn't failed to impress! Our food arrived promptly and was served hot. Everything tasted delectable. The wind picked up and it started raining (monsoon season)
73,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Over the top amazing service and scrumptious food! Highly recommend for a date night!
74,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"The food was decent but I didn't feel wowed.

I had the following: …"
75,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent meal for our first time dining in their establishment. Got the ribeye special with red chile demi glace. Let me tell you, this was hands down, the best demi I've ever tasted. And the onion rings that came on the side were battered in a very light and airy, well seasoned batter. Chef Marc really knows what he's doing!!!"
76,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The pork belly tapas, asparagus calabacitas tapas, salmon entree & steak entrees are fire. The red sangria is amazing also."

80,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Classy environment inside the coolest hotel in ABQ. Shrimp/chorizo dish was unique and flavorful. Chicken sandwich was hearty and satisfying. Great place.
81,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere of the gem of a restaurant. Lovely, open decor and pleasant (not too loud) music are great complements to the food. Did I mention how good the food is?"
82,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Perfect birthday meal.  Celebrity sighting too!  I didn't bother them though.  Great place.
83,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,a year ago,Tapas were really good - bacon wrapped dates and the coconut shrimp on couscous.  Roast chicken is extremely salty appears to be brine soaked or injected and then drowned in barbecue sauce which is regrettable as the chicken was perfectly …
84,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Loved the bacon wrapped dates and gambas al ajillo(shrimp) tapas.
85,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Chef is awesome, very personable. Steak was really good."
86,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The whole place is like a dream.
With my stay, i got a meal voucher for being diamond member, so breakfast was the amazing house sausage,  salsa and eggs. I don't know about Albuquerque but i do know about this place! Loved every moment."
87,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,a year ago,Brussels were dried like straw.  Breading fell off chicken sandwich. Three of us ate. Only liked risotto.  Five people ate next to us and shared they didn’t care for their food. Chocolate cake awful.  Was nothing like reviews!  We ate there three nights ago. Also stayed in hotel.
88,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,10 months ago,Looked for best happy hours in Albuquerque. Called and made reservation for happy hour. Upon arrival was told there is no happy hour.  I told them about reviews and web site .  No way.  Said would talk to management about it later. Very misleading!
89,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We were there around 6pm and we were the only ones there. I checked online and noticed the menu included Bone Marrow and other interesting dishes. The ambiance is lovely. When we got seated we were handed a different menu and was told because of Covid, the menu was limited. nice"
90,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My partner and I have come here multiple times, and the food has always been delicious. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing, and the service is superb. It's a great place to get a feeling of Spain without the transatlantic flight. This is a …"
91,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Incredible tapas and a great experience. Wait staff was attentive and friendly, making helpful recommendations. This is a good spot to come if you have dietary restrictions as well. Tapas were larger than average. Very high quality ingredients. Love in the food you can taste. Thanks for a stellar experience!"
92,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,a year ago,"Waited an hour and a half for four meals, crunchy risotto and mediocre food. Food didn’t all come out together, specialty drinks were made incorrectly, we were very disappointed because the location is beautiful, but it’s not worth the …"
93,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I wish I knew our server’s name because he was fantastic. The cost can get pretty high so order smart. The elk tenderloin is to die for and the bacon wrapped dates were delicious. With our table of six, we tried a lot of the tapas. Wine recommendations were decent but expensive whiskey pours were a bit anemic. Still good though."
94,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Great ambiance and food, will absolutely go again. Chef was asked to make me grilled jalapenos and he did...(not on the menu)... The fact that this was done for me was extra special."
95,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,5 months ago,The portions were large. The flavour was  above average.  The service exeptional.
96,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We were there around 6pm and we were the only ones there. I checked online and noticed the menu included Bone Marrow and other interesting dishes.

99,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The restraunt is stunning and the vibes are great. The staff is very professional and we'll put together. I'm glad their employee Shelby waved us down while we were walking by to come in and eat. She took care of us and gave us such great …
100,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love this place. Every time we go the food is excellent. The staff is friendly and helpful. We went for our anniversary and they set a special table for us. They brought out a custom dessert with happy anniversary written on the plate in …
101,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This was not $90/person food. Uninspired and overpriced. The pork taco appetizers were meh (you can easily make better at home without much work), the chicken had ketchup bbq sauce, and the steak was overcooked and lacking flavor other than …"
102,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Hands down the best Mac n Cheese I’ve ever had, and everything else I’ve had from here is incredible!

103,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The food was excellent. Service was lacking. There were only 5 table occupied and I had to wave to receive the wine list. Then the $14 red wine was served in a white wine glass while all the tables had larger glasses on it. The Mimosa was …
104,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love to enjoy a glass of wine and small meal here.  The atmosphere is quiet, the service is impeccable and attentive. I especially like the fact that it is easy to sit with a companion and be able to have a conversation without shouting …"

107,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Pricey but you get good food! Amazing flavor mixing and quality food. Will definitely be going back for ""treat yourself"" meals."
108,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very good tapas restaurant.  The selection is not very large, but what it does,it does well. We didn't have any entrees but the standard in the kitchen seems to be across the board. Highly recommended for tapas."
109,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,10 months ago,Chicken sandwich should not have been sent out. Half of it was overcooked and just crumbled. Everything else we had was great but disappointed they let something that bad come out of the kitchen.
110,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The ambiance, the cuisine, the staff and the location...perfect. This is a great place for date night, birthday dinner or just another Thursday night. This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. So many flavors and I've never had a dish I didn't like."

112,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect end to a long day. This unique eatery is part of the Andaluz Hotel next to the convention center. I started with the bruschetta, followed up with the grilled artichokes and finally the scallops. Each plate was fantastic in flavor …"
113,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,4 months ago,Really rude staff. They seemed to give excuses not to seat and serve us while there were many tables available and it was already late at night. Will never go to this place again
114,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,a month ago,"As an indigenous business owner, it was totally disappointing to be ignored. Never again! I'll take my money elsewhere"
115,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The atmosphere is great, service was okay. Food, gets a huge thumb down. Over priced and zero flavor. The cheese plate was the best thing there.
Probably wont return to eat... I'm not sure how this has such great reviews."
116,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent excellent excellent! We had been really slow service from our server but the food and Ambience were fantastic as always. We came here for a Valentine's Day special they were doing and had a five-course meal that was utterly fantastic. Shouldn't take two and a half hours at any point though.

119,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I really liked the vibe of this restaurant.  8 of us stayed in one of the semi-private booths in the lobby. It was right next to the band so it wasn't  great for conversation. But the band was pretty good. I had a salad and the paella, and …"

121,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Absolutely TERRIBLE service.  Slow and rude waitress and mediocre food.  The ""fried"" brussel sprouts were soggy and the chicken was blanf.  Cocktails were pure liquor with no flavor.  We waited 20 minutes after sitting down in the bar for …"
122,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We very much enjoyed our brunch here.  Our server was attentive,  the food was delicious,  and the ambiance was quite pleasant.   It was a bit weird they were painting the ceiling during business hours, but overall the experience was a good one."

124,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've eaten here for lunch on two separate occasions. Most recently we ate at a table inside. Previously we ate in a casbah. I really like the atmosphere here. The casbah nooks are especially nice for a more intimate gathering with a group …
125,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful place to step away from the world for a few minutes and enjoy some small plates and wine.  Attentive service and varied choices for tapas or some larger plates. Sufficient wine list.  I highly recommend coming in through the hotel lobby and taking a few minutes to admire the wonder architecture and decor.
126,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A great restaurant on an exterior corner of Hotel Andaluz. Outdoor and indoor seating, as well as service inside the hotel lobby.

128,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food and great cocktails. Good date night atmosphere. My partner and I love coming here, but to avoid going all out we usually go to the bar which has many of the same things in a little less formal atmosphere. We have always had great service here though. Definitely would recommend."
129,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I've been here 4-5 times. The service isn't very good. They act like they are doing you a favor for serving you. Asked for silverware, salt and pepper after our steaks arrived and the waitress told me to go to the bar, because my tab was …"
130,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Disappointed. The place is nice, but the food is off. 3 of the 4 dishes we tried were too salty and garlicy, almost bitter. I got thirsty for hours after our meal. They are still tasty, but lack the delicacy you would expect from a place that sells themselves as fine dining."
131,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Restaurant that is part of the Hotel Andaluz. I stayed at the hotel for a conference. The first night I was there, my coworkers & I had dinner at this restaurant. We did not have the greatest experience as the service was slow, the food …"
132,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I highly recommend checking out this restaurant when you are in downtown ABQ. They have an award winning chef and wine list, and their staff is always friendly. The atmosphere is refined and welcoming, and the menu has many healthy options. When you go, definitely order the patatas bravas (maybe not so healthy, but WORTH IT!!)!"
133,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is aMASing! Seriously. The tapas are phenomenal and if you have never been to a Tapas bar before, I recommend getting several tapas for the table OR full sized entrees. I definitely  advise against doing both ! …"
134,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely awesome! Can't wait to go back, Chef MQ is a complete gentleman, the server Rudy knew what we needed before we could ask! We couldn't have asked for a better night! #supportlocalchefs"

136,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,9 years ago,Just had our office holiday luncheon there. It is a beautiful restaurant and hotel but the service was bad. The waitstaff was not friendly at all and not efficient. We had to  flag them down to order drinks and get a refill. The menu …
137,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First of all, this place is nominally vegetarian. Even my server was upfront about it being a ""protein heavy"" menu. And I definitely wouldn't expect to find any vegan options, save for maybe one salad. …"
138,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went last year after looking at Hotel Andaluz for a potential rehearsal dinner site. They gave us the “golden ticket” to Más Tapas y Vino, and oh my goodness, what a night. Dinner was amazing. Highly recommend."
139,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"I have eaten at Lucia three times now, first two were terrific experiences. However, last visit was absolutely awful. Our waiter seriously seemed stoned or drunk because he could not focus, would get lost in the middle of a sentence, walked …"
140,Mas Tapas, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Not a fan of their ""tapas"" menu. Overpriced for literally two (2) bites, weird combinations... purple grapes and green olives in oil??? BLEGH!!! Service is hit-or-miss. Downstairs has great service inside their tiny bar, not so much in the …"
141,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food is great but the chef was yelling at his employees the whole time. Our party of 10 all noticed and it was very annoying and no employee should be treated like that. Almost like he was trying to be Gordon Ramsay and seemed like everyone was all up tight around him.
142,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Chef Marc Q is the best! I am a fan of his and follow him where he goes. Everything on the menu is amazing and unlike anything you have had before. Sign up to receive emails and try one of his wine dinners (you are welcome 😉).
143,Mas Tapas, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Mezze was good. View was great.
144,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Incredible food, worth more than what they charge. Had the brisket sandwich for lunch. Not truly authentic Andalucía style tapas, but amazing nonetheless and they did well adapting the theme to the space."
145,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had breakfast here during our stay at the Andaluz hotel. It was delicious, I recommend the continental breakfast with eggs. Delicious, especially the yogurt with fruit. Will definitely be going back."
146,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We started with cocktails in the one of a kind lobby of a art deco meets old southwest.  After enjoying the 1939 hotel we went in for a magnificent meal. Kudos to Michael our waiter, Marc Quinones, chef, and Carlos the Manager for an unforgettable experience! Go for local drinks, port with desert."
147,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Despite the price, food was mediocre.  Was expecting something mind blowing for an $80+ tab for 2.  Instead we got average food with canned and store-bought ingredients.  Ordered chicken pincho, NM flatiron steak, smoked salmon nachos and …"
148,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Exquisite food and flavors. Beautiful space and warm staff. Our waiter Richard was engaging and helpful.
We would follow Executive Chef Marc Quinones anywhere. And have! We are fortunate to have him in Mew Mexico."
149,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,My spouse and I ordered the classic paella. The entire dish was bathed in a heavy dark sauce that tasted like motor oil with a strong flavor of burnt chorizo. It was as if a mechanic at the Indy 500 tried making paella but accidentally used …
150,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Mas truly lives up to its name! The Ricotta pancakes were big enough and thick enough for 2 to share. Turkey sausage with green chili was on point with a bite at the end.  Did I mention the quinoa sweet potato hash? Breakfast worth the eating!
151,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,MAS is totally a gem. If you're looking for your new go-to place this is IT. Chef Marc has a passion for food and his menu reflects it.  The wine selection is good and the staff is super attentive and knowledgeable. You must try this place if you haven't already!
152,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,a year ago,This is located in a building that's part of the Hilton hotel chain there botique group.

157,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,2 years ago,The food was so-so and the service was fine however would not recommend for a large group. Not only did they require one tab but were very rude about it - management was extremely disrespectful to us as guests. Very hostile environment.
158,Mas Tapas, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The absolute worst service. My husband and I sat there for 10+ minutes while the waitresses attended to multiple tables repeatedly. We were out visiting family in the area, and stopped in for some tapas, but we were at The Cellar the night …"

175,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Like many Tapas places the food is a little more expensive, but it was oh so good.  Great meal and atmosphere was good, except for the loud music coming from upstairs.  It was a Friday night so that might explain it."
176,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"The drinks were very good.   Not quite as good as the Apothecary, but the service was much better and the atmosphere was more lively.  Was rather quiet for a Friday night, but this seems to be the norm so far in ABQ (I just moved here).  I will probably go here again."
177,Mas Tapas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Wonderful small plates for sharing. Quaint place to sit and chat
178,Mas Tapas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A relaxing place to sip cocktails and eat the tapas in a terrace setting. This venue would have been even greater if it had been situated on the roof to take advantage of the impressive vista.

Do not do it, i mean it."
