Syrniki - was the best sirniki in my life!

1,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"It's such a great place - an absolute gem. The menu isn't huge, but each food is very delicious and made to perfection. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Always a pleasure to visit."
2,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,a week ago,Great place. Cozy design and nice atmosphere. Great food too.
3,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Food is fabulous here. Each plate is a skilful creation, both beautiful and delicious. Congratulations to the chefs!

5,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good food!
6,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Unique experience, each dish has a special touch to it. Everything we ate was delicious, especially the spinach soup made with coconut milk, since creme soups are usually made with creme fresch in Moldova. Great choice of wines. The atmosphere is also very nice."
7,Meatingpoint, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good food and good service but small space tho. Overall nice place to have brunch etc.
8,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are looking for good food - this is the place. It is not centrally located, but 15 min trip from city centre - worth it. Apple pie with ice cream is a great desert (and I'm not at all a fun of apple or pumpkin deserts). I enjoyed it so much that didn't even realise to take a picture first :)"
9,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to visit, even location is a bit unexpected, next to the petrol station and car wash, however you won't feel them being in restaurant. Food is tasty, quality/price is ok, parking, green gras... Nice for spending an evening, thanks!"
10,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The best place to eat in town. Locals recommended other places like Smokehouse and London's but Meating Point beats them all by far - sure it's a bit out of the way if you're in the center but the food is amazing so well worth the $2 taxi ride here.
11,Meatingpoint, 1 star ,3 years ago,The avocado bruschetta looked a few days old. I asked for sparkling water with ice and the server forgot about it and only after 15 minutes when I asked again about my water did she came back with flat water and no ice. She never came back ‚Ä¶
12,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It is a good, cosy and very pleasant surprise. Food was very good and well presented on plate. We liked the minimalistic atmosphere and we left only with good impressions."
13,Meatingpoint, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It is a much beloved restaurant in my family. The food is just exceptional ( although a bit expensive ). The desserts are the most liked part of it
