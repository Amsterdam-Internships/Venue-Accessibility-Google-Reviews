498,New Dutch, 5 stars ,2 days ago,Fabelhaftes Fr√ºhst√ºck und unglaublich freundlicher Service! Wir waren am letzten Urlaubstag dort fr√ºhst√ºcken und mussten keine 10 Minuten nach Ankunft auf unser Essen warten. Alles wird direkt frisch zubereitet und das schmeckt man auch. Preis-Leistung ist absolut top! W√ºrde immer wieder dort essen. Am liebsten 10 Sterne‚≠êÔ∏è!!
