0,'t Kuyltje, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A small and cozy bakery in the famous nine streets area.

Bread is ok, the smoked ribeye is a bit too salty. …"
1,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"During my short stay here this time I was only able to sample two broodje places, but I think this one is my favorite. Busy, locals coming in and out constantly. GREAT broodje, I loved the savory mix of mustard and mayo that really kicked my pastrami and cheese up a notch."
2,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice small family run deli. Big assortment of sandwiches like the pastrami, old cheese, mustard and pickles.. also you can try Dutch specialties like filet americain."
3,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In existence for over half a century,  t Kuyltje stands testimony to the speciality sandwiches so loved by the Dutch. With only 4 and a half by 5 metres of floor space,  this must be one of Amsterdam's smallest sandwich shops, but it ranks …"
4,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We popped by here for a quick sandwich and were so surprised by the quality of the meats and the friendliest shop keeper. I highly recommend this place for a quick bite, especially the pastrami :)"
5,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very Good handmade sandwiches with dutch products. The lady is really Nice!
6,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a great choice for a quick lunch in Amsterdam. They have a large variety of sandwich options. We got a ham option and it was very good. The place is really small with not a lot of seating in the restaurant. We took our sandwiches to go and ate them in a park. I would recommend this place for a quick meal.
7,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One the best shops in Amsterdam!it's not fast food!!!lovely sandwiches with amazing flavour and very tasty!
8,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great sandwich shop. Easy to miss or decide not to bother waiting in line to get into this small litte shop, but worth the wait. The small sandwiches make for a perfect quick bite while canvasing through the shopping district. Can be a bit confusing figuring out who’s in line to put their order in vs. who’s waiting on their sandwich."
9,'t Kuyltje, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Yummy sandwiches - tried the classic warm pastrami with cheese and kids had bacon and brie. The bread was a bit too crunchy and a little skimpy on meat but tasty. Seems to be a local favourite!
10,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great family owned and operated sandwich shop. The owner is a butcher and you can tell by the quality of the cuts. Their pastrami is excellent. In wintertime try their pea soup. Best in the 9 streets area!
11,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"There is no better shop if you want to eat a hot or cold snack quickly. These sandwiches are very tasty.  I don't know anything like that. Forget the big chains, it would only need this shop, nothing more."
12,'t Kuyltje, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Amazing little sandwich shop in Amsterdam.  Because I could not read the menu (it was in Dutch) the guy behind the counter recommended the  pastrami and cheese sandwich.  It was freakin delicious.  I only wish it was bigger.  I could eat it everyday.
13,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quick service, reasonable prices, great food. What more could you want? I highly recommend the smoked chicken and pastrami. Note: the mustard has a strong kick!"
14,'t Kuyltje, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Not a great veggie selection. Coffee was good, but the sandwich was dry despite asking for butter. Fridge was also loud. The owner is nice and interior alright."

17,'t Kuyltje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A nice place to get the Dutch Fresh Fish sandwich. It is a bread with fresh fish fillet and pickled onion to minimise the raw flavor of the fish.
