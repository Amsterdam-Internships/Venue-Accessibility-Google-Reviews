0,De Gouden Florijn, 1 star ,4 months ago,Wish there was a way to give 0 stars. The bartender was a big time racist. Lots of tourists come to Amsterdam so it's obvious that their vaccination QR code will not be accepted by the administration here but places still accept you after ‚Ä¶
1,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Turkish carpets on the bar tables, great little bar, oodles of character with stained glass windows, memorabilia all over the walls and a nice touch with Turkish style carpets as the table covers, barman was v friendly, football happened to be on which appears normal, clientele was 50:50 local:visitors"
2,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stumbled in here to escape the cold and what a surprise it was! Fantastic service and great selection of local snacks and food. Also offer a good selection of local beers. Love the decor and the vibe. Will definitely come again.
3,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My wife and I were just in Amsterdam (Jan. 2, 2017) looking for a small, quintessential Dutch pub frequented by locats when we stumbled upon the Cafe De Gouden Florijn. It's charming, intimate and wholly Dutch. Try an authentic Dutch beer ‚Ä¶"
4,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Super authentic bar, great atmosphere, great interior - especially the carpet on the table."
5,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place, it's an old bar, like a Dutch ""cantina"", near to the center, with handcrafted tap Dutch beers at 3.5 or 4 euros and traditional Dutch snacks. Have terrace too, and the bartender it's polite."
6,De Gouden Florijn, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Today I went to this bar for the first time. The bar itself is quite nice, however, the bartender was really unfriendly! He was so rude that for the first time on my life I took the time to write a review about a place. I am never coming back to this place and I will tell everyone I know to never go to this place."
7,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great bar. It's a local hang out. We always stop here when. We got to Langpura Indonesian down the street for dinner....
8,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Old style classic Amsterdam bar. Unfortunately there are not that many left but this one still going strong.
9,De Gouden Florijn, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Went in for lunch , no customers at all. Asked to eat and was told that depending what I order its possible. I ordered an item and was told no, and immediately suggested to go to a competitor business rather than see what is possible. Terrible service."
10,De Gouden Florijn, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great bar that's close to the canals and great staff.  Niko the bartender is a hell of a barkeep and pours great beers. Thanks for the good times Niko!
11,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute little bar, amazing cider, And good prices!"

17,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Pub filled with mostly locals. My wife and I just happened to go to this pub and were pleasantly surprised. They had a good selection of fine Belgian beers, and they were the cheapest around. Nice atmosphere and kind staff."
18,De Gouden Florijn, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice Amsterdam ""Bruin Caf√©"", however turning it into a sportsbar with 4 screens casting permanent sports is so not done. Just stick with turning on the tv, when there's an Ajax or Orange game on, not limited to the Orange football teams though."
19,De Gouden Florijn, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome location, very nice and warm people. We watched the world championship in a superfine atmosphere. We wish Nico and his friends all the best."
20,De Gouden Florijn, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A great place if you want to meet locals - this place is social class and age agnostic and a greatly diverse group of people meet here in the evenings. Besides beer and spirits you can also get some typical Dutch fingerfood.
