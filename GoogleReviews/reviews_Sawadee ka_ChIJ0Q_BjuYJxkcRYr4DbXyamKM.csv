0,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I very happy with my meal here tonight. It‚Äôs probably the best dinner I‚Äôve had so far this trip. I read the others reviews before ordering and finally settled on the shrimp green curry, primarily with fresh green beans, Asian miniature ‚Ä¶"
1,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food was delicious (we ate green and yellow curry), portions were huge. The atmosphere and staff very nice and friendly. Covid-19 recommendations were taken into account üëå"
2,Sawadee ka, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Quality declined a lot after pandemic. New staff is clueless, Chef is less talented and uses sugar in everything."
3,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The best Thai food place. Not expensive and very tasty, big portions. Here is just half of the portion of the main dish and finished soup."
4,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The pad thai Is the same as I have eating in thai.   11 euros Is affordable  cause one dish served two. Recommended
5,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very delicious food! We had delivered: a vegetarian green curry for me and pad Thai for my partner. The food arrived quickly and the portion sizes are just right for the price. I willbe ordering here more often for sure.
6,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious papaya salad, but not really spicy if you're used to eating Thai food regularly"
7,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My go-to Thai place for takeaway ! I haven‚Äôt had the pleasure to eat there because of Covid, but I‚Äôm sure that I would say this is the most authentic Thai place in Amsterdam, hands down. ‚Ä¶"
8,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,10 months ago,"I ordered a deal: 121b) Tjap tjai (deal)
overcooked slimy vegetables. (1 star). Not the  interesting Thai taste I'm used to of Sawaddee KA ‚Ä¶"
9,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Tasty Thai food for a low price. 4 stars for the taste / budget ratio. Service is a bit improvised with varying quality (be sure to be clear if you are in a hurry), but personnel is in general friendly. I've let the waiter chose for us ‚Ä¶"
10,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had this four weeks ago delivered and I have had it every week since. Its affordable (as far as Thai food in Amsterdam goes). Dishes are fragrant and flavourful, the more unsual stuff (Papaya salad, Fried Crispy Pork etc) is super suprising, no need to stick to regular favourites like Pad Thai and Massaman."
11,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food is good, as are the prices. Size of main dish we had (curry chicken) was enough for 2 people. Waitress during our dinner visit was alone and that was clearly too many tables to handle. Worth visiting - and revisiting to try different dishes."
12,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Excellent authentic Issan Thai cuisine.
13,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,6 days ago,Food and service very good üëç
14,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food, authentic and tasty. Decent prices. I was served by Elise who was professional and friendly. Her attentive to details attitude and sharp memories to recall every single customers that paid the visit beforehand are really impressive. Will re-visit this place."
15,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Decent value for money, good for groups. The only downside is that nearly all of our dishes were a little on the sweet side and service was a bit on the slow side.  That said,    the portions were very good. Would recommend,  if you don't mind the wait."
16,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was OK. Not as good as I was hoping for.
I have been to Thailand many times and Thai cuisine is fresh and simple. It shouldn't be so hard to make great and simple dish like fryed noodels with chicken ‚Ä¶"
17,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food but the service was unfortunately very slow, it took half an hour before we go the entree, ..I would  recommend it but dont go in if you are starving,  because the long wait does spoil the dining experience. I generally rate a ‚Ä¶"
18,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Good portion. Tasty food. Nice presentation.
19,Sawadee ka, 1 star ,2 years ago,"slow, the food was not fresh, far from Thai cuisine, poor menu explain, price is to hight - food is poor, meet was over fright, oil is bad taste. don't recomend it for real food lovers. frosen food with elements of fast food given in a slow motion. nothing personal just my opinion"
20,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty Thai food.
Portions are fairly large.
We had to wait to have the waiter available for us. It looks like the waiters have other roles in the backroom, but it might be beneficial to have a dedicated waiter."
21,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Found this place after spending most of the day at the Rijksmuseum on a Tuesday at 1645. The place looked deserted besides another couple, but I decided to give it a try. ‚Ä¶"
22,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pretty good. Nice atmosphere.
23,Sawadee ka, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"I am being generous giving 2 stars. We came here because of the review in The Guardian... I'm not sure how it managed to succeed to be featured. It took forever for our food to arrive, this wasn't slow - a slug may have moved faster. From ‚Ä¶"
24,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We found this little Thai joint on our way back to the hotel. Really good food and quick service! Would highly recommend to anyone who likes Thai food.
25,Sawadee ka, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was not great ‚Äì fairly bland, and mostly consisting of elderly frozen vegetables. Seems expensive for the quality. Service was very slow, and our drink order forgotten."
26,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Reasonable mix of authentic Thai food (try the papaya salad and ask for it 'ped ped'), and the usual Westernised fusion food. Facilities are basic, but ok. Not as pricey as other lower quality Thai places in Amsterdam"
27,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was alright, good portion, fair priced. The service was on and off, especially a younger waitress was very odd, even rude, treating customers differently. Needs more lighting inside the restaurant."
28,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Simple but spectacular when it comes to taste. However, be prepared to wait a bit longer for your dish and have proper cash with you as it seems that the cardreader never works."
29,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food is amazingly good and very well portioned. On plate is enough for two people. The staff was also very friendly. Will definitely come back!
30,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Pad Thai in Amsterdam, period! Believe me, I‚Äôve pretty much tried every Thai restaurant in the city but nothing comes even close to the Pad Thai they serve here ü§§üò±"
31,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Thai food, six people, 5 veggies and an Omni and we all loved it. If you're veggie and you love massaman ask for the beef to be replaced with tofu, it's divine."
32,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best Tom Kha soup I've ever had. The curry was great too but, that soup is worth the trip alone."
33,Sawadee ka, 1 star ,6 years ago,"I ate beef. After i had diarrhea all  2 days long and every hour once. It felt like my stomage needs completly stuff reset. Dont go there, really!!! My 3 days adam trip was wasted after."
34,Sawadee ka, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Slow service, below average food. Waited for an hour and 30 minutes for the pad thai and stir fried pork to arrive. Will not recommend."
35,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great food, sizeable dishes, possibly a little slow but worth it, as food was fresh and excellent. The veggie pad Thai and yellow curry were great."
36,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best authentic Thai food in Amsterdam with affordable price!  The atmosphere was nice üëç
37,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,8 years ago,It's okay. Not the worst Thai food and good serving size. Pleasant service. Not anywhere near authentic though.
38,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"While traveling the globe, my boyfriend and i stopped here before leaving for our next stop. I had the spring roll and  chicken satay, while my boyfriend had the chicken green curry. It was MARVELOUS."
39,Sawadee ka, 1 star ,5 years ago,Worse Tom yam I've ever tasted.. the bowl was so small and too much of coconut milk in it.. hardly could taste the Tom yam... not worth the visit
40,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent value for money. The food is genuine and the managers nice.
41,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place was nice. Location is good. Prices affordable, only 1 person to serve customers tho"

46,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"delicious food, lots of vegetarian options, friendly service, clean facilities, cheap prices - what more would you want?"
47,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Once I visit amsterdam I should come back here
48,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was not that bad, but unfortunately the service was terrible. Not much idea of customer service unfortunately it seems."
49,Sawadee ka, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The food was just alright. Doesn't taste authentic at all. The sitting arrangements and service is quite ok.
50,Sawadee ka, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The food was okay however asking 5 euros voor 0.75cl of water is ridiculous even in amsterdam.
51,Sawadee ka, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Really good and flavoursome food, but very slow service."
52,Sawadee ka, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty Thai food, good ambience and large portion sizes."
53,Sawadee ka, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Didnt even get my order after waiting 1,5 hour. Not recommending this for group more than 2 people.."
54,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Prices seemed high for what you get but this is Amsterdam. Good Thai food

59,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Sweet staff, somewhat blandly average unexciting Thai style food"
60,Sawadee ka, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was good, but it took way too long"
61,Sawadee ka, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Service is poor, not even taken order after 20 min of entering to resturent . Behaved unnecessarily rude"
