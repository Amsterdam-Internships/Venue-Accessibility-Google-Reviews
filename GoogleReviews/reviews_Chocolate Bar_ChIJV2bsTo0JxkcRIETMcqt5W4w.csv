1,Chocolate Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,I had a terrible experience at this place the other night. I arrived there with my wife and friend to grab a nachos and a beer. After our order the show with the waiter began. First he mistaken my friend's order...instead of bottled raddler ‚Ä¶
2,Chocolate Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy place, nice food and friendly staff."
3,Chocolate Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,Waited 10 minutes before being acknowledged and then after ordering waited over an hour for our meal only to find out after asking about it that the waiter had forgotten to ring it through. Asked for a credit on one of our cocktails as compensation.  He said no.  We told them to forget it and left. Worst service ever.
4,Chocolate Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Very long service ! About 35minutes for a salade and a burger. Moreover the quantity of the fries on the burger was soooo little. The toilets are dirty. But the waiters and waitresses are very nice
5,Chocolate Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,One of the trendy places to go in this area. Location is great and if nice weather u can enjoy sitting outside. I'm not so crazy about their food to be honest. I do now a days drinks and meeting up with friends here.
6,Chocolate Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best burger I've ever had!  Can't stop thinking about it.  Think it was called Chocoburger.  The service was really good too and nice to sit outside on a hot day!
