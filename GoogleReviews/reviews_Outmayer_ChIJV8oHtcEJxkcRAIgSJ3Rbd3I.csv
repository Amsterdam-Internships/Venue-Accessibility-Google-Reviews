0,Outmayer, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious cappuccino and hot chocolate. They work fast, Apple taart was delicious too. Large size cup was extra big:) people here are friendly"
1,Outmayer, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food wasn't really that good, staff were friendly ish. The staff member that served us forgot that our order was in the oven, therefore came out over cooked and slightly burnt. She only realised because another staff member asked for things from the oven which were another customers... had to wait minutes just to reheat something...."
2,Outmayer, 2 stars ,a year ago,"We bought a pizza slice, was good but have to wait very long to be warm.. but the brownie was disgusting, only the taste of plastic (cellophane) packaging. Terrible."
3,Outmayer, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was excellent, fresh coffee, cake and they make sandwiches up exactly how you would want them. We returned a couple of times during our trip. Definitely worth a visit!"
4,Outmayer, 1 star ,2 years ago,Apple pie was still frozen when it supposedly warmed to serve. I sent it back and second time the base still had ice in the pastry. I was offered a substitute and chose a Danish pastry which was essentially stale. No votes.
5,Outmayer, 1 star ,3 years ago,"That's the worst choice I could have made. Such expensive, dry and off bakery. The waitress who served us was rude. It's no a nice place. Non recommendable at all."
6,Outmayer, 1 star ,5 years ago,Staff were unfriendly. Ordered strawberry tart and mocca pie. Both tasted like overdue pastries. Will not come here again for sure.
7,Outmayer, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Staff have no manners, tables were full of used cutlery while the 3 girls at the counter just talked, when one did come and clear the tables she didn't bother to wipe them (crumbs everywhere!) Won't be visiting again!"
8,Outmayer, 1 star ,2 years ago,Shocking!! Bad service wrong order given out cold and waited forever. What’s the point in gloves when it’s through your hair then food then money then food again
