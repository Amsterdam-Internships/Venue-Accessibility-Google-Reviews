1,Toasty!, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, simple menu, great coffee and tasty toasts ü§© Definitely recommended!"
2,Toasty!, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very good coffee and great croissants. Lovely service.
3,Toasty!, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Cute cafe. Nice coffee. Cozy decor
4,Toasty!, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place for breakfast! There is quite enough choice on the menu and the toast are soooo good! The best we have tried was Sofietje Panini and BTCC; Chicken Ticino and Steack & Cheese were also nice. They do it at the moment you order it with fresh ingredients and are not stingy with quantities.
5,Toasty!, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely Italian coffee shop. Has free wifi. Friendly staff. Quick service. Comfortable benches. We only stopped for coffee, which was Illy brand coffee. Beautiful design and extremely light and foamy Creme."
6,Toasty!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is nice and warm. the staff was honest when he didn't have an ingredient he informed us instead of making it blindly
7,Toasty!, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious delicious crema coffee! I was brought here by an italian and I fell in love with the coffee. Looking forward to coming back!
8,Toasty!, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This restaurant is very simple, but the food is great. I had the ""Freeky Pear"" and it was delicious! A nice place to go and have lunch to. Vondelpark is also very close."

11,Toasty!, 5 stars ,8 months ago,The food is good and it was prepared quickly. I‚Äôm very happy with it. There‚Äôs a small area outside where you can wait for it to be prepared. Very nice.
12,Toasty!, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicous food , clean place , nice servis. Thank you !"
13,Toasty!, 1 star ,3 years ago,Surprised by the high ratings this place got. Went here for a quick bite during lunch. They have a couple of small tables on the street and some inside. ‚Ä¶
14,Toasty!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent breakfast place with Illy coffee
15,Toasty!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Not only toasts! They offer awesome fresh-made juices! It is right outside the park so it is the perfect stop for lunch. The toasts are made in front of you and the staff is super-efficient.
16,Toasty!, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This place is a joke, the waiter explain you that they have orange-banana juices and banana or strawberries smoothies and comes to the table with a orange-banana juice saying it‚Äôs a SMOOTHIE. Well, we might not be local but we are not ‚Ä¶"

18,Toasty!, 5 stars ,10 months ago,The best toasty in Amsterdam!!! Served with excellent hospitality üòä I will never forget this taste of memory in my lifeüòé
19,Toasty!, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I would never expect to find a store dedicated to tostys, but now I understand why. We very much enjoyed our New York choice. The place is very simplistic (you won't go there to be inspired), but the food and coffee were great"
20,Toasty!, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We have to wait forever for a table because we need to get a table to eat. And the staff asked us to sit at the sofa without table instead. The people occupied all the tables with their laptop and chatting, no sense of awareness with the surrounding."

22,Toasty!, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good place for breakfast or a quick lunch
23,Toasty!, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Waited forever for just two toasts. Not really friendly personel, lied to us that the toast was in the toaster while they even needed to start making it. Not recommended if you just want a quick toast"
