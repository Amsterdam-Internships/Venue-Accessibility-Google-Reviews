0,Pastis, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Nice French bistrot in West on two floors and a terrace that on a sunny day must be amazing. The place is quite small but with lots of tables, so the atmosphere is vibrant and alive. The menu is on one page, not so many options but a …"
1,Pastis, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Good bread and entrance . Small menu. Portions are quite French (super small)…
2,Pastis, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Most authentic french restaurant in Amsterdam. One of the best Steak dishes I have had! Great ambiance also

5,Pastis, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice decor, nice atmosphere, but definitely overpriced.  The pretentiousness of the menu is not matched by the quality of the food, which is just average.  It might be worth it at 25-30% less that what it costs.
The bread is very good."
6,Pastis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Simple, classic French good food.
We loved the escargot, beef tartare.
The main course options are great too - salmon, steak, seabass - on the smallish …"
7,Pastis, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"The staff are nice and the place is pretty and clean but that's it. The food is regular, nothing special about it. My ceasar salad was okay, but a loottt of items missing in it. My friends got 'steak' - we would not define it as a steak and …"

A simple bistro that is very good in what is does, I have had almost everything they have on their fixed menu and nothing dissapoints, all is very well executed. This is also a very nice spot to have a drink in the sun."
11,Pastis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Has the feel and look of a real French bistro. With the staff being attentive, with good knowledge of wine and what they’re serving. The upstairs area, which looks the most “authentic” is very hot though. There’s an airco but you don’t feel …"

17,Pastis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The bisque was tasty but was not what I expected loving bisque. It was sort of de-constructed with several pieces of fresh fish, mash potatoes with the bisque sort of a light sauce around it all.  I wanted more sauce/bisque! The salad was …"
