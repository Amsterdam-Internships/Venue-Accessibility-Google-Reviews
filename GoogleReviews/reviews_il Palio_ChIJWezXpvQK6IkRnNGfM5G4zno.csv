3,il Palio, 2 stars ,2 months ago,This place is just ok. It's cozy and nice inside and that's about it. I paid $22 for a flat bread that had no meat or seafood on it. Not sure if that's because of Biden's inflation or if that is the normal price. It's REALLY expensive and …

29,il Palio, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Good ambience, but pricey food and not up to scratch. I frequently make risotto at home and often try out new types in the restaurant to get inspired. In this case the risotto was mushy and overcooked, far too much safron taste and with dry pieces of salmon looking like pork scratchings. Probably the worst risotto dish I ever had."

54,il Palio, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Very pricey, small portions, food was not good enough to justify the price.  My meal was cavateli with sausage and broccoli. The sauce was flavorful.   My wife got the prime rib, the meat was good quality, but the sauce wasn't that great. …"
55,il Palio, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent restaurant! Visited for lunch and was impressed with both the service and food. Friendly staff. Didn't have reservations but was able to get a table (2) however I highly recommend a reservation especially for dinner. Upscale atmosphere. Smart casual would be minimum attire.
56,il Palio, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great atmosphere whether sitting at the bar or in dining room.  The service is excellent.  The menu has a lot to offer and usually the staff can assist with your choices. If you are inclined to try a few appetizers and salads they don't mind the shareable aspect.
57,il Palio, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Never had such a gracious host in the chef in the kitchen is unbelievable all fresh herbs of fresh pasta and bread‘s.

63,il Palio, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I think their food is very good but not great. The couple of times I have gone when it comes out it is warm and not hot. I do think they have great desserts which is why I have given them 4stars instead of 3. Atmosphere is nice and the wait staff is good as well. Overall good but could be improved.
64,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Attended a 50th anniversary party here and Il Palio did an excellent job of hosting.

Are go to for take out and delivery."
72,il Palio, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was awesome (joe) .  Veal entree phenomenal. Burratta was good, less tomatoes and maybe a fruit (watermelon/peaches/onion) would have been good in it.  I had a last minute order to go for my son and they took it with no issues even with the kitchen closing.  I'll be back.  I wish the bar was larger."
73,il Palio, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So far, I've been there twice with a few others and nd each time was very pleasant.

100,il Palio, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice Shelton restaurant. Like this place everytime. They have a new lunch special which includes app meal & dessert. Califlour soup was a little bland and salmon tasted like it was cooked on a burned grill.

106,il Palio, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Probably the best Italian restaurant in Fairfield County, if not Connecticut.

They usually have a 3-course lunch special for $12.95 that is a super deal!"
