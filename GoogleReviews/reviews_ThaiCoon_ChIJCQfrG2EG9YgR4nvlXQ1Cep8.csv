The food was eclectic, nicely presented and delicious."

16,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been dining here monthly. The place is always full, the parking is extremely limited expect to park two deep. The sashimi so fresh, sushi rolls artfully create this time I got the Imagine roll. The staff here is always top notch. I ordered a plum wine.. it came with a small blob of plum in it. THAT was my only complaint."

22,ThaiCoon, 1 star ,4 months ago,My wife's chicken teriyaki was so runny and gross she couldn't even eat it and the pad ki mao doesn't have meat as one of the ingredients but when I got all the way home I find out it has chicken in it. Not cool.
23,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"I really liked the rolls this time. Delicious. Strongly recommended. Also a great shout out to the staff for accommodating two young babies They went above and beyond and really helped a pair of new parents, unlike some of the patrons who ‚Ä¶"
24,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Came here for lunch and had some of the best sushi I've ever had (Hawaiian roll pictured). The prices are very reasonable given the portion sizes - a single 8 piece roll and a seaweed salad was an extremely filling lunch. I was able to get in and out quickly, and the restaurant had a lovely ambiance."

34,ThaiCoon, 2 stars ,11 months ago,It‚Äôs decent. At best. I am surprised this got such good reviews. Shocked actually. There has got to be much better and authentic Thai places in Atlanta. Can‚Äôt totally speak to their sushi. But Thai food would be a waste of time and money. ‚Ä¶

36,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,10 months ago,I've only had my Chardonnay so far and I'm in love with this place. The menu is incredible and very descriptive but it's also not overboard. The children's menu looks great and my daughter is pumped. My girlfriend was born here in Marietta ‚Ä¶

47,ThaiCoon, 1 star ,a year ago,The food was alright. Not great. I was a little upset because my husband and I ordered the beef and shrimp Pad Thai to go. They literally gave me only one shrimp and a few pieces of beef with my order. My husband had three pieces or shrimp ‚Ä¶

49,ThaiCoon, 4 stars ,4 years ago,4star sushi. 3star thai entree. Great service. Calm cool ambience. We will return.
50,ThaiCoon, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Service was on point. The spicy tuna salad was excellent as was the seaweed salad. The Red curry sauce was tasty but the chicken that was added to it was bland and rubbery. Still not terrible. My wife said the Tom Ka Ga soup was yummy :-) ‚Ä¶

53,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,a year ago,First time in a long time since I've been in the Marietta area and I met up with some friends. My friend suggested Thaicoon and it was amazing! I ordered the Pa-nang chicken curry and it was 5/5. I normally don't order curry due to the excessive sauce but this was an exception. I would go back again if I ever do swing by the area.
54,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Easily the best sushi I've had in Atlanta! Ask for the fire roll (it's not on the menu, but trust me on this one) and the mango sticky rice. ‚Ä¶"
55,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Always great food and friendly knowledgeable staff. The only place I eat sushi from anymore and a great place to get Thai food. Lamb chops are my weakness. ‚Ä¶

58,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love Thaicoon! 2 minutes from our house, and we regularly go once a week for take out. Love the coconut soup with chicken. Also, for those who are able to eat in at lunch time, their lunch special comes with soup or salad. Great prices & great people!"
59,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Doesn't look like much from the outside but the service, atmosphere and food are amazing! Menu is SUPER extensive and very reasonably priced.

68,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Monday and Tuesday they have a reduced price sushi menu that is extremely affordable! Quality sushi, with plenty of Thai dishes offered as well if someone in your group does not eat sushi. Recommend the ""Bear Lover"" roll, smoked salmon is so good!"
69,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Surprisingly great. This place is in a bit of an odd location, so I was immediately surprised to find that the restaurant was crowded and actually very nice on the inside. The food was tasty and the prices very reasonable. I ordered a large ‚Ä¶"

75,ThaiCoon, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Sushi was really good but the pad-thai left a lot to be desired.
76,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,a year ago,A favorite location for delicious thai food. Stopped in on a Monday I think. Prices were appropriate.

83,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Came here with a group of friends after class on Monday for their Dollar Sushi menu. We made jokes about their new fish coming in on Wednesday and this is why Monday and Tuesday sushi is so inexpensive. It didn't taste like it tho! My ‚Ä¶
84,ThaiCoon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I work across the street from the restaurant so order often. However, was not satisfied the last 2 times I ordered. The pepper steak lunch was bland, no real seasoning, no salt. I had to add salt and some soy sauce and eel sauce to give it ‚Ä¶"

The Tom Kha Kai is good too. But I love sushi so that's what I usually order. ‚Ä¶"
89,ThaiCoon, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Their food was alright. They definitely don‚Äôt know how to do tofu. The service was not good, the people were rude and stand offish. Also found a hair in my food. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, won‚Äôt be coming back either. Try the Marietta Square location - their service is better."
90,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fine place for quality Thai food. Visited Fri evening I think. The staff was very friendly and kind. It has a nice interior. Feeling here is similar to a place in Columbus I liked.
91,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I am mixed as I post this, one of my favorite places but don't want everyone to swarm there. Sushi is excellent as are the Thai entrees.  Hot Rod roll is my go-to roll. Hamaci Toro is worth every penny and bite."
92,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Outstanding place for tasty Thai food. Entered near nine, it wasn't busy. I think I might become a regular. This place has many great reviews for a reason."

98,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is a hidden gem. From the outside you wouldn't think the place was amazing, but it is. The sushi is top grade and the calamari is some of the best I've had even when I've paid three times as much at other places."
99,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great sushi! We eat from here all the time. If you're calling in an order you probably will have to try multiple times to get through which can be annoying. But worth it.
100,ThaiCoon, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Service was great as was the ambience. Sort of a cabin cozy feel and very open floor plan. The menu was pretty long but it was organized well into apps, Thai plates, and sushi so pretty navigable. We got the secret bag which was like a crab ‚Ä¶"
101,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We had the Spicy Salmon roll and the Shrimp Tempera roll (with a side of fried rice) all of it was REALLY GOOD and affordable! And it was filling!!! This place is highly recommended. This will my go to this spot whenever I am in Atlanta.

106,ThaiCoon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The agedashi is the worst I have had. How you mess that up is amazing to me (and to charge over $5 is even more deplorable). The fried rice was basic and bland. The spicy shrimp soup was ok. Three stars is VERY generous.
107,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best sushi I've had. Service was excellent. Decor, ambiance & music was just right.(no, I'm not a relative !). I've been to a hundred different sushi restaurants,  but this is the nicest I've encountered."

111,ThaiCoon, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"We went here with some friends for some variety since we are vegan and they aren't. We tried the spicy tofu fried rice--no egg, no fish sauce, etc --pad kee mao, and spicy basil with tofu. All the food was delicious but the spicy tofu rice ‚Ä¶"

113,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We love this place.  We come for the special Sunday menu which is unlike anything you've ever had.  The papaya salad is to die for and true authentic.  They are very accommodating with our toddler too.
114,ThaiCoon, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"I've had the opportunity of visiting Tycoon in 3 different occasions with my wife. All 3 times we had a very friendly service, and the food was real good but not as Hot Spicy as I like, although still good. ‚Ä¶"

125,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very stylish restaurant with a very adventuresome selection. Everything is so well done, I've never had anything that was not perfect. For a fun and delicious dinner, try the steak panang special that comes in the clay pot."
126,ThaiCoon, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Been here many times and have never had a issue ever. Haven‚Äôt tried everything on the menu so I can‚Äôt speak for all their food. But they have the best dang massaman curry i‚Äôve ever had. and i‚Äôve tried many from different restaurants.
