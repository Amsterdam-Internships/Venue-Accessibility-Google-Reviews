0,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place with a great barman.
There is a real atmosphere here.
You can clearly see that previous customers have had a great time, as they have ‚Ä¶"
1,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Stopped by this bar since they had Brandt wheat beer on tap. The bartender was very nice and we enjoyed talking to him. I recommend this place for sure.
2,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First time in town, hungover hungry and sleep deprived. Cafe De Zeeneeuw was a nice place to get out of the craziness and relax with good 80's mix. Nice dive bar. Okay now that I'm drunk and had a moment to recharge I'm gonna head back out! Cheers!"
3,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely little find. Quiet little pub. Reasonably priced and family feel in there. Random but amazing decor. Had a chat with the female behind the bar, very friendly and cheerful. It was Christmas we were over here and the locals were brilliantly friendly and welcoming."
4,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Quiet little pub - I guess it was their off time. I enjoyed a drink and a conversation with the owner. You gotta love these long-standing family businesses.
5,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome little bar . Bar man was amazing we talked about football for ages . Really good atmosphere.  The bar has old football shirts stuck to the roof and coasters with written messages on . Definitely worth going for a beer and a chat .  P.s (And yes ajax vs liverpool would have been a better CL final )
6,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great little pub/cafe with some of the friendliest staff in Amsterdam. Beer mats can be signed and placed onto the walls so some fun times searching for your old beer mats and reading others. Overall this is probably my favourite place to drink and if I lived there it would be my local
7,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,a year ago,WE LOVE SYLVIA! Zeemeeuw is a sweet little bar tucked in a corner of the Red Light district. It‚Äôs only bar tender is the sweetest woman I‚Äôve ever met. The drinks are well priced and the music is good! The seating is ample for the crowd. My group of 6 sat comfortably and kept coming back!

9,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Sylvia, the bartender, is amazing! She is very caring and friendly. Came into town for 5 days and came back to visit her a second time before we left. Highly recommend if you enjoy small and intimate setting that offers a fun environment."
10,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Relaxed, welcoming vibe. The bartender gets a little grumpy when overwhelmed but is a sweetheart really. Far enough from the main attractions of the red light district not to get completely overwhelmed with patrons on a weekend night and drinks are average in price."
11,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"From N.ireland came in February,19 back again in August,19 for birthday treat.

13,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a small dive type bar just on the outskirts of the red light district in Amsterdam. If you are a soccer fan you will be pleased with the decor, as the cieling is completely covered with a variety of soccer jerseys. There also other ‚Ä¶"
14,Cafe De Zeemeeuw, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The waitress was not very friendly. We asked for a cappucino and she replied: we have coffee,if u want you add the milk!
