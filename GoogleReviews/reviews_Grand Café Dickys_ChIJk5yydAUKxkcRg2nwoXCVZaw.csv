0,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"I have been to Dickys Grand Café with two of my friends. We ordered finger food, which was really tasty and the service was great. Especially, as one of my friends requested some special cheese on her fries and the waitress did her best to organize it. The drinks were refreshing as well."
1,Grand Café Dickys, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,Was informed that the restaurant was open for dinner and I made a reservation. When we got there they made us order right away because the kitchen was closed (even though on the phone I specifically made a reservation for dinner and was on time). Waiters were disorganized and forgot half our order. Then I found a hair in my salad.
2,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,The last couple of years the place has been renovated. Perfect ambiance for after work drinks
3,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Can imagine it's a cool place, but definitely wasn't designed for as many people as it gets"
4,Grand Café Dickys, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good for take away lunch. Not so much for eating in.

The take away lunch sandwiches are super fast prepared and friendly staff. …"
5,Grand Café Dickys, 3 stars ,3 months ago,Went for a beer between 16 and closing and the volume was ridiculously loud. Basically have to yell to your table. Staff is very friendly.
6,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,a year ago,Wonderfull as always. We noticed there was a tiny piecy of cork in one of the wine glasses. We immediately got 2 new glasses of wine and some extra pieces of hot wings to make up even further. We go out for drinks here at least once a week …
7,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for drinks after a long working day. Good beers ( try Ij wit but not too much, strong beer with great taste). The menu is sufficient and the staff is always happy to have a word with you. Definitely a great place to relax that can get busy on Thursday, Friday and of course any other sunny day."
8,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Good sandwich for lunch, nice atmosphere on the terrace outside. Slightly slow service, but this was during a busy lunch, so not too much of an issue."
9,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Arguably the best burger place in Zuidas. Went there for the first time in an year and the quality of the Dicky's burger is still fantastic
10,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the pillars of zuidas nightlife and Friday afternoon drinks. They have a wide selection of beers, wines and I believe also some cocktails. Additionally, they also serve some very nice snacks but also full dishes. Greta for the Friday night!"
11,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Too much crowded on a Thursdays and Fridays. Very good place to chit chat with colleagues along with a glass of wine or a beer during the evening at this place is fun. Price is comparable to any other place close by Amsterdam Zuid. Snacks and starters are also nice, not much veg options though"
12,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I visited Dicky's today and can say that the food was lovely, the service was prompt and also the manager Qnca was very friendly and helpful in her demeanour and professional throughout. Will be eating here again for sure"
13,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Like this place a lot, cozy and romantic at the same time. Staff is really kind. The only negative thing is that it gets really crowded after work especially thursdays full of pretentious young business personnel. If you avoid the crowd, you will have good time :)"
14,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,4 years ago,One of the crowded pub near busiest business place of Amsterdam zuid. Great accessibility. Spacious from both inside and outside. Good snacks. Average priced. Free wifi and good beers.
15,Grand Café Dickys, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Recommended a for a drink and a chat after work. It's not a bad  place, but I'm giving it 3 stars as both times I went it was much emptier than the other bars in the area."
16,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great staff and owners. Not great crowd that comes here.
17,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good place to sit down for a coffee meeting, have lunch at or spend your Friday night together with the - what feels like - other zuid as employees."
18,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Was here on Friday evening... It's very much packed with crowd for after work drinks, but loved that the staff roams around the whole restaurant to take your orders, which earns 5 stars for me …"
19,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, fun atmosphere and a party place!"
20,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Surprisingly empty at lunch while there was a long line next door. Tried the carpaccio sandwich and kept coming back for it, even risking to miss my plane. Service was pleasant but not particularly fast"
21,Grand Café Dickys, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely friendly atmospheric place.Staff were great. Relaxing drink, ran a tab and no need to leave my card for safety. Relaxed atmosphere in the busy tech part of Amsterdam Zuidas. Ideal for a quick one after work or to have one nipping out from your local hotel."
22,Grand Café Dickys, 1 star ,2 years ago,The food is not bad for lunch. Came in after words to ask for some help and the staff was so unfriendly and disrespectful  i will never go back there now with my lunch meetings.
23,Grand Café Dickys, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It can be very crowded here, but the menus are affordable and quickly served. For speeches you better go outside to the terrace."
