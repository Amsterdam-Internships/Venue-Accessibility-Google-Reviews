0,La Madonna, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Super tasty food ü§§  I really recommend this place. After renovation it's look gorgeous ‚ù§Ô∏èüëå doesn't matter what do you order, everything has really aromatic and unique taste."
1,La Madonna, 5 stars ,a month ago,Best Italian in the Amsterdam and good prices.
2,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 months ago,"This experience confirms- never have a meal on the busy central street in Amsterdam- it will be expensive and quite unpleasant.

3,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 months ago,"‚Ç¨11.50 for the the tiniest jack & coke, about 250ml for ‚Ç¨11.50. the food is fine but they are overcharging on drinks like idiots, that one miniature glass cost less than dinner there."
4,La Madonna, 3 stars ,4 years ago,It's ok. Waited about an hour for our pizza order. It was a good Italian pie made like in Italy. The H41 was different. The restaurant is probably over rated and makes money only due to the high traffic location. On a different street it ‚Ä¶
5,La Madonna, 1 star ,2 years ago,Avoid avoid avoid - only visit if you like microwave frozen food and chicken pizza which has gone brown like beef from the long time that it was deep frozen.. we had 4 simple dishes including a pizza which were all frozen and microwaved. No alcohol 71euros... Best of luck.
6,La Madonna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was absolutely delicious. The staff very friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed it. Don't worry if you don't speak the language.
7,La Madonna, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Good for salty food not for desserts.

10,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Avoid AVOID!!
Me and my wife waited for steak and fish aprox 50mins. And get food cold. Waitress don't know menu. Haven't asked how to do make steak. And brought cold. ‚Ä¶"
11,La Madonna, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Nice food with a great treatment ‚ô•Ô∏è
12,La Madonna, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The pizza was fine, not the best but it was good.  The waiters are grumpy like they hate their job.
Service was okay."
13,La Madonna, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Really tasty pizza, kind service, familylike atmosphere. Just great"
14,La Madonna, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very good place with best pizza. We come back here again.
15,La Madonna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good promotion, the chicken has a very good texture and flavor. Excelent attention from part of the waitress."
16,La Madonna, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Don't go !
The worst italian restaurant in Amsterdam
Frozen meals ‚Ä¶"
17,La Madonna, 4 stars ,a week ago,Got a pizza which was pretty good.
18,La Madonna, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The steak was very good but unfortunately the sauce was cold? Didn't make any sense.
19,La Madonna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful place for romantic date with cute and talented attendants. The table set up, tasty food and especially the classy plate decoration wooed us more. The service is impeccable and smooth. Totally recommend it for rejuvenating time and experience with affordable price. We had 3 course menu with few drinks and all this was within 50‚Ç¨"
20,La Madonna, 1 star ,2 years ago,"TERRIBLE. Waiter with bad attitude, waited 45 minutes for a personal pizza until I decided to leave. Paid almost 20 Euros for bad glass of wine, a beer, and 2 flat Cokes.  It's better to starve than to go there."
21,La Madonna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Soups: 10/10 MADE MY DAY, best place to eat hot, spicy, delicious soup. Best thing when its cold and rainy outside. Big portion and hot, crispy bun. <3 (tomato soup best one) ‚Ä¶"
22,La Madonna, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Pizza tasted like it was frozen, but not even a good frozen one. The 15euro chicken cutlet was either rubbery or undercooked. The carbonara was bland and don‚Äôt know why tagliatelle is extra charge when it‚Äôs also not fresh. We stopped here ‚Ä¶"
23,La Madonna, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ill giving 2 starts because the food was good. But the service was very very bad. I never write bad reviews and I work in this industry as well and I know how stressful it can be. ‚Ä¶
24,La Madonna, 4 stars ,2 months ago,Nice place to eat Italian pasta. It was good.
25,La Madonna, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Risotto is just plain white rice with a bit of tomato sauce on top. Salad was so bad, with litre of vinegar and frozen green beans, that we sent it back. Had really good campari with orange juice even though it cost 9 Euro. Judging by the amount of food left on other people's plates - pizzas aren't great either."
26,La Madonna, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Pizza was fairly good. The fries seemed over priced considering they tasted of cheap oil. The beer was also flat and I'm fairly sure it was watered down. One of the waitresses was lovely the other seemed void of life. Over all it was an ok resterant but not good you get what you pay for.
27,La Madonna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food and nice waitresses.
28,La Madonna, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Not really a genuine italian restaurant per se, but the food is still good. Not sure what to say about the staff though; they're almost on the verge of being unfriendly in an unintentional way...I dont think they actively try to be, but ‚Ä¶"
29,La Madonna, 1 star ,2 years ago,We waited more than 30 minutes for a soup that wasnt very good. The waiter was very arrogant and not very kind. The water and soup were extremly overpriced. The chicken steak was overcooked and almost rock hard. The rice was very dry and tomato sauce too. I really don't reccomend going there.
30,La Madonna, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The muscles  in cream sauce were amazing, but the baked ravioli was a little dry. I was absolutely starving and it got the job done, but I would chance it again. Maybe the oven was on the fritz??? The service was solid. I didn't have to ‚Ä¶"
31,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 years ago,"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. Avoid like the plague. The staff are so rude its unbelievable but for good food we could easily look past that. Sadly, that is not the case. The food took a long time to come and was voted as the WORST ‚Ä¶"
32,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food was just decent, not bad but definitely not good. This big guy that served us did not know what a serving is, if your attitude is so bad, you shouldn't work at a restaurant. So many other choices in Amsterdam, highly recommend people to not come."
33,La Madonna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous experience, very friendly staff. Restaurant is very clean and offers a good selection of meals. Vegetarian options available. We had Vegetable soup and minestrone followed with beef in anchovy souce (delicious) There is room for ‚Ä¶"
34,La Madonna, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Avoid this place, clearly aimed at tourists. Food quality is way below average based off frozen vegetables rendering water all over the pizza. Overpriced wine. Service was ok."
35,La Madonna, 1 star ,a year ago,"Fraud. Don't go. It's terrible and you'll regret it. Very overpriced and very low quality. This restaurant only lives on by frauding tourists.
I'm disgusted by their morals. The worst experience we had in the wonderful city of Amsterdam."
36,La Madonna, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"- Reasonable priced food - comes in big portions - tastes fine

La Madonna is a great restaurant/pizzaria if you want a reasonably cheap meal ‚Ä¶"
37,La Madonna, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I felt a little cramped sitting there.  The staff was nice but barely spoke English and it took about 2 minutes too many to order because of that.  Food was just ok, nothing special.  No water, only bottled.  No bread given at all, maybe that's just an American thing?"
38,La Madonna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food and perfect location! After a long walk in Amsterdam I was really looking for some good food and when I got here I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is cosy, the staff was very helpful and the prices were decent. I don't see why anyone would be unhappy with this place."
39,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Even if the food was decent, the waiter couldn't be more rude. I had to order for me and my mom (because she only speaks Spanish and not English) and the waiter had the nerve to ask  her in the most rude tone if she was ok with me think for ‚Ä¶"
40,La Madonna, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Neither the food, nor the service in this restaurant were even close to okay.
We only went there once, so it might have been a bad day or the wrong choice of menu but the salads and pasta were terribly cheap, partly spoiled and badly ‚Ä¶"

42,La Madonna, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very delicious food, we were well recieved and well served, our questions were always welcome and the prices were acceptable. I highly recommend it"
43,La Madonna, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was poor. Edible but not something you would want to pay to eat. Service was good and pretty fast. Amsterdam has so many better places.
44,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The attitude of the 2 male waiters wasn't nice. The pizza de spinaci was served warm and the spinach cold. Wasn't allowed to drink my own water, won't serve tap water and my only option was buy their bottled water. As soon they cleared the ‚Ä¶"
45,La Madonna, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Typical tourist restaurant,  not very authentic Italian fare, spag carbonara too salty, garlic bread? more like tasteless cardboard . I guess it was quiet when I was there but still don't appreciate being watched while I eat."
46,La Madonna, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Where to start... Decor was dated, smell of animals in the main area only got worse towards the back and toilet area. Whole place felt dirty which was only enhanced by the toilets which were disgusting (and while I was using, a member of ‚Ä¶"
47,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 years ago,"NO JUST NO

If I could give less stars than one I would do it.. My friend ordered a caprese ‚Ä¶"
48,La Madonna, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Ok at best. Can not possibly be an Italian cook. Spaghetti Carabonara was decent. Prosciutto e melone was crazy! Pineapple! And drizzled in a balsamic sauce. Pizza dough was cooked will but lacked a decent flavor. More like a break dough. ‚Ä¶
49,La Madonna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had the fillet gorgonzola and my gf had the pepperoni pizza, with a bottle of wine and a tiramasou for dessert, we were well satisfied with our meals and the service, a nice little place, hidden away for a quiet meal"
50,La Madonna, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I picked 1 star because there isnt an option for 0 stars. We waited patiently for 1 hour and 30 mins and still our food didnt arrive. On top of that, service was absolutely horrible. A whole other group left the restaurant as well."
51,La Madonna, 5 stars ,a month ago,Nice food
52,La Madonna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I‚Äôve been there to have a coffee and the stuff were very kind and sweet . I saw many customer were enjoyed with food and i enjoyed my Moccachino as well by Luka. Don‚Äôt forget to ask for Lukacchino ( Moccachino by Luka ) Hahahah
53,La Madonna, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Food was good, toilets were okay (clean) and the stuff was very friendly. With no high expectations we were pleasantly suprised. If you are looking for an average pizza this is the restaurant to go!"
54,La Madonna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent food and excellent service. Will definitely visit again. Very child friendly also and they do have a high chair but no child's menu.
55,La Madonna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent service, 1/2 chicken very well seasoned alla italiana + a delicious mediterranean salad & soda for $15 is a really good deal."
56,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 years ago,"It is a typical tourists reataurest on Rembrandt  Plein. The food was okish... Service okish...
But what I hate is that they refuse to serve tap water even though we ordered food, coffee and other soft drinks."
57,La Madonna, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there with my family. Friendly stuff , amazing service and food was so DELICIOUS. Will be back soon to Le Madonna to experience this wonderful taste of food. ‚Ä¶"
58,La Madonna, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"THe staff are very friendly . The food is fabulous. There is a particular young lady if i am not mistaken by the name Danika or Danise, she is very friendly and keen to assure that the food,service, and everthing is going well. Bej back in July"

74,La Madonna, 1 star ,3 years ago,Crappy food. Pasta over cooked. 3 different dishes and they all taste the same. An insult to any decent Italian food lover
