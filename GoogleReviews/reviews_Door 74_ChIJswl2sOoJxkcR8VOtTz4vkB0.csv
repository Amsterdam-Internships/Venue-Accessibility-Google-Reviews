0,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Initially I booked a table, to which we couldn’t make it! We came to check out the place without reservation, which was clear to us we might not find a spot. The hostess was super nice and let us in telling us we need to stand until a table …"
1,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Highly recommend. Julian & crew are top notch. Thanks for all your hospitality & looking forward to working the door next time for a couple hours!
2,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cozy bar with a speak easy concept that came from the US. Bartenders are very friendly and know their way around cocktails. Great signature cocktails, but they're also happy to take up the challenge for a more custom sort. A tiny bit expensive would be the only downside of this place."
3,Door 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Recommend making a reservation. We showed up around 11pm without one and got lucky after another table left. Creative cocktails and cozy interior make for a great hideout with a small group or on a date. A nice escape from the party bars in nearby Rembrandt square.
4,Door 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Interesting underground place for cocktails in the city Center of Amsterdam. We got some nice cocktails, the experience its quite uique. You can go there only with reservation."
5,Door 74, 5 stars ,a year ago,Such a cool cocktail place. The staff is extremely friendly and the bartender is very skilled - the cocktails were delicious.
6,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We celebrated our anniversary here and they gave us celebratory shots! We had a really tasty mezcal cocktail in the skull glass which was very cool! A great sharing cocktail :)
7,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"בר קוקטיילים מעולה! הכניסה אליו לא קלה במיוחד, צריך לצלצל בפעמון של דלת 74 (כן כן, זה לא בניין מגורים).
הצוות אדיר, המשקאות מצויינים והאווירה קלילה וזורמת. היו פתוחים גם בערב הכריסמס! …"
8,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The cocktails are very good. We sat at the bar and chatted with the manager who was really nice, answering our questions about genever in the netherlands. The place is also very cosy and warm!"
9,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely authentic speak-easy with great signature cocktails comparable to those in Manhattan. My favourite was the Chicken Crossroads
10,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Awesome speakeasy cocktail bar with a very special feel, highly recommend visiting if you get in 😉."
11,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,WOW very cool cocktail bar! First you will need to find how to get in but you will figure it out when you get there ;). Second the place inside is very cozy and welcoming. They don't serve food so don't come on empty stomach but they do put …
12,Door 74, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Have been a few times and the last visit was rather disappointing. Booked in advance, acceptance at the door, but with some difficulty after booking and gave the idea that the place would be packed, it wasn't (we had booked anyway). …"
13,Door 74, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I’ve read some reviews on what the service is like etc but I wanted to get my own experience. I’m literally sitting in this bar, waiting for our cocktails. We ordered 2 cocktails at the same time. One came after 30 minutes and the other one …"
14,Door 74, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great cocktail bar - interesting signature cocktails and very talented international (not Dutch) staff. They can basically make any cocktail you prefer. Small intimate setting. Door 74 can only cater to around 22 persons at a time. …
15,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The cocktails are a little expensive (€15) but well worth it. They are expertly balanced and use unique ingredients. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The space is cozy but the booths and tables can easily handle groups of 4.
16,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Enjoyed this cozy place with my girls. Perfect way to finish the day and relaxed. Warm welcome from the staff members and they made sure we were having a delighted time. Loren is super pro and creative.
17,Door 74, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious specialty cocktails, plus they'll happily make you the regular ones! Really kind and attentive service."
18,Door 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice reservation-only speakeasy bar behind regular door. Creative cocktails, friendly staff."
19,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent speakeasy style bar. You must text ahead of time to make a reservation. The staff was very friendly and the cocktails were well crafted.
20,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing staff and great drinks. A little trick to find, but there’s a door one down that has a sign to not ring that bell so you know you’re close when you see that. Also they use noodles for straws, so eco :)"
21,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place, amazing cocktails and awesome service and atmosphere! Will most definitely visit again!"
22,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cocktails are expensive (14€ each) and reservation is desirable if you go on ""rush"" hours. But worth spending sometime here. Not at all disappointed."
23,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had to book to get in. This ensured we had a great time. Bartender was knowledgeable and was interesting to listen to (I think his name was Monty). He introduced the idea and current theme for the place with good presentation and was able …
24,Door 74, 1 star ,a year ago,"I had booked a table for two, but we were forced to sit at the bar. The girl who was in charge was very rude and kept repeating that they are the best cocktail bar in Amsterdam, it is what it is and booking means you get a seat, and you …"
25,Door 74, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place is something else. You have to know about it to find it. From the outside it doesn’t look more that a random door. When you ring the bell someone will guide you inside to such an amazing speakeasy. The staff is super passionate about making you a drink that will blow you away. Definitely coming back!
26,Door 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Our visit was more about the experience of being let into a hidden bar without any windows than the actual drinks. The drinks were good but not great and the prices were ok  (€13).
27,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good cocktails. Don’t ring the bell of the wrong door.
28,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really cool place.. absolutely fantastic atmosphere,  had a very good cocktail and pleasant conversation with the bartenders 🥂"
29,Door 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A cocktail bar tucked behind a secret Door - it’s quite hard to find or to get in but I guess that’s the concept.
Great vibe and a fantastic selection of very strong cocktails! Our waitress was …"
30,Door 74, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cocktail bar with soft music, cozy atmosphere, attentive staff. Cocktails are good, the gin and tonic special was wonderful, as was the ""special"" special cocktail that was put together on request. Service was incredibly personal, made sure …"
31,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great cocktails, and ambiance.  Although a little confusing getting in. It's not clear which is door 74, and I'm sure their neighbour's must get a lot of people ringing their bell. These are the high end cocktails you would expect to get at …"
32,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing experience!!! Loren was wonderful! Great cocktails.
33,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow! Is the right word for the quality of this spot. Very popular among tourists, this spot is worth the reputation, not to mention that we have tasted all the menu in two days in a row. I was with a cocktail specialist friend and he was …"
34,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you manage to find this place, then you're in for some really good drinks and an awesome atmosphere! Worth a visit!"
35,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best prohibition style cocktails bars in Amsterdam. Tricky to find but definitely worth it. Place was cozy, staff was really polite and friendly. Bartender Tim made absolutely amazing cocktails not from menu."
36,Door 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a nice concept, you have to have reservations and ring the bell to get into the bar. It's a small and cozy bar with nice music, at the perfect volume (unlike many other bars). The drinks are a bit pricey (13.5€) but the one I had with gin was good and refreshing. I still wish they had some more cocktails to choose from."
37,Door 74, 5 stars ,a year ago,A good location for a date or a cozy night out with girl friends. Cocktails are strong but you don't taste the alcohol at all. Amazing!
38,Door 74, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I really wanted to like this place - I appreciate a well-made cocktail with high-quality ingredients, and don’t mind paying for it. However, Door 74 disappointed in the taste of the cocktails. Despite very complex and rarified ingredients, …"
39,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great, friendly bartenders and inventive, delicious cocktails."
40,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, cool staff. Sit at the bar and chat up the bartender, you'll have a good time. …"
41,Door 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great hidden bar in the center of Amsterdam. We went there a few times already and the staff was very attentive to our needs and helpful. Some cocktails are a bit on the expensive side but they are also delicious. Note that if you decide …
42,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very out of the ordinary, the hot-dog infused cocktail is something to look forward to. Better reserve as there is little room and the bar works mostly on reservations, also know the street number as the name is nowhere to be seen when walking in the street."
43,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best cocktail bar in town. In a lovely place with lovely people
44,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love this place! The atmosphere is great, it's small and cosy and quiet even though it's a step away from the busiest parts of Amsterdam. The drinks are great and the people who work there are genuinely friendly and attentive."
45,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best cocktailbar in Amsterdam. Come here once a month to treat myself. Speak easy. Excellent drinks. Off the menu very open minded to help you out.  Expectations are every time met.
46,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing cocktails! Very good service.
The menu changes every 4 months so your experience whould be different. I tried the writter's breakfast and the later gator and they both were very tasty with deep layers. The best cocktails bar in Amsterdam!"
47,Door 74, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not exclusive like pretended.
Very dark ambiente and no suitable music.
The bartenders are arrogant, but cover it with a smile. …"
48,Door 74, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice secret bar, bookings are only done for the day, which is great, because that means its not booked up for months. If you leave a message in the morning they can usually accommodate you, if you show up unannounced you will likely …"
49,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic!  We could not have enjoyed ourselves more!  Drinks were unique, tasty with Dutch flare!  Staff were quirky, chatty and so friendly (even when they were busy).  Our bartender (who was also from Canada) was so creative in making us some special and personalized drinks.  Even the music was spot on!"
50,Door 74, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great service. The Cocktails are amazing. A bit expensive, but totally worth it. The entrance door is a bit hidden, so just look for a regular door."
51,Door 74, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best cocktail bars that just happen to stumble upon. No signage, just ring bell and you might get let in if there isn't a crowd already. Kevin, who worked the night I was there, is a master of cocktail craft, order the special cocktails from the menu or tell him what spirits you like and he'll make something for you."
52,Door 74, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Went to this bar with friends, the cocktails were amazing and we had a good time. When it came to paying we waited more than 20 minutes for someone to come and receive the payment after which I decided to go to the bar to pay. I was told …"
53,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place, amazing cocktails, very nice and attentive staff!"
54,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This place is so good - SO GOOD. I called around 3pm on a Monday to try and get reservations for four for later that evening and I left a message. Unfortunately I didn't hear back but we decided to show up anyway and they had already …
55,Door 74, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The most disappointing cocktail bar in any city for some time...

We dutifully booked a place to come to this ""exclusive"" bar. After waiting …"
56,Door 74, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The drinks were great. Faboulous menu and great atmosphere. The only thing seriously ruining our experience was that we ordered a table for 5 people and when a friend arrived with a friend they would not let them in, even though we did have …"
57,Door 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy bar with excellent atmosphere. The bartenders are friendly and looking to make a chat. Cocktails are good, but the menu could be improved to get 5 stars."
58,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely great people, atmosphere, cocktails and music! Must have for people who live in Amsterdam and for tourists"
59,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for cocktails. Nice concept of knocking on a secret door. If they let you in, grab a menu and get started! Nice atmosphere, a little dark but cool!"
60,Door 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing cocktails!! But not most atmospheric speakeasy. Still worth it if you like mixed drinks. Recommend a spicy margarita
61,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Both the decor and the cocktails at this place are great. Add to that the very friendly and chatty staff and you got yourself a a great evening. Prices are slightly higher than your average Amsterdam bar, but you pay for what you get. I'm definitely coming back to this place"
62,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is amazing! You should  to call and get your name added to the entry list and ask for directions if you need them. The bar entry is unmarked, just a plain door that looks residential. You have to ring the small doorbell and a …"
63,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great little place. You must have a reservation to get in, but it's really easy to do, just call the number on their website. A very cozy spot. Slightly limited ""menu"" of featured cocktails, but the knowledgeable bartenders will happily …"
64,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great selection of cocktails, brilliant service and cosy atmosphere. We mentioned that our drinks were a little sharp for our sweet taste and were offered new ones to our liking. Very good attention to detail  :)"
65,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent cocktails, prepare to be wowed. To get access you need to be on the guest list, to get on the guest list you need to call them, to find their number you need to search the World Wide Web. It seemed daunting at first but we …"
66,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved it! Super fun staff, great drinks, cool vibe. Definitely something to do to start or end your evening. If you come at 8pm it's pretty quiet. If you have never come to a speakeasy, than do this one!"
67,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent and serious cocktails, together with specialist beers and English cider from Herefordshire. The decor is subdued to encourage safe conversation, and the unmarked-door protocol reminds one of some of the semi-secret actors' bars in …"
68,Door 74, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The cocktails here are good. But the whole charade with the door costs them 2 stars: You as a potential guest have to ring the doorbell before they decide if they want to let you in... Even if you are allowed in by them, this insulting ritual doesn't make you feel very welcome."
69,Door 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Our groups first time going to a speak easy!

This was a very fun experience as we were trying to find the right ""door 74"", …"
70,Door 74, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Original cocktails for special occasions. If you're lucky to find the entrance door you'll enjoy a good atmosphere with appropriate level of music for conversations. Friendly staff and tasty cocktails come at the (really) upper end of the price range.
71,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Chic little bar, great ambience, fantastic cocktails and amazing service! Not crowded at all, booking is prefered since you need to be seated at a table. Super friendly place for a girls' night out. Definitely going back again and would recommend to anyone who prefers a more layback and chat-easy environment."
72,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Terrific place. Amazing cocktails and a great speakeasy vibe. Prices are a little on the high side (13-15 euros) but the drinks are well worth it.
Call ahead of you are coming in with a group on the same day. It gets tougher to …"
73,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Speakeasy with 20s music. Nice decor, excellent drinks.  The bar manager Kevin is a creative mixologist who really knows his spirits.  Thanks again!! We'll be back!!! Reservations are a must!!!!!!"
74,Door 74, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely concept! This is a “secret bar” with no signage, you have to ring the doorbell and someone will answer the door! To avoid disappointment text them earlier in the day and book in advance. Lovely atmosphere, friendly staff and cool selection of cocktails!"
75,Door 74, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super cool environment!! The atmosphere is perfect and the drinks are amazing. Has a great speak-easy feel. Look for the White doorbell
76,Door 74, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Drinks are amazing, both from the menu and off the menue. The closed bar thing, I don't get it, and it's nothing incredibly amazing inside, but staff is great and cocktails are equally so."
77,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best atmosphere and cocktails we'd had the pleasure of experiencing in Amsterdam. Shout out to Gavin, our new favourite Mixologist (aka Bar Tender). …"
78,Door 74, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best service I’ve had at any Bar in Amsterdam and truly amazing cocktails. Will definitely be back as soon as possible! Thank you to everyone at Door 74
79,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had an absolutely great time at Door 74.
It was quite hard to find it at first as the doors looks as if it's a normal block of flat entrance. We asked some locals and they directed us. When you ring …"
80,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great cocktails, reasonable prices. This place is hidden away, so look for the small sign on the door bell. On their website you can make a reservation by SMS, so you are sure to be seated."
81,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great atmosphere and drinks! It was a tight squeeze with a large group but overall a great speakeasy! I'd highly recommend getting a drink or 2 before a night out of dancing :)
82,Door 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,The waitress was flat out rude bar staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. At a certain point I asked the waitress if she could make me a drink instead she told me that I should just leave. I will not be coming back here and was expecting a …
83,Door 74, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Really cool cocktail bar with amazing cocktail recipes. Real speak-easy vibe. It gets a little hectic though and for the price of the cocktails i wish i could enjoy it more instead of having to dodge elbows!
84,Door 74, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A heaven of chic in a lousy street.
Here you will find an always impeccable service, a cocktail menu worthy of international level that changes every season and pristine ingredients. …"
85,Door 74, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"You've got to make a reservation at a phone number, never got called back so just went there and got in. Cocktails are well made but the menu is a bit far-fetched. Public on a saturday is loud and drunk which kind of ruins the atmosphere."
86,Door 74, 5 stars ,a year ago,One of my favorite places to visit and continue to return. Their drinks are ever changing and very well done. Service is great as well.
87,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"So much fun.

My cocktail came served in an actual horn. It still had some hairs attached. It …"
88,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Tim is a legend! His hospitality and friendliness were very genuine and he was a pleasure to chat with. We stayed and ordered more drinks than we planned to because of his amazing service.
89,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"unusual bar with no outer sign, a black door that looks like it would lead to a gay darkroom club and harsh Russian door control - but that's part of the fun! You really have to reserve, no other way in. The barkeepers experiment and create …"
90,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great atmosphhere. Lovely staff. Cocktails are the design by each person working there which adds a personal touch to the drinks. Very lively and upbeat place. Reservations are advised

92,Door 74, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic cocktail bar, that differs from all the tourist traps,  although being in in the city of Amsterdam. Of course, the drinks are a little expensive, but it is a nice escape from the crowded streets. It is advised to make a reservation."
93,Door 74, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Dissapointed ! Place is small ,it was not like our expectation . Staffs are arrogant,and rude,fake smiles !  . Terrible services ( if they don't like the customer, they might gossiping the customer right to your ears ! LoL ) …"

97,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One amazing experience, from a very ordinary to exquisitely timed wonderful journey of service and for the love of the ambience.

99,Door 74, 1 star ,4 years ago,This bar is apparently built around the notion of being arrogant towards the most friendly of the visitors. My recommendation to anyone interested is to get ready for some humiliating negotiation at the doorstep. At the end you will most …
100,Door 74, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"One of the best in Amsterdam
But unfortunately they closed their doors  :(
Edit: rumour has it, it’s only temporarily 😍"
101,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff are very well informed and know what they’re doing. I really like this place. It’s expensive but it’s meant to be, and the quality of drinks is very good. Worth a visit!"
102,Door 74, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The menu is small, you can choose between 6 different drinks which for me were a) too small for the price (about €13) and b) too strong to enjoy.
The atmosphere was chill, mainly people +35."

104,Door 74, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"came here with 2 friends, had a place with too much lighting, the cocktails were made on request and no menu. due to a dissaronno night orsomething. orders did not came correct (too sour or anything) and a big noisy group of people. no relax atmosphere. I would recommend cocktailbar Njoy near leidseplein. much better."
105,Door 74, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"It’s just like any other Amsterdam  trashy tourist bar. The inside looks cheap and stuffy with loud music, loud people ( only tourists ), menu is printed on a map paper. Cocktails (13.5€) are ok but nothing special. …"
106,Door 74, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"beautifull place, really good cocktails. just a waste it had a bachelorparty that night. which kinda ruined it for the rest of the company. The manager offered us a free drink for the inconvieniance which was kind!"

108,Door 74, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very good cocktail bar which also serve great virgin cocktails. Interesting mix of flavours which just works out ectremely well. Very friendly and easy going staff.
109,Door 74, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"That was an amazing experience! First of all you need to find a way to get to the bar, but after that would be done, you will enter a bohemian bar, with excellent service, outstanding menu and very delicious drinks. Be aware that regular drink price is around 16 euro"
110,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Prohibition era atmosphère. If you found the 74, ring the bell and open your eyes. The two staff are really awesome. Enjoy"
111,Door 74, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"If you go, make sure to sit on the bar or the service you get will suffer.
It's a neat place with a nice vibe, cocktails were great, though they forgot our order twice."
112,Door 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst service ever! 20 minutes waiting to be served and ended up leaving without being served at all. No patience to see the bartenders chit chatting with American customers so loudly which is not expected in a speak easy (even in their …

122,Door 74, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Bad ambience, terrible drinks, ridiculously overpriced. Nothing speakeasy about it. Drinks that should be €3 costing €15! It's just a standard cheap bar that actually charges more. Give it a miss. Conclusion: 0 out of 5."

136,Door 74, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Sara is one of the best bartenders in Amsterdam. Ask her some tiki  cocktail or anything whit Sour !! And you'll be delighted🥃🥃🥃
137,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great cocktails and staff. Worth the steps to figure out how to get in. A must visit place when your in town.
138,Door 74, 1 star ,3 years ago,Asked the bartender if we could come in and we were told he would let us know in a minute.15 minutes past and still no answer. Called the bar and the lady said she would come down and open the door  but 10mi s later she still didn't show up. Really bad service and we didn't even get through the door.
139,Door 74, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent cocktails. The staff are friendly and it has a nice atmosphere

148,Door 74, 1 star ,4 years ago,"They use the same straw over and over to taste the cocktials, and just dip it into a sink of water as their attempt to ""clean"" it. Expect to wake up with a sore throat after visiting this place."
149,Door 74, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"One of best cocktail bars I have been to, visited a few times now. Very very good!"
150,Door 74, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Original cocktails for special occasions. If you're lucky to find the entrance door you'll enjoy a good atmosphere with appropriate level of music for conversations. Friendly staff and tasty cocktails come at the (really) upper end of the price range.

159,Door 74, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"You've got to make a reservation at a phone number, never got called back so just went there and got in. Cocktails are well made but the menu is a bit far-fetched. Public on a saturday is loud and drunk which kind of ruins the atmosphere."
