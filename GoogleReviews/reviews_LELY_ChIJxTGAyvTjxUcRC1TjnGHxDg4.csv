0,LELY, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"One of the best restaurant in Amsterdam west. The food is great, high quality standard. I can definitely recommend it."
1,LELY, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"A great place to meet up with friends for drinks and snacks, just next to Lelylaan station. Great menu with lots of beers, cocktails, and tasty bites! They have a spacious covered terrace as well as extra seating for warmer, sunnier days."
2,LELY, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Super friendly staff, not very elaborate but very tasteful menu. The dishes are original, somewhat fancy variations on popular foods. Portions not too big, but just right for most (big eaters will want both a starter and a side dish). Friendly, homey atmosphere"
3,LELY, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The burgers arrived fast and very extremely tasty! The fries was also of good quality.
Friendly, smiling staff!
Nice interior, big selection of beers."

5,LELY, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Had lunch here with 7 people after my wedding. Nice and casual place. The staff / kitchen struggled a bit to give all orders at once, but service was good anyway. Breakfast menu: great, food: okay/good, staff: friendly and relaxed."

9,LELY, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have been to bar lely three times for coffee, cakes, and beers. I love their spacious and chic interior, the food and drinks are all really nice, and the staff are all very kind. Prices are average but quality is a bit better than other cafes in my view!"
10,LELY, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is excellent but needs to get some better. For example, the menu must have been more clear, free wi-fi to the customers and more dedication and attention to the customers. However, the food is excellent and the place as well. Nice to chill with friends or some partner"
11,LELY, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Can not recommend this place enough, it‚Äôs always my first stop before the airport and my last stop before I leave Amsterdam again. They have a heated outside area, amazingly friendly staff and a diverse menu of food and drinks."

32,LELY, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love the atmosphere and the staff have always been wonderful. The place has contributed to the most incredible conversations I've ever had the chance of having.

33,LELY, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice place! Big outside area where you can sit and have a beer and snacks. The food was really good and fresh. I had a rib-eye steak which was really nice. You can taste and know that everything is cooked on demand and no re-heating ‚Ä¶

37,LELY, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Completely surpassed all expectations! The menu is small and doesn't look like much. We ordered a cheeseburger with fries. It was absolutely amazing! The patty was large, fresh, and tasty, the brioche bun nice and soft, the fries also amazing (just the right amount, too) and the sauce amazing. Loved every bite!"
38,LELY, 1 star ,8 months ago,It tasted really bad. What a wasted of my time and money. Kimchi cheese sandwich is the worst combination. The take out package is not environmentally friendly.
39,LELY, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great food! This place is a great place to go if you just came from some place far using the train just in time for a meal. I really liked my burger and fries. Waiters were very nice. It's also very easy to find because it's in a very open area by the train station.

52,LELY, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The beautiful thing about the Netherlands is that not all great venues are within the centre of the cities. LELY is located conveniently near the IND and Lelylaan station. The staff are very warm and relaxed, the coffee is great, with ample beers on tap. An outer city diamond worth travelling to."
53,LELY, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Be careful, criminals are also visiting this restaurant and before you know it your bag is gone. Staff is not paying any attention to who is visiting their venue. ‚Ä¶"
