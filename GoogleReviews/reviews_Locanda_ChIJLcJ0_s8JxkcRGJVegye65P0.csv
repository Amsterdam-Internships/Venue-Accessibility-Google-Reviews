0,Locanda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty italian cuisine. Best pizza I've ever had. Everyo made from scratch and nice wines. Cozy place and nice staff. Good pricing, me and my friends are students but could still afford a nice dinner."
1,Locanda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tiny little Italian gem of a little restaurant with a modern but cozy atmosphere, and incredibly affordable pricing.  Feels like a ""neighborhood"" place, but with such creativity, quality, and precise execution, it's worth making your way …"
2,Locanda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I am Italian and I can say the pizza here is really worth it! The ingredients are all Italian and they are all fresh and delicious. Pizza was as crunchy as the Italian one and the ham on it comes from a little place in Italy, so it’s not usual also to find that ham in my country. Tourists and locals should try!"
3,Locanda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful food and service for a reasonable price. Each dish we got was €14-€16. They served complimentary bread with lemon butter that was made in house. The food did not take long to make and was clearly fresh. Free WiFi, clean bathroom for customers. I would 100% recommend this place!"
4,Locanda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Small Italian place with dedicated staff. Dishes are tasteful and prepared in the basement kitchen. …
5,Locanda, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Took a while for the food to arrive. Tables were very close one to another. Lasagna is apparently the popular dish but there is no tomato sauce and I was still hungry after eating it.
6,Locanda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had a great meal here on Tuesday. The starter with the cured pork and fried bread was incredible. Not sure what made the mozzarella so creamy but it all great. …
7,Locanda, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The place has potential, if they get more experienced staff (kitchen + waiters) or train current one. Despite making a reservation, our table was not ready. They sent us to a different, smaller table for the first 10 min, but that one was …"
8,Locanda, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really nice and friendly service. The food was good, but not more than normal and i was soo disapointed because the price was way to high for everage food. The pictures where from the last year (i was also there). As Dessert we got a …"
9,Locanda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely great Italian food. Good wine selection, very friendly staff and a dessert that was to die for. Had an great time there and would definitely recommend a visit if you like fine Italian cuisine. (don't expect a casual pizzeria)"
10,Locanda, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a nice evening, the staff is very friendly and the food was good....

11,Locanda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best restaurant we visited while on our holiday in Amsterdam! Lovely staff with great service and the food is fantastic! I can highly recommend the lasagne and the tiramasu is a knockout! Prices are also very reasonable given the location, next time we're in the city it'll be our first port of call!"

17,Locanda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"What a great find in the Jordaan. Super cute Italian restaurant with a great menu. Delicious food, good wine and very reasonable prices. I had the tortelli and it was great, and the starters were top too. I’ll be back!"
