0,Coffeeshop Blue Sea, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Chill vibe at the coffeeshop, very polite owner"
1,Coffeeshop Blue Sea, 1 star ,3 months ago,"The grass was good. It's okay to take away, but it's not recommended as coffee. Especially the aquarium is more cruelty to animals than pleasant. The aquarium is completely dirty and the animals look depressed. If I hadn't been too tired, I would have liked to have addressed it. The art on the wall is fascinating."

11,Coffeeshop Blue Sea, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Blue sea was the first coffee shop me and my boyfriend came into after landing in Amsterdam.   There was a lovely selection of choice but ultimately I persuaded my boyfriend to go with agent orange. One of my favourites by far. Lovely ‚Ä¶

13,Coffeeshop Blue Sea, 1 star ,3 years ago,The place is absolutely the worst. The owner is aggressive to say the least - he kicked out one of the customers who was quietly enjoying his time and even purchased food from the shop. Needless to say this is not the atmosphere any self ‚Ä¶
