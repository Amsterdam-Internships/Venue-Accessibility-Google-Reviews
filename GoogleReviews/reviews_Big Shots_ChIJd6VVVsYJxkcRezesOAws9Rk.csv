0,Big Shots, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"My favourite spot in Amsterdam. The food is unbelievable with a big variety of food, alongside an amazing atmosphere. I first visited 6 months ago and now am a frequent regular when I visit the country. Perfect for smokers and drinkers ‚Ä¶"
1,Big Shots, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice ambiance inside. plenty of screens to watch sports and able to smoke inside without tabccoüôè just out the center so quieter than those bars on the inside. Plenty of spirits behind the bar too and have a good few tables inside to drink ‚Ä¶
2,Big Shots, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Exceptional service.
U can smoke (not buy) in and out of the restaurent.
Staff super friendly"

And the best biscuits ever ^_^"
5,Big Shots, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"It's not the type of place you go on purpose (at least I hope not, you're in Amsterdam go try something out of your comfort zone!) But if you're super drunk and in an emergency hungry situation, then eh why not, it tasted fine enough I think"

14,Big Shots, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Was a bit surprised after reading the reviews about this place i was expecting to enjoy it. However, the place was filthy and beer was flat you could tell the pipes were not clean and the whole place needs some more love and affection.

Warm blankets and hot drinks, could not ask for more :)"

18,Big Shots, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Staff personal tried to rob me twice in the same sale. I ordered 2 teas, in the menu marked as 3,5‚Ç¨. I paid with 10‚Ç¨, didnt receive my change and had to argue about it. After I receive my change and the ticket said 4‚Ç¨/each. Complaint about this and they say that menu is old. Tired of tourist schemes"
19,Big Shots, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Typical decent bar sports bar with great selection of beers and   food. You do however have to pay a tax on each total of alcohol you buy, so buy in bulk. For example, 2 separate rounds of drinks will incur the 8% alcohol tax. Also, there are 2 bars with the same name! Impossible when trying to find half cut üòâ"
