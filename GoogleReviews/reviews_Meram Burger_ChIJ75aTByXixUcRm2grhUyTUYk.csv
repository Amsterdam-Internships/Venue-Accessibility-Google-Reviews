Extra star for their friendliness...
Shisha was good... Fries were really tasty... …"
1,Meram Burger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Had the most unfriendly and grumpy lady behind the counter ever. She didn't bother to articulate and wasn't at all helpful. Fries are good, but the food is so-so. The falafel burger is literally a bun with falafel balls in it - not a patty. Not really sure why they don't include sauce with the menu."
2,Meram Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best food in Amster for Russian people I think. And it not expansive! Highly recommended
3,Meram Burger, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Wauw, I never ate such disgusting food...... It is just a disgrace to the turkish cuisine. The meat hadn't any flavor the adana, kofte and chicken breast tasted more like left overs from the dark ages."

7,Meram Burger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Big homemade burger with crunchy wedge fries. Tasty not like the factory made burger. Bit pricey, but foodwise it’s fine. Quality always comes with a price plus it’s quite a trendy interior. Nice for family and young people to hang out"

11,Meram Burger, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Went twice now. It is one of the few places in the area still open around midnight.Very nice interior. Twister fries are good. The burgers are just sad, especialy for that price. Dry, overbaked, tasteless. I am surprised it is still quite busy when I pass by."
12,Meram Burger, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Harissa burger and curly fries were AWESOME. Loved the presentation of the food. However the falafal burger was easily the worst I've ever seen in my life :'''( Do not take your vegetarian friends here, they will be very sad!"
