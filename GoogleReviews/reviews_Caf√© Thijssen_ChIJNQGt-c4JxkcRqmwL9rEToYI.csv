0,Caf√© Thijssen, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Even though the ambiance is nice, the service is terrible. I was waiting 40 minutes for my beer and never got the food I ordered. I checked with the staff twice if it was still coming and with the third time checking the kitchen was closed. …"
1,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great ambiance to go with friends for a beer and have some krocketten
The sunset feels magical"
2,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Enjoyed a wonderful breakfast and apple pie!
3,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great hot spot happen to stumble upon looking for a quick drink and tosti! They were out of tostis, but able to get another Dutch inspired app which was yummy.  Great patio and also nice interior as well!  Friendly service! 🍷"
4,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,6 months ago,One of these cafés you just love in Amsterdam. Good laid back quick service and of course a good apple pie. Sitting on the terrace when weather permits. Good place to start the day ...
5,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love this place for a late lunch. Am a regular when in town. Its a slow place so don't expect them to attend to you the moment you sit down. This is an hour long sandwich / lunch. Take it easy and enjoy the food and atmosphere. Recommend the smoked mackerel sandwich on brown with a beer. Perfect!
6,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a good place to have lunch, dinner and late night drinks. They have a terrace in the middle of the street and on the sidewalk.  It's a rare occasion of a downtown Amsterdam bar, yet it's not too touristy. Go for the Spanish plate, …"
7,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Soup! This place does soup like a boss! Very relaxing, great service... But can be pretty crowded... But worth the wait.. Get a beer, hang out. The pastries and cakes are worthy of a great afternoon snack - especially if you have been out hiking about. If you are lucky, you can catch the farmers market on Saturdays."
8,Caf√© Thijssen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Waited a while to get attended. I ordered something to the waitress and she said she couldn't find it on her smartphone order app and completely ignored me. So I ended up ordering something a sandwich that was really small. My wife ordered …
9,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had such a good time at Café Thijssen. The food was excellent, especially the bread which was so fresh and delicious.

10,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delightful cafe with good beer, coffee and food. A beautiful spot in a quiet area by the canals. Very reasonable prices, toasted sandwiches from about €3. Highly recommended."

15,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious finger food, charming inside decoration, crew who remained pleasant and efficient through and through despite the number of tables they had to serve !, nice setting (close to the canal and their outdoor tables face a little …"
16,Caf√© Thijssen, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very disappointing Club Sandwich, besides the little quantity there were not even all the ingredients announced in the menu. € 7.50😳 😤🤐"
17,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I like this bar, especially indoors. Decent pub food, good selection of beers, reasonably priced"
18,Caf√© Thijssen, 1 star ,4 months ago,Very rude owner.. I was sitting outside. He did not allow me to go inside to the toilet because I chose not to take a specific treatment in my body
19,Caf√© Thijssen, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Orderded Pita Vega stoof was not complete with coleslaw and after asking was charged fully, she said she would organize it, then when asking the specific details of the bill was still charged fully.. Asked why.. than manager came and gave back the money. So watch out....."
20,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This must be my favorite place to brunch in the Jordaan. The falafel was damn tasty!

25,Caf√© Thijssen, 1 star ,2 years ago,Nice staff but incredibly slow service. We sat at one of their outdoor tables and waited for 40 mins to get served. We even had to call over the waitress. She was lovely but the wait was unacceptable. We almost left without paying because …
26,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great snacks and very nice atmosphere. They have a wide menu of beers also 🍻
27,Caf√© Thijssen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably waited around 40 minutes for our food to be served, which was just a ham and cheese toastie. However, the day we went there was very busy so I can understand the delay. There is a nice view of the river. There were many tourists …"
28,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Typically Dutch Brown Cafe. The local equivalent to the American greasy spoon diner. Ain't nothing or wrong or particularly remarkable about it, but hey that in itself is the charm."
29,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food, price correct!
Recommended"
30,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely love coming here whenever we visit Amsterdam. Great atmosphere and beer. Food is also good.
31,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"You have to try the vegetarian bitterballen! Especially the coconut curry! This place is always packed bc the food is lekker, the staff is excellent, and the views are perfect. I like the atmosphere as well. Get ready for a wait, this place always has a full house."
32,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great place... Amazing croquettes and nice service. Apple pie is also very good.
33,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful place for a Sunday brunch! Located in a beautiful, lively, and central area, it offers a variety of food (some vegan too!) of great quality, and when the weather permits, one can sit on tables outside in the sun. Sometimes, nevertheless, when one sits inside, it can get very loud from conversations. Recommended!"
34,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really beautiful location and a very relaxing vibe, they have an excellent beer selection & friendly staff. Decent toasties although small, are very reasonably priced. My wife had a delightful Spanish Plate which really was enough for two."

36,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Lovely seating outside in a very calm neighbourhood.

Loved their olive tapenade that came with the bread. Also ordered the young …"
37,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely space to sit and have a warm drink and some apple pie. Extremely busy on market day but great for people watching! In the winter it’s a cosy place to visit and play some of the available games with friends and family.
38,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such an amazing place! Tried bitterbollen and loved it. Cosy, in a very beautiful area. Friendly waiters and the atmosphere is simply wonderful. We came here after Van Gogh museum and enjoyed discussing here our impressions so much! Recommended!"
39,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice local busy cafe.  We went back twice in the same day!  Had a yummy cheese and tomato toastie and some deliciously different veggie bitterballs with a nice spicy sauce.  Of course they have several good local biers to choose from on tap.  We tried several.  :) We will probably go back tomorrow!
40,Caf√© Thijssen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Lived right across this and had a view of the crowd here every night. Finally decided to try their food here one night. Their apple pie wasn’t the best (go to Winkel for that), but their bitterballen and drinks are pretty decent. Good for drinking but spend your dinner elsewhere."
41,Caf√© Thijssen, 3 stars ,5 years ago,I like this place during the day or early evening. Massive scene on a Friday night ... and perhaps I've reached the point in my life where I'd rather not be jostled repeatedly to order a glass of wine. But it's a classic Dutch bar. Enjoyable - I just generally prefer something a little quieter.
42,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great fun place, with open sky square in the middle of the street. Good service, staff service was excellent,  served with a smile each time and also very enjoyable as staff is very friendly. …"
43,Caf√© Thijssen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, sure, big terrace at the sun and lot of tables inside. BUT : the service is a mess. They don t for which are the orders. All the waiters does same table.  Sure it s saturday 11.40am and busy. We took the menu by ourselves. We …"
44,Caf√© Thijssen, 1 star ,2 years ago,Messed up 2/5 orders. Then brought 2 lunches out straight away. Then waited 20 to 30 minutes for the other two. Then they brought me the wrong lunch so I had to wait again. And they brought out an alcoholic drink instead of the non …
45,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In the Jordaan this delightful cafe is charming on the inside and has seating in a park like area shaded by trees.  The food was fresh and tasty, the service fast and friendly, and the prices were much less than in the heart of the old city."
46,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great place for stopping by for a quick coffee in the weekend or a place for a drink at night with your friends. Always busy and full of energy. Could be a bit hectic ordering a drink though. Also they have these small stools that are not always as comfortable.
47,Caf√© Thijssen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Eh. Unfortunately “toastie” here means “cheap, thin sandwich on white bread.” (They apparently offer brown bread but our waiter didn’t mention it.) The apple pie was okay. Unless you’re desperate to sit down, walk right on past."
48,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Generally they serve good quality stuff, but the number of staffs are not enough most of the time which can make you waiting for someone to come and take your order more than 15 minuts. There are plenty seat outside which gives you the …"
49,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A really handy shop if you stay in the north west part of the city centre. The staff are helpful and friendly, there's always people in the cafe but there's normally space to sit and chill. They sell a good selection here and also seeds, good prices too."
50,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good service, the place is nice and has a good vibe with excellent choice of music. Was looking for a bar where I can sit a bit longer and charge my phone. …"
51,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We stayed directly across the street from this lovely Cafe and had a number of delicious meals there.  We especially enjoyed their breakfast and apple pie.  Has a great authentic feel to it.
52,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"There is always people around this place, which makes it an ideal spot to date or catch-up one on one. Now admitted, you'll have to go to the bar yourself if you want drinks as two people just can't serve everyone, but that's atmosphere coming at a price."
53,Caf√© Thijssen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A well known place in Amsterdam, Café Thijssen is located in one of the few still partly quiet corners of the city center. And that says something as the crowd two streets further is beyond crazy. Thijssen because of that gets visited by …"
54,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice bar,went for a birthday party/works drinks. Was busy but not a bad choice if you're in the area."
55,Caf√© Thijssen, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Beer is good as it comes from a bottle but the nachos they dare to sell you for 8 euro's are embarrassing.  Sticky, soggy and obviously old. Not happy at all."

57,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Good place for some beers or cocktails
58,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It's friendly but very overcrowded on Saturdays owing to the mixed Market that is on its footsteps on Saturdays - ordered drinks with one of the stallholders and got it quickly - maybe cos he's a regular
59,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Our absolute favorite place for drinks and appetizers in Amsterdam. This area feels less touristy and all the staff and patrons were really friendly. Sit outside and watch the people bike by!

Friendly waiters and nice music :)
I visited on a rainy afternoon and it was perfect to chill and talk"

62,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The service was good and the food also. The place was a bit crowded but we managed to find a table. The soups were delicious and the club sandwich I've had was good. The portions are quite big.
63,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One cortado (and some snacks if hungry) is all you need. Superb place - great vibe and very lively, including the hostess."
64,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the better places to breakfast - good outside seating, cool place with cool music, nice views and well priced menu, the brown bread Croque Madame with an egg was especially good, the orange is fresh and the coffee fresher."

69,Caf√© Thijssen, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Good food but horrible service.
70,Caf√© Thijssen, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Get ready to wait forever, it took us 40 mins to order and then we got pita falafel without the falafel. 1 star cause the apple pie was good."
71,Caf√© Thijssen, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good cappuccino.
But when  I came  with my mother especially (!!!)  In the evning,  they told us that the coffee  musine is close.  For some of us that don't want to drink alcohol ,  it was very disappointning and unpleasant.  Why force  people  to drink alcohol???"
72,Caf√© Thijssen, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Monday pubquiz in English/ Dutch starts at 8pm. Good selection of drinks, typical brown café. Only con was having staff running behind my back and pushing me around due to poor planning of space."

74,Caf√© Thijssen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great ambience friendly and warm 😃
