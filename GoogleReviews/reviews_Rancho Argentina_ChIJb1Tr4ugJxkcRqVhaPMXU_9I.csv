0,Rancho Argentina, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The 9.95 euro lunch special for 2 people was 28 USD out the door. I would not recommend as there are many other options in this street. The chicken was very bland and no flavor with frys and a salad.
1,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Lovely staff and cheap lunch set at ‚Ç¨9.95 (excluding drinks). Washroom on the 3rd floor and steep stairs. Haha
2,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We got there early because we had been in the city since 6 am. They have a special until 6 pm, so we got steak with a drink, a salad and fries for 10‚Ç¨. The steak was really good, one of the better ones I've had and especially at that price. ‚Ä¶"
3,Rancho Argentina, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Do not recommend! Service was horrible and the seats were really uncomfortable. It took forever (easily an hour after ordering, and 45 minutes between courses) for the food to arrive and the quality was very poor. My salmon was completely ‚Ä¶"
4,Rancho Argentina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The worst steak house.  Unprofessional chef, the steak was rubbery as he burnt the fat on the outside and the inside was left bloody rare. ‚Ä¶"
5,Rancho Argentina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst steak ever. Better eating a Nike shoe. I have plenty experience with Argentinian meat and steaks. You should invest a lot of ""ingenuity"" to destroy an entrec√¥te steak. They made it. Totally  inedible. I left it after one bite. ‚Ä¶"
6,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing food we have ordered here.
7,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is very cosy. Service was technically exellent and the waiter was also very friendly, polite! We were sattiufed with the courses we've got. My beefburger was really nice,  fries - crispy and the side salad was tasty and fresh.  Thank you!"
8,Rancho Argentina, 1 star ,4 years ago,Food was very sub-standard and what you would expect from a typical tourist trap. The burger for close to 15‚Ç¨ would even be considered an offence being sold for 5‚Ç¨. ‚Ä¶
9,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food and service. The menu is a mix of Argentinean, Mexican and Italian dishes and you can pick and choose what you want. Staff were very friendly and prices were reasonable."
10,Rancho Argentina, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This restaurant was a surprise. I went to use my 50% sale. I used I Amsterdam card  and I paid 20 ‚Ç¨ but I ate a lot: gulasch soup , salad , a steak,  bread , beer , baked potatoes...."
11,Rancho Argentina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"For your information, firstly, you can not use the discount offers of the Iamsterdam city card if you order those  ‚Äúmenus below 15 euros‚Äù, secondly, don‚Äôt hold your expectations high about that ‚Äùausentic grill‚Äù of theirs since it‚Äôs a meal ‚Ä¶"
12,Rancho Argentina, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food and excellent service. Medium priced and certainley not as expensive as I expected. The Argentinian steak is a must have, and the draught Heineken is brilliant."

14,Rancho Argentina, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The steak is so so good, we will go back again.  The staff very friendly.  I can only recommend it, it is worthwhile going there."
15,Rancho Argentina, 1 star ,4 years ago,I told them no lactose in my meal and they served me carpaccio with cheese! I had one bite unwittingly and thry took barely any resposibility. They offered me the water on the house. I guess thats what poisining me is worth. Avoid!
