46,Café Luxembourg, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We were here for a quick bite and a hot drink to escape the rainy weather outside. The place was packed so we could only find a place to sit at the massive centre table that seats about 8-10 people. We loved the decor and the ambience of …

50,Café Luxembourg, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Arguably one of my favorite places in Amsterdam for breakfast and lunch. It's a very old cafe style place that feels very authentic. Most waiters have been working there for as long as I can remember and are extremely service minded.
51,Café Luxembourg, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice setting but the food is awful here. The worst/toughest steak I’ve ever had. Undercooked fries. Well done, salty burger with a hard as a rock stale bun. Interior setting is nice, but go somewhere else."

59,Café Luxembourg, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good atmosphere, friendly staff, solid food. Get your butt over there if you're in the center. The entrance is on the side during the winter, near the giant menu they have outside."
60,Café Luxembourg, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Has gone downhill rapidly. Personell acts almost inconvenienced by your mere presence, very unfriendly and seem unwilling to even take an order. Coffee was cold when we got it, went somewhere else for lunch."
61,Café Luxembourg, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I love this place.  I always visit on the 2 to 3 visits I make to Amsterdam a year.  They have a conservatory type structure on the front and it's great eating and drinking and watching all that is going on outside.  They do a really nice …

67,Café Luxembourg, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"They supposed to have the best bitterballen in Amsterdam. After spending 6.50 euro on 6 bitterballen, I can conclude that it is totally overrated and would never come here for that again. Their sandwiches are pretty decent though."
