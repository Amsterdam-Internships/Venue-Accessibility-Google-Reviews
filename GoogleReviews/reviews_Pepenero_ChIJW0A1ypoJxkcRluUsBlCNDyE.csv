1,Pepenero, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Such a pleasure to go back to one of your favorite restaurants and enjoy great Italian food. Marco and his team make you feel welcome. Pepe Nero is always a good choice in a nice and not too crowded setting
2,Pepenero, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"My fav Italian in town. Whatever one gets from the menu is delicious. But do try the melanzane, the spaghetti pomodori in a cheese wheel and the sgroppino made on the spot. Fabulous!"
3,Pepenero, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Really good food and service!
Highly recommended"
4,Pepenero, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food!!! One of our favorite restaurants. You need the make a reservation on time, but it is definitely worth it. Friendly staff too."
5,Pepenero, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Such a great Italian place. Everything feels homemade and the service is great. The truffle pasta is heaven on a plate!
6,Pepenero, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food in general is not bad yet was not exceeding expectation which was high. There was too much oil on octopus carpaccio. Black pasta was good tho.

14,Pepenero, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I organized a dinner here and it was really wonderful!

22,Pepenero, 1 star ,5 years ago,Can't say much about the food. They took 30min to bring us a menu while there was one waiter passing in front of our table every 30s. Expect long waits for anything. So in the end we took our coats and went to casa nostra which was much nicer and better.
23,Pepenero, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent Italian restaurant with very friendly staff

30,Pepenero, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice ambience, tasty food. Tomatoe soup was excellent, truffle spaghetti with too much oil on my taste."
31,Pepenero, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Hesitant to tell the world about this gem... it's already hard enough to get a table. The antipasti are outstanding and the main courses keep up with them. Don't tell anyone...
