1,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Can't believe my bf took me to this place just today. He should've introduced me to here earlier!ü§£ The food is superb üòç. The curry noodle with crispy pork on top was amazing. Tom Yum was also great (as a hangover cure). If we weren't ‚Ä¶

3,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great vegetarian and vegan options. Drinks are amazing and the staff are very friendly. Must try their Thai Basil fried rice.
4,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,7 months ago,They offer beautiful outdoor seating with umbrellas. We did have to wait half an hour for a table outside on a Thursday around 6 pm. Staff was friendly and took our orders promptly. The food was tasty but I did find my seafood dish a bit ‚Ä¶
5,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Sizable portions and quality food. The Tom yum soup was great as lunch during a cold day. The I was most impressed by the Noodle to meat to broth ratio. Only gripe is that the water tasted horrible. Asked for one with and without ice, and the one with ice tasted like chemicals."
6,Sugar & Spice, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Food is great, but water tastes funky. So does the ginger ale. The fried coconut ice cream tastes like French fries and ice cream and honey mixed together. NOT GOOD COMBO. Overall food is 8/10, employees are 11/10 (very respectful), but the ‚Ä¶"

8,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Went here with my boyfriend for dinner. We shared the Crispy Giant Squid, Chicken Satay, and Chicken on Fire. I had the Kanom Jean Namya curry. The appetizers were great, but the curry was bland, watery and seemed to made with angel hair ‚Ä¶"
9,Sugar & Spice, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"If you are Asian, I don‚Äôt recommend this restaurant. If you are American, I recommend this restaurant.
Personally I don‚Äôt like the mango curry. ‚Ä¶"
10,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing selection of Thai food! Great service- so quick from ordering to eating! And their online waitlist is awesome to know when to show up.
11,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"First time at this place , very conveniently located right next to porter square, so easy to get here via train. Also if you have car, you could park near the star market/Michaels that has a lot of parking spaces. We got in queue through ‚Ä¶"
12,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Cute spot and has an amazing variety of food. The menu is divided into regions of Thailand which makes it even more amazing. Definitely try their frozen drinks. Totally worth it. Recommend Pi√±a Colada drink.  The creamy Tomyum soup would ‚Ä¶

15,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,8 months ago,It is pretty authentic Thai place. Good variety of street noodles and rice dishes. The spice level is pretty good. ‚Ä¶
16,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Sugar & Spice Thai is one of my favourite restaurants to come and eat! I‚Äôve come multiple times here and I can never get enough of their food, I‚Äôm bias because I love Thai food. They never disappoint with their crispy giant squid, hence why ‚Ä¶"
17,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"By far, one of the best, authentic Thai restaurant in Boston. Must tries are Sai Ua (Northern Style Sausages) and Som Tum Plara. (Pickled Blue Crab) . The staff are super friendly and attentive. The food came in an orderly manner with well presented plates. Highly recommend this restaurant."
18,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a month ago,Fantastic Thai food with a menu that goes far beyond your classic Thai dishes. Recommend trying their specialty drinks and the kana moo krob
19,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a month ago,I got entirely vegan pad thai with fried tofu and it was delicious!
20,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"To go place for the best thai food. The dishes were not only delicious but also looked so pretty. I loved the massaman curry !!
They have outdoor sitting which needs to be reserved in advance. Also, there are a few street parking spots which get filled quick."
21,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Sugar & Spice is an all time favorite restaurant for me. They have a huge menu with a variety of options for everyone's taste. They also have spice levels mentioned against each dish they offer. For me, I get the perfect range of flavors and spice here. I have been to this place multiple times and have loved almost everything I tried."
22,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,One of the best Thai places I‚Äôve ever been to. Did outdoor dining there last year and the food was delicious and service was friendly and helpful! ‚Ä¶
23,Sugar & Spice, 1 star ,2 months ago,I have been here two times. Both times there has been a serious problem in one way or another. ‚Ä¶
24,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,"I would really like to give this restaurant the benefit of the doubt, but I can‚Äôt risk eating here again. I ordered delivery of crab rangoons and ‚Äúvery spicy‚Äù thai basil fried rice, and spent the night awake being ill. What little filling ‚Ä¶"
25,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Generous portion for the price and beautiful presentation.
26,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Extensive vegan menu, extremely delicious and spiced Thai cuisine. The Simply Sunrise pancake is amazingly crisp, and the Tofu Sukiyaki is a great glass noodle dish with deep spices. ‚Ä¶"
27,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"One of the few Thai restaurants in Boston that even tries to get it right. This is my go-to spot for reliving the high of trying khao soi in northern Thailand for the first time. Even the appetizers, the beef satay has no business being as good as it is. This is it!"
28,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Sugar and Spice always delivers on AMAZING flavors and unique menu items. Simply the best Thai to visit or enjoy at home.
29,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"What isn‚Äôt there to love about Sugar & Spice?! The food is absolutely delicious, the staff and service goes above and beyond, and they have indoor and outdoor seating! Boat noodle soup, fresh rolls, chicken basil fried rice, and mango ‚Ä¶"
30,Sugar & Spice, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Ordered the chicken bulgogi lunch box. Rice and noodles were cold, undercooked and lacked flavor. Iced Thai milk tea was delicious though. Would recommend seating outdoors because it felt they forgot the patrons that were seated inside"
31,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"This place is always a disaster, waited an hour for indoor seating and they stood us to the side when it was ready. They forgot about us and gave the table to someone else, then said we had to wait another 40 min. ‚Ä¶"
32,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good Thai food. Some dishes are extra spicy just the way they should be. So if you see 3 Chili's, be warned. No joke. Curry's are super tatsy. This might be our new Thai spot. Certainly are coming back to try more delectable and spicy food. Nice and friendly staff adds to the experience. They also have a nice outdoor seating area."
33,Sugar & Spice, 1 star ,3 months ago,I was shocked when this restaurant could change customers order without calling customers they are running out of the flat noodles. I ordered on uber eats and what to try the drunken noodle because the dishes are highlighted as recommended. ‚Ä¶
34,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,6 months ago,BEST ICED THAI TEA EVER!! Anytime I‚Äôm near the restaurant I have to stop and get iced Thai tea because it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve ever had!! I rave about this place to anyone and everyone asking for restaurant suggestions. Not only is it my ‚Ä¶
35,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Second visit. Called the restaurant to order take-out. I‚Äôll definitely give a 8 out of 5 to the amazing food: including the tom yum, pad Thai  and I believe everything on the menuüëçüèº I feel that I wanna try everything here. ‚Ä¶"
36,Sugar & Spice, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Before reading my review I would like to say I grew up in Thailand. So this review is written as a Thai person who wanted Thai food... something that tastes like what I would eat in Thailand, a good balance of sour salty sweet and sometimes ‚Ä¶"
37,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This place... is amazing. Literally every dish is amazing and cooked with love. You can tell this place is authentic, and they care about every aspect of your experience. Since I've been in Boston this is my go to place, to bring both friends and family. I would give it 10 stars if I could."
38,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Red curry was good! A bit light on sauce but high on flavor and plenty of meat, which is nice. I wish the Tom Yum soup was a bit more flavorful, it tasted a bit bland to me (I prefer Kor Tor Mor‚Äôs version, personally)."
39,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,7 months ago,So delicious and authentic thai food. Can't wait to go back.
40,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Everything was excellent. Presentation was beautiful and price was surprisingly low for everything we got. ‚Ä¶
41,Sugar & Spice, 3 stars ,3 months ago,By far one of the worst pad Thai‚Äôs I‚Äôve had. Absolutely no taste and extremely oily. I‚Äôm not sure how they got it all wrong but it had no taste what so ever‚Ä¶ lacked any peanut sauce and was just full of oil. It was my first time trying the ‚Ä¶
42,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"In my opinion, its the best Thai food in Boston otherwise in the East Coast. Goid service. Some food is so special like. Khao yum (‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏≥) or miang (‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏á) so hard to find even in Thailand. Price are right. Another dont miss."
43,Sugar & Spice, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food and service but the place is not clean. I saw couple of roaches crawling on the seats. There are a lot of flies in restrooms which are located right beside the kitchen. Some flies just came down for a swim in my beer glass. Very unhiegenic. If you still want to try it, better take a seat outside."
44,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We enjoyed a delicious meal here! There was an entire vegan menu as well as gluten free menu which was a pleasant surprise. We ordered: vegan pad Thai, vegan kow soi, vegan massman curry and seafood my love. All delicious! We ended the meal ‚Ä¶"
45,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"The food is consistently, awesomely good! Order what you want and you won't be disappointed.  : )"
46,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Ordered three dishes, none of which was really good.  Crispy Basil Chicken was not crispy, nor did I see more than 1-2 pieces of basil.  Instead, it had peas and carrots (frozen or can) and pineapple.  Really gross and not spicy or crispy. ‚Ä¶"
47,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great Thai food!! This small restaurant has some unique and delicious dishes. I came into town for a friend‚Äôs wedding and tried out this place. The curry and the fried rice were all fantastic. Highly recommend this place for casual family and friends gatherihga

50,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,a year ago,The food is great. But I have had to many issues. FIRST AND FOREMOST. THEY HAVE TO STOP PUTTING THE DUCK SAUCE FILLED WITH DUCK SAUCE IN THE ACTUAL FOOD PLATE. MY PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE MELTS THE PLASTIC EVERY TIME BEFORE I GET HOME. I DON'T ‚Ä¶
51,Sugar & Spice, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Unhygienic and unsafe place. Table was sticky and not cleaned, water glasses had lipstick marks. Staff was unfriendly when requested to clean the table and provide clean water glasses. I had to leave the place before ordering as I was feeling really unsafe inside the restaurant."
52,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really like the way Sugar & Spice is going with their menu. Food is categorized by regions of Thailand (Northern, Central and Southern). We got Boat Noodles and Chicken on Fire. If I went again, would probably only get the chicken for a ‚Ä¶"
53,Sugar & Spice, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I ordered the Pad Thai - Thai Hot. Not only was it not spicy, it had absolutely no taste at all! Very disappointing to go to a Thai place and have this experience with such a signature dish."
54,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Excellent setup with ample outdoor seating in a beautiful area of the city.  Plenty of vegan options with some excellent sauce and perfectly cooked crispy tofu!  Absolutely loved the meal and fresh made bubble tea.  Definitely recommend!
55,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"It's good portions, but make sure you get the family size with no rice."
56,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The place is constantly full of people and that's a good indicator the restaurant is good, but oh boy my expectations were 20 times better, One of the best if not the best pad thai ever!"
57,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,10 months ago,This place serves truly authentic Thai cuisine which is a rare find in Boston area. I personally just know few places who do that. The combination of flavors one can find in S&S dishes is remarkable. What we also like is that their menu is ‚Ä¶
58,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there for lunch because an Indian friend recommended it to us.  The service was great, but the curry came with little curry sauce, minimum spice - even though we asked them to make it as spicy as possible.  The vegetables in the curry ‚Ä¶"
59,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Their food quality is good and tasty. Even though not very authentic Thai food and seems like fusion but I like their food.
60,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty good! Not the best Thai I've had before hence the 4 stars, but overall pretty good. Service was fast, decor was interesting... and pricing was overall reasonable."
61,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Authentic and tasty dishes with a lot of options for vegetarians! Great selection of sweet and savory dishes and it all tasted very fresh. Loved the beautiful flowers and decorations in the outdoor seating area.
62,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a week ago,Outstanding service and food! Great atmosphere and music selection.
63,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Once upon a rainy day in New England, a man stood at a bus stop waiting for his ride to appear through the misty rain. A delicious smell wafted into the man's nose...and he was drawn towards Sugar and Spice. He sat, he ate, and as the warm ‚Ä¶"

65,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"I ordered Udon noodles per their menu, when I got there to pick up my order I was told they didn‚Äôt have any udon noodles, very disappointed."
66,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"I'm giving it a 4 because of the way they handle takeout and delivery services. They let the crowds of people waiting for their orders to crowd in. I was sitting at a table near the front, and people were right on top of me. ‚Ä¶"
67,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I went to this place several times. The food always great and the staffs also super polite. The restaurant usually busy Friday night. Recommended menu -- Tom Yam Sukothai ! The best.
68,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a year ago,"OH MY GOD!!!! I never write reviews but this place deserves a 1000000000000 stars!!! The most delicious vegan, gluten free Thai food I‚Äôve ever had. The mango sticky rice is to die for. I‚Äôm in food heaven. The crab fried rice is 10000/10!! ‚Ä¶"
69,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Solid pad see ew. I like that they have gluten free options. However, some of their food is a tad on the oily side."
70,Sugar & Spice, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,There should be just for take out. They have slots of online orders and take outs that their kitchen can not keep up with. Waiting at our table for more than 45 minutes and there is no food yet.
71,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Incredibly vibrant flavors, melding well. Fried dishes were crisp and not too oily, sauces were flavory but not cloying. Outdoor seating was pleasant, surprising given it was right at the heart of commercial Porter Sq."
72,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food here brought us back to our experiences in Thailand. It's that good, can't wait to go back."
73,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Most tasty Thai food I tried in recent times. Like the name says sugar and spices are perfectly balanced in all the dishes.. Highly recommend..
74,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The top of the list of things I don't trust include people with slimy handshakes and restaurants with menus that are too big. I was admittedly a little skeptical before getting takeout from here, because the menu seemed massive. No ‚Ä¶"
75,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I love it! It's my first time here, even it's far from my home. Everything is good, and the waiter is so kind and friendly. Nice experienceüòÅ"
76,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,a year ago,This place came recommended to me and I‚Äôm just not feeling it. I ordered 2 Tom Yum with chicken and they came with shrimp instead and it tasted like water. I also got the massaman beef curry and it was over $16 and didn‚Äôt come rice. Not a huge deal but I expected so much more. The pad see ew was OK.
77,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The food was good but the service was really subpar. We had 6 in our party and the pushed together two different sized tables and crammed us together with one table being much smaller than the other.
78,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The Kanom Jean Nam Ngiao is the best Thai dish I've ever had!!

80,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Sugar & Spice is close to my heart, as it was my first authentic Thai food experience. The freshness of the food is remarkable. I‚Äôve had at least 10 different dishes and each one tells a unique story from Thailand‚Äôs rich history. The staff ‚Ä¶"
81,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I love the Thai here. The best or close to the best in all of Boston. My usual is the Boat Noodle Soup, it is consistently delish every time."
82,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a year ago,I love this restaurant! It was recommended to me by a friend a few months ago and I have been getting food from them frequently since - the curry is top quality and they have great vegan options :) I went last night for a takeout order and ‚Ä¶
83,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a year ago,My go-to place for Thai food in the Cambridge and Somerville area! I love that they have so many unique choices that aren‚Äôt found on the typical Thai menu. Takeout portions are always generous.
84,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Second time eating here. They have a new menu layout that I like. They grouped dishes by regional origin for the flavors and they seem to have a range of options. I had a sweet beef curry that was better than I anticipated! Dishes of other ‚Ä¶

96,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Disappointing food. The Pad Thai did not have scallions or peanuts - just noodles, sprouts and tofu. It was pretty tasteless. The dumplings appetizer was oily, and only 2 pieces. The red curry was ok, but the carrots were undercooked - ‚Ä¶"
97,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Not the best place for vegetarians. But for meat-eaters, one of the best Thai restaurants in America (and I've been to too many!)"
98,Sugar & Spice, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Excellent food in both taste and presentation. Poor poor service, inadequate staffing for the amount of tables. Must reduce seating capacity until labor shortage has passed!"
99,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Truly amazing and unique Thai cuisine presented in a very beautiful way. When the food looks that good, the flavor is so much more enjoyable."
100,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Sugar & Spice was recommended to me by my hotel staff, and they were absolutely right: This is the best padthai I've ever had. The staff was a bit short with me, but they were really busy so I get that entirely. The serving size was MASSIVE and so flavorful. Definitely go give them a visit!"
101,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This particular visit the service was not so great but I'm giving it four stars because I believe it was due to other customers giving them a hard time. Our server was always apologetic and was trying very hard to make sure things were ‚Ä¶
102,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great vegan menu. Well priced. Friendly staff. Cute enough ambience. Only reason it's not five stars is because they've cross contaminated my food a couple times. Other than that they're lovely
103,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Outdoor and indoor seating . Yummy food . Friendly staffs . Come and check it out . You will love it .
104,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Favourite restaurant in Somerville! Tried a new dish every time I visited, and I was never disappointed. My favourite dish, and go-to recommendation is the Kang Hung Lay - a perfect mix of sweetness, acidity, and spice (of course), and the pork belly really adds to the depth of flavour."
105,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great menu selection and friendly staff but the food was a bit too sweet
106,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best Thai in Boston, hands down, IMHO. Maybe some Thai restaurants have a better dish or appetizer, but if you want the confidence to order anything on the menu, then Sugar & Spice is everything nice..."
107,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity of food at this restaurant. It is the best Thai food that I can think of in the area. I've tried both the crispy duck and the drunken noodles; the flavors and textures were just what I was hoping for.
108,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Surprisingly delicious!! I came here on Eastern Sunday for dinner and it was pretty empty. The waitress recommended a noodle soup to me which was very tasty! Will come back again to try other interesting dishes on the menu next time!
109,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Delicious food, love their panag curry."
110,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,11 months ago,Their dishes can vary in tastiness but I overall really like them. Very quick pick up and high quality food!
111,Sugar & Spice, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A good option for Thai food in the Porter Square area. Their menu has a wide selection of dishes that can be customized to your liking. They also have online ordering which is very convenient. Mostly a takeout place but they do have some ‚Ä¶
112,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,8 months ago,They're very gluten free friendly and have a really nice staff who patiently worked out an issue from a Toast app order.
113,Sugar & Spice, 1 star ,10 months ago,"Today when i picked up my food, there was several pieces of hair in my noodles. This is unacceptable and very unsanitary. I would not recommend this is very disgusting and shouldn‚Äôt happen."
114,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice cozy place right off the porter square station. The waitresses are very welcoming in taking into account of your preference. I went down with a few of my friends and we loved the scallion pancakes and the crispy noodles.
115,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Great place! They have many authentic dishes and lean spicier than most Thai restaurants in the Boston area.
116,Sugar & Spice, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I had dinner alone, ordered crispy basil chicken  for  $14. It did not come with any rice so i ordered a side of brown rice for $2. The dish had more chiken than vegetables. It was rather greasy than crispy. Paid over $20 ended up with a ‚Ä¶"
117,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is amazing. Presentation is nothing short of incredible. Drinks were out of this world, they made a sake fan out of me. Friendly and tentative staff! My new favorite restaurant in the  Boston area :)"
118,Sugar & Spice, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I had previously been a loyal customer to Sugar and Spice, but was disappointed when I recently ordered a dish with ""the Pad Thai noodles"" and when they didn't make it with the noodles I was imagining, was only met with contempt and made to ‚Ä¶"

120,Sugar & Spice, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Sugar & Spice has wonderful food, some of my favorite in Boston. But their delivery service has consistently delivered at least an hour late, 4 times in a row now, I really wish I was exaggerating. If you're in the neighborhood, stop in and ‚Ä¶"

124,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wonderful local Thai restaurant.  Food is consistently good and they do a terrific job with allergies.  My family has celiac and we eat here often because they have a clearly marked gluten free menu and are always careful.
125,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I got the most delicious salmon curry served inside of a coconut. I would highly recommend that dish. Six of us were very happy with our meals.
126,Sugar & Spice, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"My family loves this restaurant fro multiple reasons other than their food, especially their flexibility about food. I'm vegetarian while the rest of my family isn't. The great thing about this restaurant is that we could all get the pad ‚Ä¶"
