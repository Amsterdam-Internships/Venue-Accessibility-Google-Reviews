The cheese sticks were filled with a gorgonzola type cheese.  Black and green olives with a few peppers were quite nice. ‚Ä¶"
1,Argentijns Steakhouse Castillo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent tapas spot with top notch service and a fun vibe. The food is delicious and there are great choices for tapas.

10,Argentijns Steakhouse Castillo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Changed my order according to the waiter's 'recommendation' but the tenderest steak in their menu is not as tender as I ate.

12,Argentijns Steakhouse Castillo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The service was really good. The food was mediocre in presentation and taste. I heard good things about their red meat, but I went with grilled salmon, which was kind of ok. Salads were not very fresh. And fries were forgettable."

Les tapas √©taient excellents, large choix possible. Et la sangria √©tait tr√®s bonne √©galement. Le personnel √©tait tr√®s agr√©able :)"
