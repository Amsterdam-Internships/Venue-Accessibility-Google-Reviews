0,Amarylles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect for eating waffles. Whole family liked what they ordered and service minded personal. Guess you can pay with card if your bill is high enough. Only maestro thou. Great waffles and tasty with allot of choices to order. Mid priced I guess. Great for some relaxing and ""fika"""
1,Amarylles, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best pancakes I've ever had and most delicious orange juice too. The waitresses were lovely and we had a great breakfast with great views of the flower market. Everyone here is complaining about price... But its in one of the most touristic areas of the city so it's kinda normal for around there.
2,Amarylles, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Very big food menu but after ordering the lady told me that she did not have half the menu. Also interieur looked really cheap and old. ‚Ä¶
3,Amarylles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food and amazing service. It's the 3rd time I've been in Amsterdam, and I've been here every time. Delicious food and freshly pressed orange juice! üòç"
4,Amarylles, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cheeseburger was surprisingly good.  Read a lot of negative comments about the staff but good we didn't experience that.  In front of Bloemenmarket.
5,Amarylles, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I don't have a clue what the other reviews did to the staff to upset them but the staff could not have been nicer. We got a table very quickly, the table was clean. We got severed drinks quickly and our orders were taken quickly and the ‚Ä¶"
6,Amarylles, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Tourist trap. Should have read the reviews... Expensive or rather poor value for money. 8 Euro for 2 cups of tea and a thimble full of milk. But being overcharged is totally my responsibility...on the positive side..seating was comfortable. Toilets were small but acceptably clean. Location is good.
7,Amarylles, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Don't visit this restaurant, it's a tourist trap! Worst experience we had on our trip to Amsterdam. The staff pretended to not understand us properly. We ordered 24 Poffertjes, got 12, asked for the other 12 and paid 2x12 instead of one ‚Ä¶"
8,Amarylles, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"There are a lot of 1 star reviews here but they must have turned themselves around because I had fantastic service, a cheerful waitress and some delicious apple pie! Would recommend as a place to stop and admire some of your purchases from the nearby flower market."
9,Amarylles, 1 star ,3 years ago,We went to this place for a coffee and pancakes. We pointed to the poster of mini pancakes on the wall as they waitress didn't speak English. We presented with full size pancakes. When we said we ordered mini pancakes there was an argument ‚Ä¶
10,Amarylles, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really fast serving, but that was the only good point on this restaurant. My water was from Aldi (discounter) and the spareribs were dry and didn't taste that good. Also the toilets weren't clean."
11,Amarylles, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Reasonable food, poor service. Staff was polite but I wanted a bagel and got served white bread. They would not serve any tap water. Prices were average but not cheap."
12,Amarylles, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We all really enjoyed our lunches here. Great pea soup and the sandwiches are healthy. Service is rushed, but friendly and competent. Bathrooms are popular among tourists, so avoid sitting at the rear table."
13,Amarylles, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Food is good but waitor is terrible, because of him i won't bring any friends there anymore nor group as i'm a tour guide. He shouldn't be a waitor, wrong profession and gives bad image to the restaurant. They also want you to pay in cash and if you insist paying with card the waiter say ""oh you have cash but you don't wanna give it?"""
14,Amarylles, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unfriendly service (seems friendly but only at first), mediocre food at best, directly at the Bloemenmarket. Ended there for one menu item. Suffered badly. We should have read the reviews first."

16,Amarylles, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We had a good experience of both food and service.  It did what it was supposed to and our children enjoyed their breakfast.  Quick and painless.

22,Amarylles, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Service was good, food was bad...spareribs kinda dry and rubbery like yesterday food or reheated ones...not cheap either...free WiFi and rest room for customers. Avoid if possible, but when in urgent need to stop then don't expect much from this place."
