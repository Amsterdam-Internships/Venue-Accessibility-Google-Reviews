17,Pizza Taxi Da Paolo & Seba, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We ordered three pizzas from here - margherita, napoletana and bufalina - expecting good Neapolitan pizzas. All of them had Dutch cheese on them - the cheap industrial tosti kind. I can still taste it in my mouth and feel it repeating in my stomach. What self-respecting Italian puts Dutch cheese on a pizza?"
