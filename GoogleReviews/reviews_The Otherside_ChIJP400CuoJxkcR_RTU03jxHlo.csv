1,The Otherside, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Such good vibes here. I came two years ago and found it by chance, went several times during my week stay. Then this year I had a 24 hour layover, went there and had a great chat with the owner, super nice. They even have a daily cat ‚Ä¶"
2,The Otherside, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the better coffeeshops in Amsterdam. Yummie Bubblegum joints and the music is always great. When in Amsterdam,  you can find me here quite often. XXX Anette"
3,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice cool and cosy place for an afternoon smoke in the city.

Friendly service and great atmosphere."
4,The Otherside, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice, place to be for chilling.
Not too crowdy.
You can sit down and relax.
Friendly staff."
5,The Otherside, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We really liked the atmosphere in the shop. The windows were full of Christmas lights, they played classic housemusic, the weed was tasty and we were fly and happy. We definitely would come back to the otherside :)"
6,The Otherside, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"One of the best coffeeshops in the center. Good staff, decent coffee and great music"
7,The Otherside, 1 star ,4 months ago,Very rude and unfriendly staff. Was told that i have to smoke there - otherwise id have to order take away coffee. Never coming here again
8,The Otherside, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The Otherside used to be in my backyard and is definitely one of the best coffeeshops in Amsterdam. A heartwarming staff and a great menu. Can definitely recommend.
9,The Otherside, 1 star ,4 months ago,Really unfriendly host. It‚Äôs is mandatory to buy weed if you want to have a coffee or tee.
10,The Otherside, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best coffeshop in the city. Nice music and good deal.
11,The Otherside, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Super chill place with friendly staff! Definitely recommend coming here
12,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my fave coffee shops. It's very relaxed and not too noisy. I particularly like it because it's not one of those super intense social coffee shops but instead was friendly and relaxing. ‚Ä¶
13,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have been going over 25 years here. Its one of my first herbal coffee shops and is just chill. Good weed, good coffee and small n intimate w good music and art. Gone is the rotating toilet seat that would rotate and be cleaned after ‚Ä¶"
14,The Otherside, 5 stars ,7 months ago,It is a very nice coffeeshop with good material and good prices. I liked the lemon haze a lot
15,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Relaxed atmosphere. The owner does not allow groups with more than 5 people, which grants the place a cozy atmosphere. Great music selection and good choice of weed and hash."
16,The Otherside, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"While in Amsterdam I went to many coffee shops and this by far was the best. The environment was calm and the music was just right. Unlike other coffee shops,  the pre-roll I purchased was high quality and actually gave a good buzz.  Staff are friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back the next time I visit."
17,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Helpful and knowledgeable staff, a very good spread and a neighborhood feel.
We saw a deaf person come in the morning for coffee and a joint, and the girl at the counter immidiately understood him and gave him a great service with a smile. You have to appreciate that"
18,The Otherside, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent coffeeshop great place to spend some time, be warned however that just buying drinks and smoking your own is not permitted, a purchase from the herbal menu is required. I haven't been to the city for six years so this may not be unusual now. Other than that, great place."
19,The Otherside, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly place, decent prices. When you roll inside, usually some herbs available to mix. Cat is cute"
20,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,Owners care more about you buying a drink every 2 minutes instead of keeping the place clean and making you feel welcome. Very rude service and very poor quality weed at a poor price compared to what else is on offer in Amsterdam. Suprised ‚Ä¶
21,The Otherside, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Ambiance of the place was alright, cozy with tables and big photos of celebrities blazing. Weed was low quality , had to turn down the Purple Haze, looked very stemmy and small sad buds with hints of purple. Settled for a big bud (coming ‚Ä¶"
22,The Otherside, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Weird vibe, bartender was a bit rude, can't stay there if you are only there for the weed, you have to order a drink too. Atmosphere is fine, but the weed got us pretty fuccd up. My recommendation is sativa silver i think it called, 1.2g for about 15 euros."
23,The Otherside, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Since the first time in 1995 The Other Side is kind of my starting off place when visiting Amsterdam. Laid back with a decent level of weed choices or edibles. It's also a great location in the city and is on the gay street. Cheers!
24,The Otherside, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Average coffeeshop with average (slightly frosty) service. Very strict no drink without purchase rule even for groups making multiple purchases. Otherwise a decent vibe with good music and ventilation etc.
25,The Otherside, 1 star ,4 years ago,Not very welcoming.   The guy was rude and abrupt.   Wouldn't serve me coffee unless I was buying.  Explained one of our group wanted to buy but he was having none of it as we all weren't buying. ...see ya!  Took our business elsewhere and shan't return.  Everyone I know will also be warned about going here.
26,The Otherside, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Good small shop. The water a bit expensive.
27,The Otherside, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worse coffeeshops I have been too. When me and my patner went into the coffeeshop just for a coffee we were rudely informed that we can't just buy coffee that we have to get weed too. That I wouldn't of minded, as its his place. But it ‚Ä¶"
28,The Otherside, 1 star ,2 years ago,"visiting amsterdam for almost 20 years now. never experienced such a rude behavior. practically got kicked out after ordering something to drink. quote, ‚Äúwe are not a cafeteria!‚Äù. it‚Äôs really ‚Äòthe other side‚Äô of amsterdam, it‚Äôs the bad side!"
29,The Otherside, 1 star ,5 years ago,Great spot if you're a white supremacist. After an otherwise pleasant day in Amsterdam my cousin and I walked into this rubbish establishment where we saw 2 available stools by the bar. I asked the guy sitting at the bar if someone was ‚Ä¶
30,The Otherside, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Quite cramped with little airflow in the shop. The guys behind the counter was not very welcoming and seemed quite rude while tryi g to speak to him and ask about the product. Decent weed though.
31,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,The man behind the bar is extremly rude. He kept giving us this weird disgusting look all the time. Threatened that he'll close the place in 30 min although it was only 10:30pm! Then came to us in 15 min shouting that he wants to close NOW. ‚Ä¶
32,The Otherside, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Awful not decent service.

If you've been brought up well then you know WATER is NEVER denied to ANYONE! A ‚Ä¶"
33,The Otherside, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Would've been good to be given the advice we should start with half a space cake not a whole one each. Having had a whole one each one friend was severely paranoid for 3 hours having to be calmed down and another was sick. Being three young female (obvious) tourists some advice would have been welcome.
34,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,Unpleasant owners. Very rude and clearly losing money as they are counting the space cakes with their bare unwashed fingers and make customers wait 10 minutes in line for a shift change. The staff is so awkward as to not enrage the owners. Lol
35,The Otherside, 1 star ,5 years ago,Never again: was looking for a friendly place and the owner was a first Queen! Rude and only looking for money! He was pushing us to buy his stuff before even ordering a glass of water: terrible customer service and experience. Also be carefull as some of the joints are loaded very light!
36,The Otherside, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I got the chance to have a nice experience there, unlikely other here.
The bartender (beard guy) was very helpful and I liked the music.
Really chill and not crowded"
37,The Otherside, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Small and cozy place close to the ""Flower Market"". You need to buy a drink or something inside if you want to roll your own stuff inside. They will always ask for you ID card before ordering something. ‚Ä¶"
38,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not allowed to smoke your own stuff, not allowed to buy any drinks unless you buy their stuff. Got yelled at unessesarily for smoking when I didnt know, they didnt have any signs or anything saying that you werent allowed to do these things. Probably the worst coffeeshop in Amsterdam."
39,The Otherside, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Quiet and not touristy. Really enjoyed a cosy afternoon in this slightly old world vibe coffeeshop. I love how old the building seems and the cool lights and art work. Definitely a new favourite.
40,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst coffee shop in Amsterdam , I was none to apprecirered by the extremely rude bud-tendor , he had a face on him like a melted welly and was just a complete gimp over all . Overall experience I was none to plussed about . Also the weed was proper Scag.
-3/10"
41,The Otherside, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Barman was a real nasty piece of work. Do not recommend, worst place we have visited and also the worst vibe we have felt while being here. Betty boop down the road recovered our positivity destroyed by the barman at the other side. On my 25th birthday too!"
42,The Otherside, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Awful service. We entered to buy a latte and have a smoke. When we got to the front of the queue, despite both of us being clearly over 25 the server asked for our ID - the first time in 2days  heavy smoking. When we said we didn't have ‚Ä¶"
43,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place to visit, fair prices, nice atmosphere. Just make sure don't smoke your own in there or you'll get shouted at! üòÇ"
44,The Otherside, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Nicely furnished, tastefully decorated. The weed is superb! Had the Orange Bud and it's definetely something. This Coffeeshop is definetely not ""touristy"", instead it has style and inviting to have a great conversation and enjoy the afternoon."
45,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good atmosphere, brilliant art work. Amazing vibes all throughout. If you're in damn it's a must go to cafe."
46,The Otherside, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really relaxed atmosphere with friendly staff. Good prices. We used the other side as our go to cafe for the whole of our holiday x
47,The Otherside, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very unfriendly owner that sent us out because we didn't want to buy his weed.

Really can't recommend this place"
48,The Otherside, 5 stars ,a year ago,My bf bought the pure ones and he said those were the best ones. The man working there is very nice.
49,The Otherside, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good atmosphere, chilled music and a nice clean table - what more could you want? It was very busy when we arrived but it quietened down quickly"
50,The Otherside, 1 star ,5 months ago,Their ‚Äúpure‚Äù product has tobacco in it.
51,The Otherside, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"been dam 3 times and this is still my favourite coffee shop. friendly owner, lovely spot and quality bud (but the hash is better). lots of love for this place xox"
52,The Otherside, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I bought a few of their pure weed pre rolls and when I got home, then i decided to open one of them up and found some of the worst weed I have ever seen, it is dark brown, dry, has no visual trichomes and smells like dirt, So choose wisely where you get your product here"
53,The Otherside, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Not the coziest place in the world, but what did you expect? :) Personal is helpful, prices are okay.
You are forbidden to smoke cigarettes here, and do not forget your ID card."
54,The Otherside, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great latte s also.  Bubble gum flavored weed. Only place you could find it. Tucked around the the corner yet quaint. Some good space cake available...
55,The Otherside, 1 star ,4 years ago,The TRASHY OLD BASTARD working behind the bar who was a QUEEN and very rude was asking us and other people rudely not to smoke any joints you have unless you buy some from the shop even though we ordered many drinks and cakes ! although we ‚Ä¶
56,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,if you get your weed yesterday u can‚Äôt come back tomorrow to smoke more and just drink coffee. The rude attendant almost kicked me out of the place. Such a disgusting place. Spent 2 minutes in the place and I really don‚Äôt recommend you to waste your time!
57,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst coffeeshop we had been in our trip, only accepts cash, he forces you to order his horrible weed for ordering drinks and despite that he doesn't allow you to smoke anything else. Avoid this place like plague."
58,The Otherside, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The man behind the counter tried to short change, me when I held out my hand he knew what I was saying and went to the register and got exactly what I had been shorted ,mistakes happen this was no mistake. The day before I went and a different person waited on me no problems  careful TRUST but count your change"
59,The Otherside, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Had some purple haze and some white widow purple haze was ok but i like the white widow purple haze wasnt good this is my first time in amsterdam but im from cali so weed is my thing four stars cuz i got to sit and smoke and not have to buy a juice . Other one i went to i had to buy a drink soda that is . Just see a sample before u buy .
60,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible place!! I went to this place on a sunday afternoon, 29th April. The man behind the counter is extremely rude. He wouldnt even answer my questions. Seriously, if you want to go to a coffeeshop and if it is your first time, do not come here!"
61,The Otherside, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Five stars for this magnificent place. Very good taste in decoration and very good selection of drinks and joints. The owner very friendly and the atmosphere excellent.
62,The Otherside, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a really nice coffeeshop, great atmosphere and decent music. Quality and prices are good too, a really nice place to chill out with a smoke and a cup of tea."
63,The Otherside, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very friendly staff. The place is very nice and gives you the feeling of a normal coffeebar. Prices are very good.
Very nice place for couples or girls by themselves."
64,The Otherside, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Its a cosy atmosphere.  Guy behind the counter was neutral. The pre rolled stuff is more expensive here than in other places so if you can't roll probably look elsewhere
65,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In my opinion one of the best coffee shops in town ! In a great location , very cosy and friendly !"
66,The Otherside, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Staff were very aloof, and not exactly a friendly atmosphere, but the prices are average and the d√©cor is interesting enough. There are better places you could go, but there are worse by far."
67,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice and clean the the guys who run the coffee shop are very helpful would go back there
68,The Otherside, 1 star ,a year ago,"I‚Äôve smoked 2 rolled joints and I feel nothing, don‚Äôt take the rolled ones."
69,The Otherside, 1 star ,6 years ago,The guy working there was miserable and clearly bored. The music was awful and made us paranoid and there was no atmosphere .. Better off going somewhere else that's Cosy and nice
70,The Otherside, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent coffeeshop at the corner of what was called Rue de Vaseline, the main gay street of Amsterdam. Now that is history, but The Otherside's still going strong. Favorite staff members: Andr√© Gregor and Nick."
71,The Otherside, 1 star ,5 years ago,I specifically asked if S brownies were effective and he said pretty effective. Sadly it was like having sand brownie plus it didn't do jack. Just got duped
72,The Otherside, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place cozy but thinner joint with high price; good for visit; next to Euroclear Amsterdam office ;)
73,The Otherside, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very Nice place , there're  two rooms,  one is to smoke And The other one √¨s just to  take something to drink. There's buble  jointüîù"

77,The Otherside, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The weed there is trash. I ended up throwing the rest away. I never tried their top shelf though, that could be a different story."
78,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,First coffee shop experience and it was the best compared to the rest I visited.
79,The Otherside, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little place with lovely window seats if you're lucky. Reasonable prices, cash only."
80,The Otherside, 5 stars ,5 years ago,One of the only cofeeshop with decent music. The guy behind is pretty cool if you're mature enough to smoke you darn teens!
81,The Otherside, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nice atmosphere. Good music. Reasonable prices. Grumpy bartender!
82,The Otherside, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Decent coffee shop. Half the price of the bulldog round the corner and is a more traditional Amsterdam style coffeeshop
83,The Otherside, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best I have found out here quality service and some very nice bud. Bubble gum bio and crystal are tasty
84,The Otherside, 4 stars ,a year ago,Coudn¬¥t by any coffe :-( very sad. But the brownie was good
85,The Otherside, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Cosy relaxed decent music. Can be quiet then really busy. Nice weed friendly staff

102,The Otherside, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Local type of place. Coffee and other stuff. Worth a visit when in the area. Better prices than the central places.
103,The Otherside, 1 star ,3 years ago,Got a joint for the walk home and it fell apart within seconds. Poorly rolled and not worth the price. Avoid the prerolls.
