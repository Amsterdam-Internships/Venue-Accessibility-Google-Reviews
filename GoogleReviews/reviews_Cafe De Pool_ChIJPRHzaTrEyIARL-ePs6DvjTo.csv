Would recommend Miami Vice
Make sure you double clarify the timings with Concierge as well as the website - employees seem to be confused always on timings."
2,Cafe De Pool, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Recommend the Miami Vice frozen when it's over 100Â° our. Servers are on top of the pool deck too. Great stuff.

13,Cafe De Pool, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the chicken sandwich and wings, was pleasantly surprised. Good, not amazing but nice for a poolside lunch under misters to get out of the heat. One note, most alcohol beverages are $20+ a piece."
