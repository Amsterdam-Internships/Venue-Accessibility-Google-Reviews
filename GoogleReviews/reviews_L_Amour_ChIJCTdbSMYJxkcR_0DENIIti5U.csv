0,L'Amour, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"Absolutely disgusting food.
How can anyone have the audacity to serve food so bad?
Everything looks like it has been out for a while so we asked the waiter if they …"
1,L'Amour, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Avoid this place at all costs!!! We were greeted with rudeness and paid over €18 for 2 coffees, a bagel and a pastry all of which was less than average food. My pastry came fried/grilled with chocolate all over it which I didn’t ask for and …"
2,L'Amour, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Very rude and disrespectful, I ask for a bill. He said I won’t give you. Do what you want to do!"
3,L'Amour, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Cookies are amazing and also the toast 5 stars. The smoothies are so worth it, you need to get one!!"
4,L'Amour, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Chocolate cookie was good, the bagel was alright. The coffee was under average and the orange juice was alright. I paid 27€ for these 4 items - so absolutely overpriced and feels like a tourist trap. Happened to me, shouldn’t happen to anyone else. Amsterdam has way better places to grab food - unfortunately we were in a hurry."
5,L'Amour, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice selection of products, maybe too expensive considering  how is the store. Waffle starts from 4€"
6,L'Amour, 1 star ,a year ago,When passing by this store we noticed amazing looking sweets so we went in to have a better look. The staff weren’t very friendly but we craved a sweet treat and they looked delish so we ended up with an eclair and an oreo brownie. We had …
7,L'Amour, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The desserts were okay, but extremely over priced. It was 8 Euros for a single pastry, which is the exact same as the ones you can get anywhere in the area. It's not price competitive and the pastry was okay, but nothing extraordinary so I …"
8,L'Amour, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice variety of desserts, waffles, cheese cakes be lots of chocolate / caramel tasty stuff …"
9,L'Amour, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We has two bagels, one was mozzarella and tomatoes and the other was chicken curry and lettuce. The tomatoes werent very fresh but overall they were quite nice. …"
10,L'Amour, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Extremely overpriced mediocre shop. Was in a hurry and need a very quick on the go bite, so  I got lured in by the ""bagel"" sign on the window. Ordered 2 bagels without really looking at the menu and was shocked at the 10 euro price! 5 euro …"
11,L'Amour, 1 star ,3 years ago,"!!!DO NOT GO THERE!!! - 10 STARS!!!!

The food is under average and way overpriced! …"
12,L'Amour, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very expensive... 8 Euro for a crepe? Seriously? Plus the pasteries have no pricing so they can charge you whatever they want. It's not like their pasteries are that fantastic anyway.  Better to find another Cafe down the street.
13,L'Amour, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good croissants. Nice coffee. A bit expensive but not too much.
14,L'Amour, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ripp off!! 12 euros for a strawberry cake an 10 euros for a donut. When i asked for a receipt there was a ""luxury waffle"" and 2 donuts on it. I asked him to explain this and then he suddenly pretends to have problems to talk english by …"
15,L'Amour, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ok, so we were high and in a desperate need for a coffee and something sweet, so we felt into a trap. Though looking very cute from outside, cakes were awful! Anyway, 3 of those and 2 coffees = 25€ ouch! And no toilet in the end! Luckily Amsterdam has good places to offer as well, it's just they are not on the main streets, obviously."
16,L'Amour, 1 star ,3 years ago,"11€ a peace of a horrible chocolat cake + tee, cockroachs in the restaurant... Do never go there."
17,L'Amour, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The cheesecake was given hot, which was odd, and expected more for the €7 we gave for it. We got back in there after munchies for other things, from €6 to €10, and they were hit or miss, still far too expensive."
18,L'Amour, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The first impression is deceptive. We ordered a crepe for 7€, which was completely different to the crepes in the display window. After eating 1/3 of the crepe we found a hair in it. So we talked to the waiter, who asked us if everything is …"
19,L'Amour, 1 star ,2 years ago,Poor food hygiene; €6 for a stale Belgian waffle; 20 minute wait for 4 people; burnt bagel and stale waffle. Picturesque & cute shop but would not honestly recommend.
20,L'Amour, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Ordered two coffees, a smoothie and waffle with whipped cream, strawberries and blackberries. Got a HAIR in my waffle and, despite being friendly, the staff didn't care to make it up to us. The beverages were good though."
21,L'Amour, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Three awful cookies full of sugar and 2 bad coffee for 25eur. We couldn't see the prices, so we assume that guy is cheater. No restroom. C'mon guys read these reviews and make your bakery better place!!!"
22,L'Amour, 1 star ,3 years ago,"what an evil place to be - crooks who feed people terrible cheesecakes

their cheesecake is wet inside out, what the fk?"
23,L'Amour, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Charged 5 euros for a muffin that was only 3 euros in the shop across the street. Looked at me like I was a thief when I told him I had taken only one. I mean, it wasn't even physically possible to fit more than one muffin in that tiny bag …"
24,L'Amour, 1 star ,3 years ago,WARNING! A total rip off  for stupid tourists. Average products and random prices should you forget to ask. A waffle for 13 Euro. Avoid this place at all costs or it will cost you dearly.
