2,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Hands down this is one of the best brunch spots in Amsterdam. If you love mushrooms and truffles, the Forest Dwellers is the one to order. And the pumpkin pancakes will leave you in mascarpone heaven"

5,Dignita, 4 stars ,5 months ago,I love this place! But make reservations it's always super full. I enjoyed the eggs but the chicken sandwich is awesome. Great place for lunch during the week as well.

17,Dignita, 3 stars ,a year ago,Booked in advance and in the reservation they asked  to come 15 min earlier as to have the table ready. We arrived 15 min in advance how are were sat at the table after around 25 min: what's the point in asking to come earlier if you don't ‚Ä¶

26,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food, came there again in a three day trip as it was so amazing. Everything we tried was brilliantly executed. Nice service. A bit of waiting on the weekend around brunch time as place seems really popular. Pancakes are... fantastic üòç"

29,Dignita, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A cafe with a good cause that serves FANTASTIC food and even better coffee! Speculas Mocha made my day. Regular coffee was made to perfection. Beny Benedict was comfort brunch and a dish to be ordered again. Ox cheeks burger, although ‚Ä¶"

37,Dignita, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious, fresh food! Best brunch in my life so far. The only thing I didn't like were the extremely long queue to get a table and the fact that tables were placed very close to each other and the location was very loud; not a great place ‚Ä¶"

39,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We went here for breakfast on the last day of our trip and wished we would have came more. The coffee and food was so good. I will say it was probably the most affordable breakfast establishment we went to as their prices were 5-10 euros ‚Ä¶
40,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place was fully packed and we had to wait for 15 minutes - which is nothing compared to other places. The atmosphere was nice and the staff was really friendly. I ordered pancakes with seasonal fruit and maple syrup which tasted amazing!!
41,Dignita, 5 stars ,a year ago,I haven‚Äôt been in the restaurant because of covid but I have ordered twice from there and haven‚Äôt been disappointed. The food is amazing ! I‚Äôve tried the ‚Äúchook norris fried chicken sandwich‚Äù and the ‚Äúavo Benny‚Äù and recommend them both.
42,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent food, friendly waiters. Waiting time a bit too long (30+ mins during peak hours on a Sunday) even though food was good. I recommend going early to avoid the lines."
43,Dignita, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Such delicious food, friendly and attentive service, plus brunch all day... What more could you ask for!"
44,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool breakfasts and huge portions. Their salmon royal is really posh. Though one of my eggs was over cooked and a vinegar aftertaste. Tables are too close, I wish there were a bit more privacy."

46,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Top brunch! Plenty of halloumi and bacon üëå
47,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The place is a new concept restaurant style. Wood, plants, huge windows, 3 levels of floors, several options for sitting: chairs, benches, comfortable sofas, long tables facing windows or cosy 2 people chilling corners. It's also perfect ‚Ä¶"

59,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Some of (if not THE) the best brunch ever. Great service and amazing food. I almost want to drive to Amsterdam from Luxembourg just to have their home smoked salmon.
60,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Yes to Dignita every weekend is possible. This place has a small but well curated menu with vegetarian options that are absolutely delicious. It just never disappoints in taste! No reservations are taken and you will probably have to wait a while to finally get to your table.

62,Dignita, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Best brunch I had in months!!!!! Absolutely Delicious, super kind stuff and great relaxing atmosphere!"
63,Dignita, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We went to Dignita for breakfast and had granola and a baked croissant with cheese.

64,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food. But it is very crowdy place.
Be ready to wait 20-30 minutes for table ‚Ä¶"
65,Dignita, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great cafe for breakfast, brunch or lunch! Lots of tables but still always seems to be so packed and popular. So make sure you reserve a table. We ordered our food and after 30-40 minutes it still hadn‚Äôt arrived. The waiter then came to us ‚Ä¶"
66,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best brunch in Amsterdam! Eggs and toast cooked till perfection, and truffled mushrooms are to die for. Too bad no reservations are allowed but if you come after 2:30 the wait is only 10-15 min."
67,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food is really tasty and the whole space is very open with good light. Wifi works very well. Good coffee too. The only tiny thing is that the service could have been a bit more efficient.
68,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,excellent brunch with great presentation! fun atmosphere and friendly staff.
69,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the great brunch venues in amsterdam. very casual, unassuming place with very friendly service and super high-quality food. The menu has a lot of variety. Convenient child's corner with toys as well!"
70,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a chai latte and the umami avocado with gluten free bread. Everything tasted good and the atmosphere was great, the food was just a touch too bland to make it to top grade, but still a very nice caf√©."

74,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I love this place, maybe even my all time favorite place to go. I always love the food, service. Feeling of the space, rain or shine. I feel good eating there and supporting them with the ‚Äúnot for sale‚Äù movement and focus on local products. ‚Ä¶"
75,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Follow my best reviews on Instagram @comfortcomida!

Staff was really nice and I recommend the zucchini chickpea! (I tried the Speculoos Mocha...just tasted like hot chocolate though). The place itself is also beautiful :)"
76,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super friendly staff, fast service and taaaaaasty food presented beautifully. Pancakes were delicious and the soup of the my friend had was also excellent."
77,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A really cool place in the hub of some nice foodie spots.
Good idea to make a reservation as it is popular and can get busy on weekends. The food is well worth it - good portions and delicious.
Definitely one for repeat visits."
78,Dignita, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Very poor customer service, was literally kicked out from the table bcz apparently it was reserved while no sign of reservation was put there.
I think with time they lost their purpose and became a poche, gentrified place.
Pity that capitalism and fake courtesy is all over this place."
79,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We went around midday on a Thursday around 11 AM. There was a few tables left and was delicious every plate that we ordered. Great staff.
80,Dignita, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Food was good. Not the best variety and a little bit too expensive. Atmosphere is nice and cozy.
81,Dignita, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food took an hour after ordering. Smoked salmon, hash browns and poach eggs - how hard can that be? Eggs were overcooked - almost hardboiled. For a place that specializes in brunches, they sure are inefficient. The rest of it was nice but definitely not worth the wait"
82,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The chook Norris was awesome. Kept me going for a lot of time. It's tasty and healthy enough!
83,Dignita, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"This is, by far, the best Brunch place in Amsterdam. Lots of food option to please all cravings. From pancakes to salad and vegetarian dishes to the known as 'brunch' dishes with eggs and avocado. I recommend going out of the rush hour as the waiting list might take more than an hour sometimes."
84,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great atmosphere. I had poached eggs on the crispy hashed potatoes which was very nice.
85,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amber ran the cafe on her own, total legend. More composed than a world champion boxer."
86,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredible food, friendly staff. Perfect sidewalk seating view of the neighborhood."
87,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely, tasty brunch spot with an interesting selection of modern dishes. We got there a bit after 9am on a Sunday, and got a table easily. By the time we finished there was a queue of locals out the door."
88,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great vibe, great food, and great employees. Their English was really good and they were very welcoming."
89,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Just look at these pancakes. They were perfect. Not too heavy, and not too light. Presentation is important as well and as you can see it is like a floral arrangement. Everything in its place."
90,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Love this place! Amazing and delicious breakfast. Lattes pairs up well with any breakfast choices they serve.
91,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food here is great. The poached eggs with salmon and rosti potatoes are just glorious.
Do not miss their other location."
92,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The people are lovely and the food is great. The blueberry pancakes were the best breakfast I have had in Amsterdam. Definitely go out of your way to stop here.

96,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place! Our first stop in Amsterdam, will definitely come back! Great music, excellent food and not at all expensive. Service was friendly and helpful. üòÄ"
97,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the food and the atmosphere so much! Friendly staff as well
98,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had a really great lunch in this place. I chose the Salmon Royal which was quite a delight. I would definitely come back to Amsterdam only to have a proper breakfast here.
99,Dignita, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best Brunch in bed! The pancakes are absolutely amazing, so are the hash brown baskets with their version of eggs benedict, the bacon is crispy but not too salty and whatever the vegan soup is made out of is healthy but soooo flavorful. I ordered Saturday, Sunday and now today!"

111,Dignita, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The food was great, but unfortunately the staff was disappointing. We were with a handicapped person in a wheelchair and we found the guy not sensitive at all to the situation. Shame but he left us with a bad feeling, after that we couldn't enjoy the (again, very good) food."
112,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good coffee and cake. Cozy atmosphere. I wish they also had other dairy alternatives besides soy milk.

137,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a really tasty dish with a mix of mushrooms on bread with perfectly poached eggs. I also really like that there are plenty of tasty vegetarian options! The only downside is that it's often busy, but I suppose that's a sign of it being good."

141,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was amazing, big portions too! Compliments to the chef! We had to wait 45 minutes to get our meal but that was kindly compensated by the waiter. We got two cappuccino for free. She proposed that herself without asking. Very friendly staff. This place is a perfect example to other brunch room!"

143,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great service and great food. Presentation of the pancakes was beautiful
144,Dignita, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Do not bring your laptop to get some work down here. Waiter tried to kick me out even though there were enough empty tables for me to stay. When I asked if I could see her manager she rolled her eyes at me. Very bad vibes indeed.

147,Dignita, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Chook Norris, Pancakes and Forest Dweller were all very delicious. I eat a lot and the Chook Norris was enough by itself for a brunch.

152,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good brunch, inspirational recipes.
They have very good ideas and perfect fusion of middle east - european cuisine. Obviously the recipes are prepared studiously. Menu is well balanced, Staff is kind and have a grasp of their field."
153,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staf, great food although you need to be patient."
154,Dignita, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was pretty decent. The ambience is nice. It's a bit expensive so we expected a bit more. I ordered a Forrest dwellers. It was quite tasty but one of the poached eggs was overcooked. My husband ordered a Benny boy. Fail proof, not. ‚Ä¶"
155,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The interior is nicely decorated and there are places to sit outside. It was very busy when we went there and there was a waiting of around 20 minutes, which we had expected. ‚Ä¶"
156,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is special. We loved it so much we came 3 times during our 3 night stay in Amsterdam. Consistently amazing, if I could give it 6 stars I would. Staff are super friendly, the coffee is faultless and the food is delicious. An absolute treat, this place clearly deserves all the 5 star reviews it gets."
157,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great brunch spot in nice area of Amsterdam!
158,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"i loved their freshly made drinks, especially the green one, and menu always looked very exciting and promising, great ingrediants and seasonal offers. but all three times we had a meal there it was always a bit disappointing flavour-wise. everything was ok but a bit tasteless."
159,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food and service. Very convenient next to the tram and close to the park.
160,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 months ago,All very good and nice though not extraordinery
161,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Yes, if you arrive in the weekend expect some waiting time both to get a table and sometimes to get your food (though, I have always find it pretty reasonable). If you are in a hurry, don't go there.. but if you have some time and are ‚Ä¶"
162,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pancakes were so good! Highly recommend.
163,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I was bothered this place might be overhyped in travel guides and when I arrived my concerns were not allayed as the menu reminded me of a few brunch caf√©s back in England with a similar (or perhaps slightly higher) price tag. BUT! ‚Ä¶
164,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cute, great food (the strawberry lavender almond pancakes were wonderful). Nice staff. The only reason it's not 5 stars is the amount you pay for coffee and how little you get. Though their chai latte is like a hug in a cup."
165,Dignita, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Charming and well located brunch place. The food was absolutely sublime and the staff very friendly.

169,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ate brunch at this restaurant, was incredible.  There are many vegetarian and vegan options if you're into that.  I chose the Benny-Boy with bacon. yummmm.  Also, staff seemed to really enjoy their job and everyone was smiling.  I would definitely go back and recommend this place to others. Thanks!"
170,Dignita, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is super tasty. Just really a shame that it takes them an hour to get it out of the kitchen every time. Do not recommend if you have things to do. Otherwise, great place for brunch in Amsterdam."
171,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love this cafe. Have reserved for large parties and just turned up hoping for a table-all times staff have been exceptionally helpful. Lovely atmosohere and great food. Excellent brunch menu and lovely drinks. Good for kids but best for a bunch of buddies looking for a chat over a yummy brunch
172,Dignita, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious food, friendly stuff + kids play corner"
173,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ohh what a yummy brunch here! Prepare for the somewhat long wait, but well worth it. We had the Mushroom Forrest - Sandwich with grilled mushrooms and poached eggs and Salmon Royale. Both were outstanding! Also we each got a pot of tea, which was 6 cups! Good food, reasonable price and a bit of wait."
174,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice breakfast place with sincerely excellent coffee and great menu. Nicely decorated off the beaten path but with a tramstop out front so easily accessible from the city or elsewhere. Swamped by tourists on the weekend with people crowding the sidewalk.
175,Dignita, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Super disappointed! From the mouthful that I managed to have after waiting for tables and then food for over an hour, the food is actually pretty good. What ruins this place is the service and the staff attitude.  My and my child's order ‚Ä¶"
176,Dignita, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Best brunch in town. Is not just the cozy atmosphere, friendly service, amazing and tasty variety of dishes and dessert, but it also has a nice social purpose. So, as they say. ""Eat well do good"" (or the other way around I don't remember). Not cheap but the service and food totally worth it"
177,Dignita, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"One of best places for brunch in Amsterdam. Very consistent in terms of quality and taste. . I love the forest dwellers. Good cappuccino. Animal friendly, casual and with special space for children. No need for reservation. Sometimes there is a little waiting line. Sunny tables outside."
178,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The perfect Brunch/lunch spot in Amsterdam! They have great coffee and an even greater menu. Where other brunch spots might offer all the standard stuff, these guys have a menu that will blow your mind!"
179,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"After 15 minutes waiting, we tried  THE best breakfast place next to Vondelpark. Very friendly and efficient staff, tasty fresh juices, nice pancakes and a variety of fruits/yoghurt/granola style bowls and super cappuccino! If you re not in a rush, take the time to go."
180,Dignita, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We were very excited to try the food here so we waited 30 minutes just to be seated. Unfortunately our experience wasn‚Äôt as excellent as we would‚Äôve liked. We waited 45 minutes for our food and had to nudge the waitress to ask where our ‚Ä¶
181,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The quality of the food here is very high. The staff looks a bit overworked and busy during lunch and there is often a wait - even on weekdays.  The cauliflower soup was so tasty - not something I say often about anything cauliflower.
182,Dignita, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Really great experience. The food is very tasty and the coffee is strong and delicious. The space is airy and bright and even the crockery is beautiful. We've been back again and both times it was a great experience. The poached eggs are done perfectly!!
183,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful place with super delicious food...I had the feta and wild greens pastry for breakfast and it was great. Staff were lovely. Perfect for our business meeting !
184,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Dignita is your go-to caf√© in Amsterdam. You can enjoy breakfast, brunch or lunch in the heart of Amsterdam Zuid. I've definitely eat well at this place, I can tell you, this was the most fresh and well prepared brunch I've ever had so ‚Ä¶"
185,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic place. Light, bright and full of delicious food. Generous portions, exciting and varied menu. Friendly and helpful staff, even when rushed off their feet. Appreciated the little touches of free water and letting us sit and chat rather than chasing us out as soon as we were done. Accepts credit card."
186,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Overall positive experience. Good food but relatively highly priced. The staff were very friendly and helpful - they accidentally took the wrong order and offered a discount on the total bill to make up for this mistake. Christmas ‚Ä¶
187,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Couldn't fault it! 10/10 everything was amazing! The pancakes were to die for! Up there with the best pancakes I've ever had! And the smoothies are amazing too! A must go for breakfast! Can't rate it more!
188,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Brunch is a crowded, competitive and over-hyped thing in Amsterdam that can drive a free thinker like myself nuts. However, Dignita navigates the hipster waters in a fairly acceptable manner. Food is very good though priced according to ‚Ä¶"
189,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy place, excellent staff, friendly with groups and laptoppers alike. One of my favorites in Amsterdam."
190,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Best place in Town for brunch! The eggs are poached beautifully and there are always some vegan options available. Only downside is their popularity, need to be prepared to wait :p"
191,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"For sure one of the best places for having brunch in Amsterdam. Delicious food, nice atmosphere and very friendly waiters. Top quality. And you have to try the Pancakes, they are amazing! I always add bacon and I feel like being in heaven. ‚Ä¶"
192,Dignita, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Super! Had an amazing dish of chickpea patties, with a mint sauce, avocado, haloumi cheese and a poached egg with grated peanuts. Great service as well!"
193,Dignita, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This place got worse over the time. it served delicious brunch two years ago but now it does not worth a visit. Portions became 30% smaller, hashbrown was overfried and poached egg was overcooked. Service is unattentive."
194,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Favorite brunch place! Try the Benny Boy or Forest Dwellers, both very yummy egg dishes.. Also suitable for families with kids. Expect long wait time if you arrive between 10am and noon..."
195,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Everything is perfect from the names of the meals, forest dweller and Benny-boy, to the food itself. Very crowded for brunch on a Sunday so you may have to wait but it will be worth it! ‚Ä¶"
196,Dignita, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Guys, please do not be fooled by good reviews, It's a regular place with regular(not bad though) food and very unorganized.The waiting time at the door for one hour (promised 25-30 min)  does not worth the food  received after the order. ‚Ä¶"
197,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Go-to brunch in AMS.
White label coffees are well prepared, punchy cocktails will get you in the mood for the delicious & well seasoned dishes. Cakes are in point too. By the city's standards: reasonably priced and great service."
198,Dignita, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice breakfast! The forrest dweller is my favorite dish!
199,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The most lovely place in the neighborhood for a brilliant bit of food or a cuppa or a slice of something sweet. I highly recommend the crumpets, and well, everything else, really. The only thing I haven't tried is the dish with all the mushrooms."
200,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best brunches in town; charming location, some amazing (and chic!) dishes. And the staff was very friendly too. Definitely recommend for those lookin for a good (boozy) brunch when in Amsterdam!"
201,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really sweet service, with a beautiful selection of brunch food available from morning to afternoon. The food and coffee is very good, and the setting is comfortable. Great spot!"
202,Dignita, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We had breakfast there during our 3 day trip to Amsterdam and it was delicious. Unfortunately they didn't serve the 'dutch and delicious' after 11am anymore (although it was literally 10:58) which we would have liked to have. Also 9‚Ç¨ for scrambled eggs with bacon is a little steep if you ask me.
203,Dignita, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Total disaster. We read all the negative reviews and still decided to give it a try, since the place is really close to where we live. What a disappointment!  Completely disorganized, and this is just a beginning; waited for over 45 minutes ‚Ä¶"
204,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cool place. The tables can be a bit too next to each other to my liking and it gets very busy. The salad didn't include seasoning of any kind. The employees were very nice.
205,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious drinks (chai latte and fresh oj were exquisite). Tasty, creative food. Friendly, attentive service. Very friendly service. Great atmosphere (the vibe is creative and welcoming). Would come back to eat, drink, read, anything!"
206,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm so happy that Dignita is not in the city center, because it would be impossible to get a spot at this delicious brunch restaurant. All of their dishes are amazing - I keep coming back for a Forest Dwellers or Eggs Royale breakfast. Very good value for money. Worth the wait if there's a line."
207,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing brunch! Everything was delicious, from the coffee to the juices and of course the food! Super busy though on the weekend so make sure to come early"
208,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely cafe (not 'coffeeshop') in the Vondelpark part of Amsterdam, lively with friendly service and great coffee. A slight wait for eat in services but food was fantastic and coffee even better, take away coffees were fast and payment was ‚Ä¶"
209,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic brunch!! Healthy and delicious. I‚Äôve had better coffee, but that‚Äôs ok. Our server wasn‚Äôt the best, but overall great pick!!"
210,Dignita, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is amazing but service was bad: no hello from our waiter, took us 45 minutes to get our food. We were there on a weekend though, this might explain things. Guys, it's ok to stop accepting customers because it's overcrowded!"
211,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best brunch place in Amsterdam! Excellent service.. really delicious food.. lots of options to cater for gluten free, vegan etc! Yummy variation of cosy egg dishes. Atmosphere of the place is great, could spend all day here sipping on my chia and tasting the gluten free cakes üòã also child/baby friendly! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
212,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Brunch spot on my doorstop that has a fantastic menu of delicious treats. Vegan options EXCELLENT! Worth a visit or 60 ‚ù§ try the Benny Boy! You won't regret it.
213,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best brunch food in Amsterdam but tends to be super crowded. Stay-at-home moms with excessively large prams particularly love this place. However service is always quick and friendly, never disappoints!"
214,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the smoked salmon with poached eggs on the hashbrown and the goddess green bowl... Both of them were fantastic for our bellies, just like the large cappuccino and latte. Dankje!"
215,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Amazing concept and food! One of those neighbors you really like a lot and continuously go back to! Lots of favorites from the menu but I fell in love with the avocado side with feta and pomegranate.
216,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favourite place in Amsterdam for breakfast, very good eggs benedict. The atmosphere is also nice. However, it gets crowded and you might have to wait in a queue for a while."
217,Dignita, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very poor customer service. Sat us (party of 3) at one table and after taking our drinks order moved us to a 2 person table (added a chair in front  of the toilet to make it fit 3). The explanation was that they needed to make space for a party of 5. Made us feel like second class customers.
218,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent place to have Breakfast, Brunch, Lunch or an afternoon snack..

220,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Top noch service and friendly staff, really nice enteriuor, awesome menu... HOWEVER, taste was a bit underwhelming. I had poached eggs with mushrooms, and it was a bit meh. Cherry cake was amazing, I have to say."
221,Dignita, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Our preferred brunch place in Amsterdam, they also make lovely cakes."
222,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favorite places in Amsterdam! Even if you have to queue a bit during the weekend, it's all worth it. Great food, very nice service and good vibes. We will always come back."
223,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely loved it. Food and coffee were delicious. I would like to also try their second place as well as there is a garden where they grow their own vegetables apparently.
Very nice staff and environment."
224,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The place is always busy but it's worth the wait. The food was very tasty and there is enough variety in the brunch plates for vegetarian or vegan. Loved it!
225,Dignita, 5 stars ,8 months ago,One of the best brunch places in Amsterdam. The Benny Boy is delicious
226,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We had really good brunch here on the first day of our holiday. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Only downside is the toilets are down a steep set of stairs
227,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Breakfast with healthy and tasty options, personnel polite, gentle and friendly. Place doesn't become packed although it was quite busy. You cannot book during the weekends though, so expect some queuing during lunch time - 12pm to 13pm. ‚Ä¶"
228,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great brunch offer. Place is cozy and kids friendly. It gets very busy on Sunday mornings so my advice is go at 10:00 to get a table and try to sit far from the entrance. ;)
229,Dignita, 1 star ,5 months ago,Did not let me in with a UK vaccine certificate. Ridiculous
230,Dignita, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Amazing food and large portions at very reasonable prices with wonderful and warm service to match. Everyone in my group enjoyed the experience very much! We also visited their retail store further north which also had very friendly service staff.
231,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for breakfast. The forest mushroom mix was amazing. The mushrooms is Amsterdam are varied and delicious and not enough places make the most of them.
232,Dignita, 1 star ,4 years ago,"In Dignita, my friends and I had a truly bad experience. The dishes were disappointingly small, the waitress kept on dropping things, we didn‚Äôt get the food listed on the menu, and so the list goes on. ‚Ä¶"
233,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty and healthy food, also great coffee! It was quite busy when we visited, but that just goes to show how great their products are."
234,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you wanna have decent breakfast with a reasonable price, this place is the best. They have good coffee, nice atmosphere, and very good breakfast. Try forest dwellers and eggs your way in the menu."
235,Dignita, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best brunch I've ever had. Not just in the Netherlands. It's really fantastic. Worth the queue time, and worth its very reasonable price."
236,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,If I could I would give it some more stars. What an awesome place to have a breakfast or brunch. Just remember to be there on time since it's small but very very popular so you could have to wait a lot. Buf the food is just awesome.
237,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Homemade coconut yogurt and granola was heavenly.
238,Dignita, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful place to have a breakfast, do some work or simply chat with friends. Food is okay for me but was a bit overcooked: bacon was barely edible and merengues were burned."
239,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent food and coffee. Tried many dishes, which all had one or more exquisite details in both taste and display. They also serve both vegan, dairy- and glutenfree meals and coffee."
240,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Took ages for us to get a table, and with good reason, the coffee was good and the food was amazing. Haven‚Äôt had brunch like that for ages. And the service was good too."

243,Dignita, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great place for all day brunch. Their motto is: Eat well do good. All profits go to charity.
244,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best breakfast place in Amsterdam. This location is child-friendly with the small play-corner downstairs. The one on the backyard of Hermiatage is absolutely georgous especially when the weather is good. Food is great in both of them!
245,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this place! Excellent food, corner for kids (HOORAY), ok vibe (I just don't like this stuck up neighbourhood). The food is flavourfull, creative and not overpriced. Service is ok aka the Dutch way. I like that they have meat, vegetarian and vegan dishes too."

Gluten-free bread and alter milks are available."

248,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We found this place through scrolling on Instagram, it really didn‚Äôt disappoint! I can‚Äôt remember the last time I reviewed a place online but felt this was necessary. Exteremly good quality food and great portion sizes. Will definitely recommend!"
249,Dignita, 2 stars ,2 years ago,First they lost the waiting list we were on (so we waited 2 rounds to get a table). Then they didn‚Äôt register what we ordered (so we waited one hour to get the food). Finally got some drinks from the house and the food was good. Too bad this bad organisation for our first experience
250,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing! Best lunch place!
251,Dignita, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Always amazing, the Eggs benny with smoked salmon are delious  one of my favorite places for brunch."

254,Dignita, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We used to go there , as the food is good. The service is always busy, and it takes a lot of time to get your meal.
But today, they refused to heat up our son's food, as they were too busy. We'll never go back."
255,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Been here a few times now and the service and various dishes (and cakes!) have always been fantastic. Best brunch I've had in Amsterdam
256,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious brunch in a nice place
257,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Our Host recomended this place and we couldn't be happier. We went there on  Saturday and it was so busy that the staff took our name and asked us to come back 20 min later. After this period of time we went there and there was already a table waiting for us. The food quality couldn't be better. Those20 min were worthy.
258,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My son says they have the best food ever!!!! He loved the Benny Boy.
Highly recommend anything on the menu it‚Äôs always so tasty and filling and perfect service and cost atmosphere."
259,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely brunch and a cheesecake to die for!
260,Dignita, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Awful service, they don‚Äôt pay attention to their customers. I was alone and without a reservation, when I arrived they told me they had a table available only for 45min, it took them 15 min to take my order, and about 30 min to bring the food. Never going back."
261,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Vegan salad was out of this world!! Creative dishes, healthy, perfect portions and friendly staff and fast service. Highly recommend this cafe!"
262,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This has to be my favorite breakfast place in Amsterdam. It's not overhyped and the food is INCREDIBLE. Get the eggs Benedict and a flat white - you won't regret it. Lovely space too!

271,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best cafe ever!! Amazing cakes and very tasty brunch. The atmosphere is wonderful. I'd come back to Amsterdam just for itüíû
272,Dignita, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for brunch. Downside is that everyone else feels the same so it gets a bit crowded and noisy. Still worth the trip, though."
273,Dignita, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Beautifully prepared and very tasty meal. Very light and open environment. A lovely place to have a Sunday Brunch!
274,Dignita, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"This used to be my favorite place when it just started & they were working with real challenged staff (social, psychological, physical). Now the service seems to be about checking whether i can or will pay for the food; the constant checking is very uncomfortable & rude. And seemingly only the non-white? In Amsterdam?"
275,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love everything about this place. Food, atmosphere, service... everything perfect."
276,Dignita, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favorite brunch places in Amsterdam. Benny Boy and Forest Dwellers are totally recommended. Espresso is truly one of the best in town!

284,Dignita, 1 star ,4 years ago,"After having read countless positive reviews about Dignita‚Äôs buzzing atmosphere, fresh organic food and excellent service, my family and I were looking very much forward to trying the - what we thought to be - hippest place in the ‚Ä¶"

287,Dignita, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful food and coffee. This is a real treat to have in the neighborhood. Go to their site a read up on some of the work they do in regards to human trafficking.
