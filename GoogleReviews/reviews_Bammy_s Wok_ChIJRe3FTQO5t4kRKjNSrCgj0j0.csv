2,Bammy's Wok, 1 star ,2 months ago,This place is for people who don’t like seasoning we visited here my family & I true authentic Jamaicans. We ordered curry goat & it tasted like LAMB Def a NO NO. The fish was pretty good. The chef then told us Americans do not like spicy …
3,Bammy's Wok, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Beautiful spot along the water. The staff were friendly and the drinks are good. We tried their fish, bammys, plantain, macaroni pie, curry shrimp, and conch fritters. I wouldn't do the macaroni pie again but everything else was ok. Not …"
4,Bammy's Wok, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Big chunes playing in this place. Pain killers is the best drink. Conch fritters were tasty. The jerk wing sauce was on the side. I would preferred it on the wings. …
5,Bammy's Wok, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"We had the mac pie, half jerk chicken, curry goat, plantains and a few drinks. While the jerk chicken was crispy on the exterior and moist on the interior, it could have been basted with more jerk to a create a balanced flavor. The curry …"
6,Bammy's Wok, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Two stars for the goat. Four stars for the jerk chicken. Goat was worst I have ever tasted. No flavor. Over cooked. Bleh! Slushy machine that makes the Pina Colada should be thoroughly cleaned. It and a nasty taste to it. Plantains and Mac and cheese were great!
7,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The pepper shrimp was awesome Make sure you can handle the heat though. The mac and cheese and plantains and jerk wings were also very good. If you have a opportunity sit outside for the ambiance at the water.
8,Bammy's Wok, 4 stars ,a week ago,"Been here twice & the jerk chicken meal was good. The food comes in large portions for a good price, the second time I went I had the curry goat meal, that meal was not all that I’m not sure what ingredients they use but curry is yellow not …"
9,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Great spot for Caribbean eats! I tried bammy for the first time and loved it! The conch fritters tasted like the ones I had while in the Bahamas. I will most definitely be back to enjoy more items from their menu!
10,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"A taste of the islands away from the island. The food was wonderful. I had the pork belly, collards and plantains. The pina colada strawberry swirl was great and refreshing on a 90° day. The view is also spectacular."
11,Bammy's Wok, 1 star ,2 months ago,Food was not good! Owner is a liar. Serving lamb and saying it’s goat. Would never come back. Also general manager with man bun is very rude . …
12,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Listen… Bammys was so good that I didn’t get to take a picture of my food! They staff are super cool and the music definitely gives you the vibes of being in the Caribbean! To add to it, it right on the water at the Navy Yard! The food was …"
13,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"So bomb! The jerk was real good, the steamed fish was nice and spicy and just one pina colada/daiquiri blend with a float had us tipsy."
14,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,The best Jamaican food I’ve had since living in the US. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was great!! Food portion are huge and the customer service from the staff and chief/owner was wonderful. I will be back!! Definitely recommend!!
15,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,a year ago,Wow what a lovely spot right on the waterfront! We were actually originally at aqua 301 next door and noticed people weren't finishing their meals and the drinks were limited to tequila....so....we wandered over to bammy's next door since …

17,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"While I have been to small restaurants that offer their own take on Jamaican food, I was glad to have a more upscale experience at Bammy’s. I’d highly recommend the pimento fried chicken, spicy cheese, and goat curry. The drinks were also …"

19,Bammy's Wok, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"Bammys has a super fun, laid back atmosphere. Authentic Caribbean dishes and great late night drinks and bites. We loved the pimento cheese dip with rolls. The sauce with the fried chicken was awesome, giving 4 stars because the chicken is …"
20,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great selection of authentic Jamaican food, especially for those homesick Yardies. The chef is from Jamaica and knows his stuff! Couldnt reccomend this place more"
21,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,a month ago,Came to Bammy’s right when it opened in 2020 and was unimpressed. Since then they have seriously upped their game. Have been once for dine-in and just got takeout for restaurant week. Jerk chicken and fried chicken are on point and the Chana is great. A must visit when in navy yard.
22,Bammy's Wok, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"Unfortunately, my visit to this establishment began with a bad taste in my mouth. Upon entering, there was a couple who were 30 mins late for their reservations. Due to their tardiness, their table was given to someone else. My friend …"
23,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was delicious and lots of options. My favorite dish was probably the Mac and cheese type dish, and the chana (chickpea dish). We ordered a lot of different sides and starters and shared as opposed to just going with three entrees. …"
24,Bammy's Wok, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Ordered the roasted fish - nice flavor but obviously cooked from frozen and the fish was undercooked when it first came out. The staff was nice and the atmosphere was pleasant, but I don’t recommend the fish here. The sides they gave as an apology were tasty at least and other dishes seemed to be better received."
25,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This place is amazing. We ordered the Fritters, Pepper Shrimp, Mac and Cheese, Shrimp Curry and the Pork Belly. Everything was impeccable...I can't stress that enough. …"
26,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Such a fun addition to the neighborhood. Love the outdoor seating when the weather is nice. The curry dishes are amazing and the rum punch…. Chefs kiss!!!
27,Bammy's Wok, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Heard about the restaurant on Fox5DC, so we checked it out.  The view of the navy yard was a great plus and the curry goat tasted good (but the entree is a starter size) and my 10-year-old son like the macaroni pie. Nothing else was good. …"
28,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Was in town from the tri-state checking out places to eat.  My husband found Bammy's and suggested that we check it out.  Me: Do we really want to come to DC to eat more Caribbean food? But I played along.  The area was pretty nice and …

30,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food was delicious. Very well made and flavourful. The fish, the chicken, the goat, the drinks all tastes great."
31,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Curry goat and escovitch were some of the best I’ve ever had! Run don’t walk to this place. Service was top-notch as well. Feels like everyone there really takes pride in serving the best Caribbean food in the city.
32,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"This place is wonderful! Everything is flavorful and cooked to perfection. The menu is shot, simple, and delicious! Thank you Chef Chris for a thoughtful dining experience! I’ll be returning soon."

35,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Absolutely wonderful from start to finish. Had a horrible experience at a place a few blocks away, and was so glad Bammys was on my list. Everyone was wonderful, professional, and the meal and service were top notch. I can't recommend more. …"
36,Bammy's Wok, 4 stars ,10 months ago,This place exceeded my expectations! I'm Jamaican so Caribbean food is dear to me. This restaurant really captures the essence of our cuisine. I knew this place understood Caribbean cuisine when I saw they had a chow mein on the menu. Only …
37,Bammy's Wok, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"The customer service, music, drinks (especially the pina colada), rice and peas were great! The 1/2 jerk chicken was okay, I’ll try the wings next time. The cabbage was a bit too spicy for my liking but still good."
38,Bammy's Wok, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Tucked away in Navy Yard along the Anacostia River is a Caribbean restaurant with indoor seating and a large outdoor patio near Yards Park. Here's my experience: …

44,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"The food was tasty, but the service was excellent. They had many table touches, and we're personable- the bartender came over and sat with us a bit before it got busy. Great atmosphere! Would have been outside if it wasn't raining so hard"
45,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,2 months ago,It is amazing! The customer service is amazing and the food is even better everything on the menu is delicious especially the conc fritters and pimento fried chicken
46,Bammy's Wok, 1 star ,10 months ago,Tried this place yesterday and it was NOT amazing. The food was not authentic at all. Flavoring was way off on top of the fact that the spice was so strong you couldn’t enjoy the food. Cocoa bread was not the real thing at all it was just dinner rolls being passed off as cocoa bread. The were the best thing just not strong.
47,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Nice reggea vibes everything we had was on point. Good food!
48,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,a year ago,Came for impromptu drinks. The staff was so accommodating to seating us even though we didn’t have reservations. We ordered the swirl Miami Vices which were amazing. Our waitress was very attentive and personable. The owner even came over …

Personally I wouldn’t order delivery from here again. Overly priced Jamaican …"
52,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had the best time at Bammy's! We sat outside and ordered so much food, we were super full when we left. I highly suggest the curry, the festivales, and both the chicken and the pimento appetizers. The cocktails were amazing and the rum …"

54,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,8 months ago,This restaurant came highly recommended from friends of ours and it did not disappoint! We really enjoyed the laid back vibe and the attentiveness of the staff. I ordered the 1/2 jerk chicken and hubby had the curry shrimp. Both dishes were …
55,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"The food was good.. the drinks are tasty, and the service was decent. Definitely a revisit. You need to try the jerk wings and the fried conch was the best I ever tasted.. 5 stars on food, 4 on service...  drinks 10 🌟"

58,Bammy's Wok, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Great portion size, good price, poor execution.
Although it's Caribbean inspired it's definitely not Caribbean. The macaroni pie was way too spicy, to the point that I could not finish it and I actually enjoy …"
59,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I was just there and the food is out of this world. The jerk wing will gladly fill you with jamacain love. Soo flavor. The crew and managers are so helpful. I will he back for the fish again. 👍🏽
60,Bammy's Wok, 1 star ,5 months ago,"No comment, you wouldn’t believe me even if I tried! I only recommend this place if you’re not really hungry, because the wait for my food was ridiculous! But it was good."
61,Bammy's Wok, 2 stars ,a year ago,Gentrified Jamaican food. Everything was bland and was not cooked with love. The curry goat was tough and tasted like pot roast. Nothing tasted how it should've. This is definitely for white tourists who know nothing.
62,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"save yourself the trip to the Caribbean, the food and drinks are better than anything i tried when i was down there.  Definitely recommend the rum punch and the conch fritters(I'm not even a fan of conch fritters and these were delicious)!"

67,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Gerald and Chris are STILL AT IT, perfectly recreating a cuisine that we have little exposure to in DC. I grew up eating jerk chicken and curry goat and these dishes will not disappoint. Ask all the questions from the knowledgeable chefs, order all the drinks from the most-fun bartender, and get the conch fritters (you're welcome)!"
68,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice chill spot. Had some wings and a few beers.  The pork belly is must and Staff was very nice.
69,Bammy's Wok, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Grabbed take-out and took it home (roughly 25 minutes) -- the food was fantastic. We ordered the chicken, two curries, and a handful of the sides.

Drinks were also pretty good. Got the coloring book, rum punch, and mix up. Mix up is a little sweet tho"
85,Bammy's Wok, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"VERY poor and slow service. Sat for 20 minutes with no waiter. Food was slow, took 25 minutes to get wings. The wings were good, but that was the only good thing about my visit."
