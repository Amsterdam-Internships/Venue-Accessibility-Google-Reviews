4,Oedipus Brewing, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Staff were friendly but the first round of beer already took a while and our waiter informed us of a long wait for food. But at least once the food comes it should be hot, however we got cold fries after 1 hour. The burgers were not much ‚Ä¶"
5,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing little gem. Worth a visit and their beer selection was phenomenal üëå
6,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great vibe, excellent home-brewed beers, and they share the venue with the best burger place in Amsterdam, so doesn't get any better.
Staff was a bit overwhelmed (on a busy Sunday evening) so our drinks took a while, but still they were very friendly and reacted quickly when we asked about them again."
7,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,8 months ago,A nice spot for some craft beers and yummy food. Altogether was a nice experience with a group of friends.
8,Oedipus Brewing, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Nice beers if enough patience you‚Äôve got. However, the burgers will take longer than an hour, be ready for that, and be ready for ‚Äòno sorry‚Äô for any mistake of the staff. Moreover, the staff might inform you that they forgot about some ‚Ä¶"
9,Oedipus Brewing, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"The beers are really nice, no doubt about that, but the service is awful. Understaffed or not, there is no excuse for being impolite, nor much excuse either for taking half an hour to take a simple order of three plain drinks, then even ‚Ä¶"
10,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's definitely worth heading over the river to visit Oedipus if you can. It feels a little bit out of the way but do go. There is a good selection of beers on tap (and bottled). They serve really good burgers and have a range of snacks ‚Ä¶
11,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty beer üç∫ especially IPA & Pilsner üëåüëå they do the best burgers in town and the interior is very cosy & unique.

15,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing beers and friendly service. The Beef Chief burgers are a perfect addition to the beers. Pias Tropical is a seasonal selection and my personal favorite. Very cool warehouse setting.
16,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing range of experimental and classic beers, really cool venue and friendly staff. Definitely pop in and try something new!"
17,Oedipus Brewing, 1 star ,6 months ago,Two of our order didn't come on time we waited for at least 1 hour and still received a very bad treatment without any apologise. Staff and the manager was very rude to us. Worst experience I had in a burger place in NL
18,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there for a tasting in a group of 6, really cool, laid back environment. One of the owners gave us a tour in the brewery and told us a lot about their history. Really nice beers, very unique experience"
19,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,2 years ago,There was a good selection of beers and they all came in fun colourful glasses. We visited mid-afternoon on a Saturday and there was a good atmosphere without being too busy. The decor was bright and cheerful and we enjoyed our beverages.

27,Oedipus Brewing, 1 star ,6 months ago,Food is ok but the staff was very rude. I would never come again. They failed to mention that they didn't have ingredients to make my burger. All my friends ate and I waited 1 hour more for my order. The staff didn't even apologize for that.
28,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beer tasted fine and the place is very hipster, which might be appealing for a lot of people. They got some interesting beer choices, if you are into small brewery definitely check this out."

30,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome brewery with a fantastic atmosphere. Highlight of the day in Amsterdam - easily whiled away a few hours here, sitting in the sun and drinking some damn fine brews. Kinda compares to Beavertown/Pressure Drop in London."

35,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love this alternative place in the North of Amsterdam. Spacecious brewery where it's nice to chill outside if the weather allows it of course! The special beers all have their funky etiquettes and are mostly served from tap. Good selection of tasteful beers!
36,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool warehouse brewery with outdoor seating. Interesting artwork, awesome staff, great selection of beers. Ocasional events"
37,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is great! I love their beers, branding looks amazing, space is huge and the vibe is something not to be missed while being in Amsterdam! Definetely coming back once I‚Äôm again in Amsterdam! Aha, and the burgers are quite tasty üëçüèª"

39,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious beer and food! Bit pricy but worth a visit. Quite crowded on the weekends. Must visit for beer fans!
40,Oedipus Brewing, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"When the kitchen decides to close 10 mins earlier, they should inform the staff so that the waiters avoid the embarrassment of canceling the orders. However, good beer and coasters."

44,Oedipus Brewing, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Original design and identity, full marks for that. Bar staff vary from too cool to talk to really nice and friendly. Unconventional beer names and bright coloured spaces create a hip post kitchvibe. Been here many times because friends love ‚Ä¶"

46,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great micro brewery with passionate staff and great beer. We took the brewery tour at 15 on a Sunday and enjoyed it a lot.
47,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's an industrial feel brew pub that offers a wide variety of delicious beers, both more classic and different (in a good way). As of writing (Feb 20) they were relocating the kitchen which made the food choice more limited, however the ‚Ä¶"
48,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great selection of craft beers with burgers from Beef Chief (Straight to Hell was my choice, no regrets) to complement those. It's located in an industrial space with cool vibe and colours. Can definitely recommend to make a trip over the river for this."

55,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice discovery in the outskirts of Amsterdam: good + original beers and burgers!
56,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I am a wine drinker, but when we went here and had a chat with one of the managers here, they said - ppl who say that are not a beer drinker, just haven found the beer for them. On top of that, learning how they integrate all these ‚Ä¶"
57,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"People might overlook this amazing brewery in North Amsterdam, writing it off because it is out of the way. DON‚ÄôT DO IT! The craft beer is delicious, the staff is extremely friendly and the surrounds in the brewery comfortable and ‚Ä¶"
58,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Americans (and craft brew lovers) take note - this is the kind of place you are used too. Several sour options, as well as others, that taste excellent. Plus good food and a lively atmosphere. Well worth the subway ride over the canal. By far my favorite in Amsterdam. I hope to be back to try more of these brews!"
59,Oedipus Brewing, 1 star ,a year ago,"Living in the neighbourhood, we walked to the recently openend Oedipus bar at Javaplein in Amsterdam Oost. When we arrived, we were asked to wait as a table for three didn't open up yet. No problem, because we were keen to check the new bar ‚Ä¶"
60,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place with tasty beers, great burgers (courtesy of the Beef Chief) and a wonderful vibe. Also been to a few of the special events which attract a great crowd. ‚Ä¶"
61,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely a rowdier brewery but we had a blast! Cool decor, marketing, music, and ambiance. Expect a hybrid between a club and a brewery. The beer selection was also really good!"
62,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really cool vibe - awesome staff,  interesting selection of beers, tasty burgers and fries and some fun events! Check it out!"
63,Oedipus Brewing, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Beer is okay, service isn't. Got there at 8 o'clock, ordered beer. Went to the table, looked at the menu, tried to order food... Kitchen closed since 8 o'clock. Sorry guys, but if you serve new customers at 8 o'clock, either ask them if ‚Ä¶"
64,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Pure brilliance. We took to the time to head out here and we weren't disappointed. Colourful tap room with excellent outdoor space (paddling pool, fairly lights, palm trees). Friendly atmosphere and helpful staff - the food was good too. The beers.....well that goes without saying (but I will): Fantastic as expected from Oedipus"
65,Oedipus Brewing, 1 star ,2 years ago,Two Years ago one one my fav burger places in Amsterdam. Sadly it totally turned bad. Burger was cold and after complaints they redid it and served it cold again. also quality went worse and greasy. for 50 euros its absolutely bold to serve ‚Ä¶
66,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great beer and a cozy, relaxed environment inside an industrial building. Had some amazing burgers and regrouped before moving on. Would definitely return. This place is worth the ferry ride/walk over to North Amsterdam."
67,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Exactly what you would expect, younger crowd no one here was above 30.  It's similar to what you think of when a teenager sets up a garage for a party, but there's delicious beer on tap, and huge brewing vats in the background. Came a bit ‚Ä¶"
68,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent variety of beer, brewery is on premises. Friendly owner, unique setup, colorful and cheerful ambience with good music. More than 10 beers fresh on tap and a lot more in the bottle menu. Its a hidden gem of Amsterdam."
69,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's something you will not find in the city. Exciting new beers englobed by a modern/crazy concept. Best option to get a break from the city life and enjoy a good time with friends. I highly require the brewery to stay like this and not transform into a touristic overcrowded place.:)
Thanks."
70,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Selection of beers in this brewery has a sense of humor, but flavor wise they're great. The brewery tour could've been better organized as it was too loud to hear the guide properly. A microphone would be helpful, or to stand in a more quiet area of the brewery."
71,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"One of the upcoming breweries in the city. Very tasty beers and you can also see the factory and tanks, so very nice specially for beer freaks. These aren't main factors, but sofas were very comfortable too and there is free wifi. ‚Ä¶"
72,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fun brew pub north of city center. Easy walk from the metro. A variety of beers on tap. Fries were piping hot and delicious (if a bit stubby)
73,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great little brewery the beers here are quite unique. I tried about 5 of them and they were delicious. Prices are well worth it. The beers are about 8%, so 5 was enough. Staff are very cool."
74,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,First day of summer. Glad I finally visited. Great atmosphere and a beer selection to be proud of.
75,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good draft beer, a lot of recipes and flavours. Fries and burgers are fantastic. Very good prices but the service is not the best - worth going anyways. Cheerful crowd, young and fun place to have drinks and eat."
76,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A must visit for craft beer fans. Wide selection of beers and food is quite good too! This place can be quite busy on weekends and in sunny weather, but no problem - that only adds up to the good vibe! :)"
77,Oedipus Brewing, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"For drinks Oedipus is great. They know how to brew for sure. The concept is from the heart, you can tell that once you get into their bar. So yes, their beer is good and special. But.... The food is not nice. Our burger was (too) raw, the ‚Ä¶"
78,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great selection of beers. Very relaxed and also decent food
79,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great little brewery. The venue is an open warehouse style building that houses the brewing facilities too. A nice selection of 10 or so Oedipus beers. Good for groups, not good for non-beer drinkers."
80,Oedipus Brewing, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Beer is unusual and place looks cool, but portions of food are very small, we waited for our order for an hour, beer costs 10 eur"
81,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Small brewery just slightly out of the city center. This place has amazing beers brewed by passionate people. Definitely worth the visit if you're in the neighbourhood. ‚Ä¶
82,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great place, amazing beers üëç"
83,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great tap room at the Brewery! You probably already know their beer is good. The food is good too, nice to get off the beaten path."
84,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Truly exceptional craft brewers making special, subtle beers with a great deal of love and commitment. Coming from Portland, Oregon, I am spoiled for choice in beer but this is a worthy destination. Food available after 5pm..."
85,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely beers, cool atmosphere!"
86,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,These guys make great beers! Their events are always a blast. It‚Äôs great to be able to peek into the brewery while also enjoying the interesting decor and alternative vibe.

88,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"One of the better beer spots, because the Beef Chief is also here."
89,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The third brewing location of the Oedipus Brewing company is only just up and running. Their tap room offers a fine selection of their own brews as well as one or two collaborations with other breweries. The atmosphere is nice and relaxed and the staff know their beers.
90,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really awesome artisan beers with funky names and fantastic ingredients, all made here, at this great place! Now and then they organise special events. Check their website for those or just walk in from Thursdays till sundays, from 15h till late."
91,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lots of great beers, a complete wheel of styles, absolutely love it. The food is adventurous and very well done, gorgeous burgers and fries."
92,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place to have locally brewed beers. Location is also convenient. Just two stops plus 6 mins walking from Central Station Amsterdam. I really recommend you to the ""Thai Thai""!"
93,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Beers! Great Vibe. This place seems like it would fit right in Austin Texas. The food is pretty killer and goes well with their brews.
94,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Always great vibes!
Incredible smash burgers."
95,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Visiting Amsterdam, we four homebrewers wanted adventure, so we took the free ferry to Noord Amsterdam and GPS'd our way to Oedipus where we stayed two hours sampling, quaffing, and supping. Their burgers were really good. Their twelve ‚Ä¶"
96,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great atmosphere, feels just like any brewery on the west coast of north america, very laid back. Great beer, west coast IPA could be hoppier though. Who'd have though Thai spice would go so well with a tripel!"
97,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A very cool artisenal brewery, they have a (very) large range of beers you have probably never had before. They are overly creative with their naming and with their ingredients, my personal favorite is the Thai Thai version!"
98,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"All the beers here are delicious. You can taste the West Coast (California) influence, but with a unique added flair. A must visit for home brewers and craft beer enthusiasts."
99,Oedipus Brewing, 1 star ,4 years ago,"As much as I like this place, it is highly disappointing. It is reported to be open at 14:00 - but the kitchen is not open till 16:00. This is not reported anywhere, which made me come all the way up North. It's so easy to update your ‚Ä¶"

101,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very unique concept beers. Fresh Beer Friday is a hit.
102,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,6 years ago,If you're a fan of local microbreweries this is a must visit. An excellent varying selection of home brewn beers in an old warehouse. Cool place to get away from the regular tourist traps.
103,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fun place.  Looks like a converted warehouse.  Beers are great.  The burgers and fries are very good.  Some unusual, yet surprisingly good fries (e.g. with Korean kimchi)."
104,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great craft brewery with a very chill and hip vibe, and diverse selection of beers. Great business that is helping make North Amsterdam cool."
105,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Enjoyed some delicious local beers and probably the best chips of my life. Do visit if you're in the area - it's a vibrant place with plenty of character.
106,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super good burgers and fries, the best beer (and what a variety!!!) And super friendly staff. No coffee though."
107,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,a year ago,Awesome place with great beer and food! Super nice atmosphere inside and outside
108,Oedipus Brewing, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Besides the beer, the service by the so called ""owner"" was beyond rude. So the kitchen was closed and the  BBQ wasn't going to be put on until 5pm, it was 3:45pm and well the only food they have behind the bar are roasted almonds and well ‚Ä¶"

113,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great selection of beers, nice bug open space in taproom and outdoor seating. As far as taprooms go, it's a winner and worth the short trek from central Amsterdam"
114,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,a year ago,Brewer was fab but the restaurant inside the brewery  is pretty terrible. The chips are veeeeery bad but the burgers are quite good
115,Oedipus Brewing, 1 star ,a year ago,"Really, really lousy service. The girl behind the bar (Leigh) was extremely rude for no reason. ‚Ä¶"
116,Oedipus Brewing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great beers good food. Surprised by burger
117,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A local brewery with some interesting beers (and if you don't like beer... try the ""Stoute Cola""!). Easy to commute to by bike, and bus; if you need to do some groceries, Jumbo Foodmarkt Amsterdam is next this brewery."
118,Oedipus Brewing, 5 stars ,a year ago,Oww so yummmmy and cozy
