27,Dope, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Stunning pizzas and tiramisu. However, don't take reservations at 7.30 if you can only manage to serve drinks at 8.00 and take a food order one hour after we sat down. Hire more staff if you're that busy"

36,Dope, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Crazy good vegan four cheese pizza. The service was incredible, we had to change table and got given a really tasty vegan tiramisu for the 'hassle'. They serve wine in Italian quantities, and offer pizza so good that you'll ignore your stomach and eat the whole thing. Cannot recommend this place more."
37,Dope, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love pizza. My friends love pizza. Every week, we eat pizza... so when I go on holiday this ‚Äòaddiction‚Äô doesn‚Äôt get overlooked. Add this to the fact that sightseeing Amsterdam is hungry work so what better way to fuel the trip than with ‚Ä¶"
38,Dope, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Dope is the place where pizza reaches its finest expression. Careful research in the mix of flours used to make the dough, superbe quality ingredients and highly talented pizza makers, together produce an outstanding result. La calabrese with burrata & la pizza fritta are my top choices. Definitely suggested!"
39,Dope, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Very bad service, with bad manners. We went there to see friends, and the owner yelled at my friend and I because we were not sure about our order (""I have a business to run, leave if you don't order now"" even if nobody was waiting for a ‚Ä¶"

42,Dope, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Advertised as takeout/ delivery, but after a long walk to their location I was told dine in only. What pizza place only does dine in?! This one! Good luck‚Ä¶"
43,Dope, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Absolutely amazing pizza, great wine and the waitress was so friendly and helpful.
The only bad thing I could say is that it's located in Amsterdam and we are not."
44,Dope, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"This is a place we will return to. Together with Eatmosfera Oost, around the corner from where we live, Pizzeria Dope serves the best pizza's in town. Really, really good. Simple choice of wine: white or red. But don't be fooled, it's a ‚Ä¶"

50,Dope, 3 stars ,5 months ago,We went to this place when it was super crowded and I was disappointed that my pizza dint have Artichoke like it was mentioned on the menu. They replaced it with Aubergine and some other veggies. The service was okay and they took almost an hour and a half to get two pizzas. I guess we went at the wrong time.
51,Dope, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly and very kind people are around there. The pizza was perfect, I would even say the best pizza I‚Äôve ever eaten. Definitely, worth to check it out."
52,Dope, 1 star ,6 months ago,"We waited for 45 minutes to get our food, they were obciously understaffed and nobody even came to ask us for drinks or after we finished to pay or anything. Terrible experience, everyone around js was very hungry and also waiting forever. ‚Ä¶"
53,Dope, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Pizza is delicious and super light, with high quality ingredients! It's way better than the pizza I used to eat at home, in Italy <3 also the staff is nice and helpful, and restaurant has a spectacular design, from the chairs to the coffe machine."
54,Dope, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Apparently great vegetarian options, but it took over 40 minutes before we could order our pizzas."
55,Dope, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Ok pizza restaurant. Very small, not many tables. Tried one of the vegan pizzas, was ok. The dough could use some more salt. The beer was ok, but too expensive. Very friendly people working there. Cirka 20 euros for pizza and a beer, that's a bit too expensive."
56,Dope, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Super busy so make sure to book but the pizza is great, service is so friendly and personal and the tiramisu is phenomenal."
57,Dope, 1 star ,8 months ago,"I used to love this place  and really made the effort to come here as things opened after covid. What a nasty disappointment, never in my life have I been screamed at by a so called owner of a restaurant before! They can‚Äôt handle the stress ‚Ä¶"

61,Dope, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Had to wait for over an hour to just order because apparently the oven is limited.... but once the pizza came... oh my God!! Absolutely worth the wait and the frustration watching others get their food and enjoy each bite... I won't hesitate going back and wait another hour for a peace of that pizza ..we'll worth the wait!!

I will certainly go back üçï"
76,Dope, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I went there for the first time tonight, with a couple of friends. The pizza was really good, with fresh and Italian ingredients. It tasted like the pizza we're used to eat in Italy, or even better.
It's really worth to pay a visit! I'll be back for sure!"
77,Dope, 3 stars ,7 months ago,The pizza was really good. But the service was verry slow. The 2 waitresses seems to have some difficulties in there organisation. Hope for they that will be better in the future.

88,Dope, 1 star ,a year ago,"Tl;dr: the menu advises you to tell the staff if you have food allergies - don't bother, go elsewhere. There are many excellent places that deal in kindness and respect. This place doesn't deserve your money. ‚Ä¶"
89,Dope, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had two amazing pizza's of Dope yesterday, the Margherita and the St. Daniele. Perfect combination of fresh made pizza dough and great ingredients!!! Definitely, one of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam (de Pijp) to have dinner or take-away."
90,Dope, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best (vegan) pizza I ever had! The thin dough is delicious and the vegan cheeses are top notch! I was shocked to see that Mastino had closed but as I understand their pizza baker just took over the place and I can still get my fix of the vegan four cheese pizza! Much worth a visit!
91,Dope, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best original Napolitan pizza in Amsterdam to date! Fresh superb ingredients and proper dough. Guys are very friendly and cat is adorable! In one phrase: worth getting fat over :p
92,Dope, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Craft, professionalism, passion in a niche with minimal furnishings and limited capacity. But here, this is not what matters. In fact, what is striking is the huge variety of pizzas, the quality of the ingredients and especially the doughs. ‚Ä¶"

94,Dope, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place!!! Space, space... well, in Amsterdam we know that this can be an issue sometimes more when busy periods but nevertheless this is about pizza and not real state ;) The pizzas we've got were great! (Troped's Queen and Flower ‚Ä¶"
95,Dope, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Very good Pizza, the management was a bit bad though. The staff and the chefs were very nice but they keep no seat spacing between tables and it seems as if they try to cram as many seats inside as possible. That's okay with me in general but during a pandemic I think they should really avoid that."
96,Dope, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I tried this Pizzeria last week. For me its the best pizza that I have had in Amsterdam and I would highly recommend it. I will be back to try another pizza from the menu very soon, thank you :)"
