0,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Good food, friendly service, fair prices. The portions were a bit too large for me (I felt full at about 3/4 of my bowl and couldn‚Äôt finish it) and I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I was meant to do with the sriracha mayo you get with The Original ‚Ä¶"
1,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,a month ago,You get value for your money because they give a lot of food. Service is really good!
2,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Very tasty the Witzel poke bowl üòã I recommend this place!
3,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,4 months ago,I ordered tonight a Spicy Sriracha Tuna via Thuisbezorgd from the Pinsengracht location. What arrived (late but that's not the point of this post) is what is on the attached picture. A bunch of soggy lettuce leaves in a watery mayonaise. ‚Ä¶
4,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"There is a photo on google maps that show seats. But once there, there were no seats. And no airconditioning. The benches have been occupied with plants. That was a huge disappointed so we had to eat elsewhere. ‚Ä¶"
5,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Girl who served me had super bad attitude, no need. Almost ‚Ç¨20 for a bowl of chopped veg, some 'vegan salmon' which I was informed was tapioca and water, and a sqiurt of Sriracha basically.."
6,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,a month ago,Julia is as always a perfect host. The best location of Poke Perfect in Amsterdam or anywhere else.
7,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,4 months ago,"We ordered online for a big group of people, knowing that it will take longer.  They gave us a specific pick up time, but when we got there they haven't even started yet.  As working individuals who have specific lunch times this is utterly ‚Ä¶"
8,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic poke, fresh fish, great veggies and toppings. One of the Best bowls I have ever had. Friendly staff and modern restaurant. One of. My new favourite in Amsterdam <3"
9,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great clean looking place. The food was delicious, and they were great with their gluten free options. Really friendly and helpful staff"
10,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,6 months ago,It was pretty good! I've had better tho. My ceviche bowl has an insane amount of radishes
11,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tried the tempeh bowl with kale and crispy tofu sushito. Both are very good. If you‚Äôre also ordering the salad bowl, might be better to take the larger size."
12,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Big portions and friendly service. Staff didn't seem very efficient though; people had to wait while staff were doing something else. They could improve the seating area; although there are quite some seats, it's not great when stranger need to sit together."
13,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very fresh and amazing. Very clean inside and well priced. Just ordering a regular bowl size is enough to fill you up.
14,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice looking food, that tastes great too. Can make your meal how you like it, with many choices. Seating is limited, but the atmosphere is nice, like the staff"
15,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic Pok√© in Amsterdam. The big bowl is almost too much food but it‚Äòs delicious. Price is okay and I would‚Äòve liked a bit more sauce. But overall very nice place where you can eat, but you can also take away which is very convenient."
16,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,a month ago,Great quality food with plenty of choices for a healthy meal.
17,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"You will have what you really order, just like it's photo. I liked it"
18,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly and nice staff. The pok√© bowl was very good and tuna was fresh. The only thing I didn't like were the tables, they were dirty. They should wipe them more often."
19,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Really great poke! Some of the best I‚Äôve had üëå
20,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Not really made with love or even attention, just filling a bowl with ingredients like a cantine - I assume she had a bad day . Additional dirty seats and cushion, time for a refresh?"
21,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Wonderfully delicious but expensive and service isn't very very nice
22,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Love their poke bowls. Never disappointing. We tried a few other poke bowl places but we didnt find anything better. Big portions, sauces are very tasty and recently I've tried a few vegan options - loved them too. Curious to try more options from the new menu! :)"
23,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Super delicious bowl we had there! The staff was also very friendly üòä
24,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I liked the place as a whole and good portion size
25,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Great food but not nearly enough staff to service their customers. Such a shame.
26,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect place for a yummy, relatively healthy lunch or quick dinner. Ingredients are always fresh & tasty."
27,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, people here are really friendly and cool. The food is fresh and so good!"
28,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We came by to order the Vegan Original several times. The food is really delicious. Unfortunately we felt like the staff is really not that enthusiastic, not happy to see you back, or even up for a little chat at all. It‚Äôs the little things that would make the Poke ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù experience perfect, we felt were lacking."
29,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place, nice waitress, good food and not too expensive. Paying is card only though."
30,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good variety of options and decent portion sizes for a reasonable price. Only downside is there is no seating.
31,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I really loved it. I ordered the vegan one (never thought that I would as I really like my meat) and let me say this. Vegan food is the bombüëå. The girl that served us was really nice and patient. My friend couldn't decide what she wanted because of the many choices that they had.
32,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to eat, you will get full but will not feel heavy afterwards.

The food is very good, it's tasty and place is kept clean and sterilized. ‚Ä¶"
33,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice food, stay friendly, cheap food for pokebowl"
34,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Way too little toppings for the size of the bowl, the hot foods were served cold. Wouldn't really recommend"
35,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It's a really nice place! You can create your own bowls and they have a lot of options to choose from! The only thing is that you can not sit down and enjoy your meal because it's only for take away but if you know that in advance it's ‚Ä¶
36,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We were sadly a little disappointed. The store is more of a fast food type where you order to-go. There is no seating available inside. Also we didn‚Äôt like how over half the bowl is rice and there was too little of chicken/fish. Decent flavors and sauces.
37,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a great experience üòç i want more of your food!
38,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Quiet tasty and really generous but it's not really confortable to eat there. Table are too tiny and too little for me.
39,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,5 months ago,Ate inside but they didn‚Äôt ask to scan vaccination QR code.
40,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best poke bowl in Amsterdam. Good value compared to the other poke places and they let you substitute ingredients without an extra charge. I regularly eat in and order from this place.
41,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,4 years ago,I loved this place when it opened! I'm vegetarian and always order the Soy Joy Bowl & my partner always makes his own bowl with ahi tuna & avocado.  It was fresh and flavorful. But my last couple orders have been incredibly subpar. My ‚Ä¶
42,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice place, fair price and delicious !"
43,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,2 years ago,"No more indoor seating, take out only, credit card or pin card only, no cash. They don‚Äôt even pack forks or napkins in the bag for you. The fish in the bowl was substandard. Lots of rice, lots of cucumber, not a lot of anything else. I‚Äôd say skip. There is no sort shortage of good poke in Amsterdam."
44,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They have 2 very nice vegan bowls. The large bowls are really large and for a decent price compared to the restaurants around in this area.
So definitely a very good option! I loved it"
45,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Meh. In a city that seems to love raw fish, one  variety of fish - salmon only- on poke is a big disappointment. Course when I get home, I‚Äôll head straight to Poke and a Half which has maybe twenty different choices of yummy fish. And get ‚Ä¶"
46,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love that place! Ordered from it first time via Deliveroo or so and really enjoyed it. Never had such a dish before (Pokebowl is how it‚Äôs called I think). The specific meal I ordered was called ‚ÄòThe Witzel‚Äô and it‚Äôs rice with raw salmon, ‚Ä¶"
47,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The concept of the restaurant is really cool, the location is good and the decoration is pleasant. I had the salmon bowl, and it didn't really meet my expectations. I thought there wasn't enough salmon and too much cucumber. Also frustrated to not have teriyaki sauce..."
48,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious and fresh! Friendly staff and fair prices.
49,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Excellent and fresh bowls. The sauces and toppings are delicious.
50,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really great poke. I liked it a lot
51,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Yesterday I have ordered a poke bowl from Poke Perfect Prinsengracht, just as I have done many times before. To my disappointment, I have noticed that the restaurant has changed the size of the box they serve the poke bowls in. In my poke ‚Ä¶"
52,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A great addition to the neighborhood. I give it 5 stars for Amsterdam as I'd say it's hard overall to find good sushi or food in general that has enough flavor to satisfy my higher Californian salt and spice tolerence. Since you can ‚Ä¶
53,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Tasty with lots of menu options.
54,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice concept. Staff was friendly. I was at the one at the Kinkerstraat. The food is fresh and they have a choice of rice, quinoa, kale and something else as a base. However, I ordered the sriracha tuna bowl and the tuna was of bad quality. ‚Ä¶"
55,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty tasty filling Poke bowls (got regular spicy tuna and it was fabulous). Would do 5 stars but plastic bowls to stay are really too wasteful plus I don‚Äôt want to eat out of plastic unless I have to.
56,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Portions are fair and food is great and healthy! Plenty of options to fill your bowl with and great for vegetarians. Seating is very limited, so I advise to take it to go and find a park to eat."
57,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Interesting experience at Poke Perfect. I was obsessed for months and went almost every other week until I went one week with my friend. The fish from the poke bowl gave her food poisoning and she was very sick for the rest of the evening.
58,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious, vegan and absolute amazing! We will definitely come back!"
59,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I ordered with Uber Eats and I'm typically a Sla orderer but this time I went Pok√© and they are sure giving Sla some stiff competition!! ‚Ä¶
60,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I went to the Kinkerstraat branch a couple of times for the susherito. Each time I was disappointed. The rice has absolutely no flavor, and even the spicy mayo isn't very spicy. The roll came apart as soon as I started unwrapping it. The ‚Ä¶"
61,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I got a ""build your own bowl"" with salmon, mango, cucumber, edamame, and the sriracha mayo. Absolutely no flavor. My partner ordered the Somkin 6 and found it to be way too salty, and again, basically no flavor. Poke is one of our favorite dishes, but this place totally let us down."
62,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I ordered a kale salad for my lunch break at work, waited 45min to receive my order to find out I got the wrong order. It was a rice base salad, instead of the kale salad I have ordered. ‚Ä¶"
63,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Portions have become so small, you‚Äôd need to order 2 bowls to get an actual bowl. Every week they have new employees so expect inexperienced workers prepping your bowl every time. It says a lot about the ever decreasing quality there."
64,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My first poke bowl was here and this place has succesfully turned me into a Poke lover
65,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Quality seems to be slipping. Had some tuna lately that was either old or just of poor quality.  Other toppings have not tasted as fresh recently either.  Bummer, as there were none of these issues when they first opened."
66,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I was recently in Amsterdam for 5 days and this was for sure the best meal I eat on the whole trip it was just so original and I loved that you can make your own bowl and most importantly it tasted amazing.
67,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Generous proportions and fresh ingredients - delicious!
68,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"they made the rice pink for pride it was so cute. even made us a bowl right before they were closing, super friendly staff!!! thanks!"
69,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,2 years ago,Poke Perfect was a bad experience. The food was really not tasty. One of the worst Pok√© tried in Amsterdam.
70,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,5 years ago,I'd give a 5-star if they'd have more places to sit and if their spicy tuna would actually be spicy. I always have to ask for extra chilli pepper to make it hot. ‚Ä¶
71,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,11 months ago,"Dear owner.
Your staff is such a lazy people. Bad Communication. Food is not good quality. Not recommended"
72,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, and lovely personel. I ordered online via Uber eats and got a wrong order. One guy from the crew (Marco) took care of the order himself and delivered as requested.
Fantastic!"
73,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Broad selection of delicious, fresh ingredients to make you pok√© as simple or ridiculous as you like. Served by friendly staff in a nice interior, though it has very few places to sit."
74,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love all the vegan options and the sense of sustainability, like the option to use a reusable glass container. Perfect for regular visitors üòä"
75,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Clean and fresh poke bowls - either off the menu or build your own. Quite a lot of rice though so maybe ask for a little less if you're not starving.
76,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I ordered a poke bowl and a miso soup. The miso soup was way to salty, so I had to add some hot water myself. For the poke bowl I can only say that I had better ones before."
77,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,4 years ago,I went there with my friend today. We ordered the 'build it yourself' bowls. It's been 4h later and we still have stomach aches. Overhyped spot. Not recommended
78,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very nice staff, good service and delicious food!!"
79,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Simply: delicious and awesome! I really love this food. You can make it how you like it. It is take a way only.
80,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect place to have a cold lunch, good selection of produce. They were fresh and tasty... I recommend quinoa as base....:)"
81,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good food, combination of Japanese ingredients and Hawaiian POKE balls. If you like sushi, you NEED to try it."
82,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, but no cash accepted and even if you eat in disposable packaging¬†materials are used"
83,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had better rice and the siracha tuna can be spicier but overall a nice poke bowl shop with nice interior and proper service.
84,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious Pok√© bowls. You can enjoy them inside or take them outside to enjoy them overlooking Amsterdam‚Äòs canals.
85,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Good healthy food... Hawaiian influenced food with you having total control over the many variants and combinations of building Your own plate....Must visit again...
86,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,4 years ago,Probably good food however the service with customers using Thuisbezorgd is deplorable. I asked for a change of delivery time but they forward me to Thuisbezorgd who explicitly say that delivery changes have to be handled by the restaurant...
87,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Simple, good and not too expensive for what you get. Too bad there aren't that many seating places. Would go here again!"
88,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice place. Food is really good and the prices is also pretty low.
89,Pok√© Perfect, 1 star ,a year ago,Awful! Flooding the bowl with cheap soy sauce! We didn't want to continue only mid way through the bowl
90,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really friendly employees and tasty food. Not the cheapest place but normal prices for poke. Card payment only.
91,Pok√© Perfect, 3 stars ,a year ago,The food in overall is delicious but selling air is next level
92,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious bowl, had a regular ‚Äúthe original‚Äù, size was good"
93,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Way to expensive for what it is, a bowl of rice 2/3 with 10 pieces of salmon/chicken and since vegetables. Mediocre taste"
94,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent place and food. Discovered it yesterday and it was delicious at a good $. The people working there also friendly (exceptional for Amsterdam)
95,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice cuisine. Really good interior, but use Uber Eats to order food, not much space for dining inside."
96,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 months ago,The poke is delicious
97,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,a year ago,Wonderful food and atmosphere. I had a great night
98,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is a sushi fastfood place,, what you order is what you get. Also there are no seats at this place but the food is good for take away!"
99,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great tasting poke, fresh ingredients, but service was very slow (not the fault of the employees)."
100,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My first time having poke and it definitely lived up to its hype. An overwhelming amount of options.
101,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is not that bad to what you can find in the area, however the staff is not very nice. I would suggest them to improve A LOT on this."
102,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"You can build your own meal from many choices, and the taste is great!"
103,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best poke bowl in town!
104,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Only takeaway. Big Bowls. Very tasty. Pls come to Hannover(Germany)

106,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best poke bowls in town! Love to have my lunch from them!
107,Pok√© Perfect, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Not so busy but tastes great. Quality food prepared.
108,Pok√© Perfect, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was really slow, but the final outcome was very tasty"
109,Pok√© Perfect, 2 stars ,3 years ago,They always forget to add the extra ingredients when you order online. They're getting lazy. A shame.
