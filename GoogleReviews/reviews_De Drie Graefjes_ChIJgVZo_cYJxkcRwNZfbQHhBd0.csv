3,De Drie Graefjes, 3 stars ,5 months ago,I had a chocolate turtle cake. Not impressed at all. Once the quality of this place was higher. Nothing special. Barely had taste. We also took the rainbow cake and the person who had it was satisfied with it.

16,De Drie Graefjes, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Waited 40+ minutes for the waiter to bring us out cold food, served many tables before our own. Would not recommend."

21,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice assortments of cakes and cupcakes
22,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is one of my favorite places. Always very friendly staff, good coffee, great food. And what really deserves the 5 star rating is their real American pastry. Try their carrot cake: it will be the best carrot cake you've ever had!"
23,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Not very spacious but a cosy place to have a cup of coffee with a piece of pie!
24,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place. Although I like Zuid branch more.
The cakes and breakfast are perfect.
We always get the rainbow cake for our little boy. It‚Äôs really good. I like red velvet pancakes and eggs with avocados. Coffee is also good."
25,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,a year ago,"A good place for having breakfast or  coffee.
We went there for breakfast and we were satisfied fully.
The menu offers also vegan options. ‚Ä¶"
26,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We shared one piece of cake, which was more than enough! Sugar overload but in a good way"
27,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best red velvet cake in Amsterdam. If you are craving some rich American style baked goodies, this is your place. I've been here at least 6 or 7 times and I've never been disappointed. It's usually crowded but I've never waited for a table. Try to sit upstairs where there might be a bit more room"
28,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I always love coming here! Somehow I can always find a spot, they serve great vegetarian options and the red velvet cake is to die for. Just one tip: if you plan on eating cake here, just know that one piece of cake on it's own could fill you up for lunch."
29,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing breckfest both me and my girlfriend loved what we got
30,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Impressive service, good food and good staff"
31,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice and cozy place to enjoy some sweet treats. The cakes taste great, but some pieces are really huge for only one person. The price, however, is really ok for these big portions."
32,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Every time I come to Amsterdam I have or get this red velvet cake! It is the absolute best red velvet cake I‚Äôve ever tasted and slices are huge. Lunch is also great here with plenty of options. I‚Äôm vegetarian so I always get the veggie ‚Ä¶
33,De Drie Graefjes, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Extremely pricy for the size and quality of the food, plus the service was really terrible, the waitress was very rude and not welcoming at all. We wefe 5 and first she brought the food for 2 of my friends and when they finished she brought ‚Ä¶"
34,De Drie Graefjes, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I went to De Drie Graefjes with high expectations after my friend had been positive about the place but I was a bit disappointed. The chocolate swirl cheesecake was not that good and the red velvet cake was too dry. If it was not for the friendly staff I would have given two stars instead of three.
35,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Such a good place! I come here very often, and I always order something different to try. It always turns out delicious! The staff is very friendly and help you out very fast. ‚Ä¶"
36,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The cupcakes are good, even better than the regular bakeries in the US."
37,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Two words: Red velvet. Don't lie and to yourself thinking this is healthy, it's not. But it's an amazing treat that your taste buds will thank you for. I also tasted the carrot cake and the icing used for both is amazing- not too heavy, not too sweet, it's delicious. My mouth is watering while I write this review."
38,De Drie Graefjes, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The carrot cake is amazing. The. Bad thing is the service. The waiters seems to match what everybody says : they are just students who want to finish quickly and dont care about the customers. Ours drop the coffee on the tray and disnt make ‚Ä¶
39,De Drie Graefjes, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not very spacious but it is in the center of Amsterdam so you can't ask for more space.
Quite pricy for a tea and cake place. I have had red velvet cake and red velvet ‚Ä¶"
40,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect for your sweet tooth craving. Nice selection of cakes, muffins and cupcakes. Generous layer of icing on the red velvet!! Also good for breakfast and lunch. Highly recommended."
41,De Drie Graefjes, 1 star ,a year ago,"Inadequate service. There was nobody at the counter for 10 minutes, then a waiter made a few rude comments while I was waiting for somebody to show up, then they pretended they don't understand that I wanted to buy a whole cake, and, in the end, refused to sell anything, although there was a full fridge of cakes."
42,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing place ! My chicken burger tasted wonderful (just like everything I saw on other tables). The service was perfect : a little lady was alone, overwelmed but here to ask us if we enjoyed our meal. I strongly recommend this restaurant !"
43,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you're visiting Amsterdam and you are a sweet tooth like me, you should definitely visit De Drie Graefjes! They have the best cakes in The Netherlands for a soft price, given the huge piece you get. :)"
44,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place. the cakes were AMAZING, good coffee. Just to say something regular, the waiter was a bit confused or mad.. but the quality of the sweets is amazing!"
45,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place, is cute and the cakes are really good."
46,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The homemade quiche was delicious, but the carrot cake had pineapple and raisins in it. Thats not what carrot cake is like back home, but maybe this is the dutch version. Still pretty good cake. Staff really helpfull and nice."
47,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best breakfast we had in Amsterdam! Big portions for a reasonable price. Sit upstairs and gaze over one of the busy streets! They have another location, the exact same menu but bigger."
48,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Absolutely delicious cakes and coffees
49,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly and quick staff, lunch and drinks aren‚Äôt special but their cakes always hit the spot. Red velvet and rainbow are definitely my favorite."
50,De Drie Graefjes, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"We got carrot cake and a turtle cake from here with high expectations given the reputation, but while my carrot cake was the best I'd ever has (genuinely), the turtle cake was dry. And not just ""eh, this is a dry cake"" dry, but a ""I may have been able to make this better at home myself"" dry"
51,De Drie Graefjes, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I love the cakes at this place! It is my first time at this place. I mostly go to the one at Rokin. This place is more vintage and marginal. The other one feels more modern.
52,De Drie Graefjes, 1 star ,3 years ago,"One star cause I can give them less. We waited for fifteen minutes to be attended and the waiter didn‚Äôt even care for us, even though he asked to the people sitting next to us. We were hungry and hopeful, and we left hungrier and disappointed."
53,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I keep going back. Amazing multi storey cakes, you can pick a whole as a  birthday cake as well. Fresh ingredients for lunch. Coffee needs a lot  more love though.."
54,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fun local small breakfast and lunch place! Friendly, helpful staff and good food.  Good food variety on menu. Try the double Expresso and  one of their desserts!"

56,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Visited the bakery
Pleasant staff, friendly place
Great pastries"
57,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favorite lunchspots in Amsterdam. Besides the amazing cakes, muffins and cupcakes (I recommend the red velvet, Carrot cake or a Blondie) they serve nice sandwiches and soups"
58,De Drie Graefjes, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cakes are obviously awesome there.  But service made me laugh a lot. I asked for a glass of water but I was refused because it was too busy. But I insisted and I got like literally 50ml in the glass. How is that even possible üòÇüòÇüòÇ
59,De Drie Graefjes, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Delciuos cake and nice waiters. Relatively expensive prices, but worth it!"
