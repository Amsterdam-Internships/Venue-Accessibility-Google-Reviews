35,Melly’s Cookie Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good coffee, cookies/cakes and sandwiches. Nice and cosy. One star off because the fresh juices are served in plastic cups with a plastic straw, even if you don't order it as takeaway. There are many other sustainable options available for restaurants, so single use plastic is just not acceptable anymore."
36,Melly’s Cookie Bar, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We visited Melly's place guided by its rating in Google Maps and we are really glad we did! All the service was great! Polite, friendly and fast.

60,Melly’s Cookie Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place to find argentine products. I really like stopping here for a coffee and an alfajor. There's place for about 6 people to sit down,

62,Melly’s Cookie Bar, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"It's a small place, can't really sit down to enjoy coffee. Coffee was ok, nothing special, I went there because of the excellent reviews, but felt like it was just an average place, mainly for take away coffee."
