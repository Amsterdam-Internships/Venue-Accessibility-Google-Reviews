1,Castell, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Ribs were amazing, steak was a bit chewy. Dont love the eating on your lap concept"
2,Castell, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"5 years later, still the best spare ribs I ate. They probably have the same cook. Highly recommended"
3,Castell, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very tasty T-bone. Not fires or regulars sides. I went with the baked potato and it was excellent
4,Castell, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Awesome steak, fast Service.
For some reason, asking for tap water proved to be difficult to get.
Also, the style of eating in your lap is not ideal, even though more comfortable than expected"
5,Castell, 5 stars ,a month ago,Been coming here for 10 years and it has never disappointed. Love the 70‚Äôs vibe and the spareribs are killer.
6,Castell, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Loved this spot. Great food, super cool vibe. Excellent steak, wine etc."
7,Castell, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy, dark and large ground oriented underground restaurant. This place is always pack hence do remember to make a reservation. ‚Ä¶"
8,Castell, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Last time I went with my boyfriend for the anniversary, it was a big let down. The meat was chewy and it felt like reheated. I used to come here for spare ribs and those were good but definitely make me doubt the quality of meat in general here."
9,Castell, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Disappointing. Rib-eye so thin like a shoe sole. It was impossible to create a crosty skin with a juicy inside. It points out at a very poor choice making in the kitchen - either their chef wants to save time or money. Either way - not the ‚Ä¶
10,Castell, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is good but the service is not up to par.  You should know that you have only two hours for dinner at this restaurant.  If you decide to order more than one meal course, you will need to eat fairly quickly.  I do not recommend it.  There are also better dining options at the Castle Restaurant."
11,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,After my 5th time eating I can truly say its fantastic. Very unique surroundings and a real good night of quality barbecue food. It's much cosier in winter because they have a real fireplace you sit around to eat.
12,Castell, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food and service, ribs are amazing!"
13,Castell, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A very good meat place.
Exists for decades.
Apart from the fact that they are not pets friendly, it is a good choice for ‚Ä¶"
14,Castell, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic food. Unorthodox eating arrangements. Guests are seated around a fire and eat on their laps with trays. Lighting is low but the food is fantastic. Place opens at 5 but grilling starts at 5.30.
15,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely spot for a great meal with friends on a warm day, or you can stop by the bar for a nice drink and conversation. All around amazing experience, at Castell they really pay attention to detail and service!"
16,Castell, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Huge steak, nice service and food. :)"
17,Castell, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Came here a year ago, then on our return visit to Amsterdam, we had to come back here. Staff are welcoming, kind and very helpful, the atmosphere is warm and cosy, and the food? Words can't do it justice, the quality of their meat is simply ‚Ä¶"
18,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Castell is my favourite grill restaurant at Amsterdam. Food is always delicious and service is great. I ate spare ribs (which was perfect) and tried frogs legs for the first time (absolutely delicious) at my last visit. Highly recommended. Don't forget to reserve a table...
19,Castell, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place! Best of grill places. I give 4 star because they have ony two kind of beers :( Leader! Please put more variaty of beers also not just wines! :) Anyway its a lovely place, really loved it. Kind ppl."
20,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"a great place for your fix of spare ribs, and also other steaks and meats. Be ready for a quite unique eating experience - there's no regular tables and chairs, only high chairs or seating by the fireplace"
21,Castell, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Certainly hasn't got any cheaper over the years but still one of the very best places for steak in Amsterdam. Great service also. Recommended.

23,Castell, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The steak is really good. The atmosphere is cosy and the staff welcoming.
24,Castell, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Easy to miss place tucked in one of the side  streets of Amsterdam. They offer good selection of meats. Portions are good sizes as advertised in the menu. Food is good, no complaints here. Service was as well professional and quick. Prices ‚Ä¶"
25,Castell, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Reading some mixed reviews here, so this place seems a little hit and miss. We tend to avoid Leidseplein due to tourists and this is close, but seemed a bit more exclusive. We managed to get a table outside without a reservation - great ‚Ä¶"
26,Castell, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are a beef dry aged lover, you will be upset. The quality is below your expectations. The music of the place is too loud and you are expected to eat with the plate on your knees. The ratio of quality/price is not interesting."
27,Castell, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Very good food, didn't like the feeling of eating on our lap..."
28,Castell, 5 stars ,a year ago,"If you like meat, this is the place to visit in Amsterdam. This place is unsuited for vegetarians."
29,Castell, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Good food nice atmosphere
30,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Still my favourite place for meats and beers! Great food and atmosphere.
31,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Probably my best spare ribs go to restaurant in the world! Been here a couple of times; ribs, steak, baked potatoes, escargot are a must order! Though I wish the place can be abit brighter and have more seats ;)"
32,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best foodie place frequnted by locals. Pretty much everything on the menu is a hit. Sometimes service gets slow.
33,Castell, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Ordered a sirloin and a fillet. Both were very rubbery. The waiter asked if we wanted a salad or a potato and when we said salad she charged is extra for it. At some point the meat started dripping all over the table and dripped on the floor. Also, the waiter was really aggressive and hostile."
34,Castell, 5 stars ,a year ago,My wife and I had an enjoyable and awesome time there. Very Unique style of dining. Sitting on a cosy sofa with a wooden chop block on your lap to have your dining experience. Steak was cooked to almost perfection. Ribs was tasty and ‚Ä¶
35,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"AMAZING!!! Food and service were incredible!

Place was cozy, people so friendly"

37,Castell, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice food - good ambience.  Great place for a date.
38,Castell, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Fantastic place to have a nice dinner. Excellent food and wine.
39,Castell, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Onolion soup was good. The steak, however, is not worthy. Sauce of the steak was quite good, ironically."
40,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing outstanding steak! If you are a meat lover, this is the place to come !"
41,Castell, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious food , really nice people and the place look amazing . Atmosphere there is so nice ! üëåüòä"
42,Castell, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Brazilian steak done with Dutch perfection.  Couldn‚Äôt have a better combination.

47,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a place! My girlfriend booked this restaurant for my birthday and it is easily one of the best places I have ever eaten. ‚Ä¶
48,Castell, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing food, but not a fan of eating from lap"
49,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best steak I have ever eaten, amazing venue and atmosphere is just great. Try and get a seat at the bar as this is where the action happens and you get kept entertained by the bar staff. We managed to get a walk-in table but we were told it ‚Ä¶"
50,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best ribs ever. üòç

Ps: definitely a try are the frog legs"
51,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's pretty expensive, but the service is great and the meals (especially the spare ribs) are really good."
52,Castell, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Amazing food. Excellent service. Order the Black Angus medium!
53,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, awesome food along with awesome service."
54,Castell, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The best rack in town hands-down.
55,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent service, 350g Sirloin cooked medium-rare to perfection."
56,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We came across this spot while wandering around and am I glad we stopped for an early dinner. The food is absolutely delicious ‚Äî we had the ribs and the grilled chicken, which might have been the best piece of moist, juicy, tasty chicken ‚Ä¶"
57,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We flew to Amsterdam from the UK specifically to eat here again. Our fourth time in Amsterdam, and our fourth visit to Castell. We got a great seat, right in front of the grill. Staff were as welcoming and attentive as ever. Our coats taken ‚Ä¶"
58,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere and different setting compared to your normal restaurant. Staff were welcoming and polite.
The food is just AMAZING! BEST STEAK I've had in a long time and would definitely Recommend this place for you foodies out there."
59,Castell, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Restaurant was great!! Came with a big crew and they were able to accommodate us (with reservations beforehand - make sure to or else you won't get in the night of).  Many in our crew had steaks, I went with the veal and it was great.  Pork ‚Ä¶"
60,Castell, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The ribs were outstanding and everybody else I came with enjoyed their food as well. The only reason it's not a 5-star review is because we couldn't relate to eating a steak or ribs, or anything actually, off of a tray that was put on our lap instead of eating off a table. It was weird and ruined the experience a little for us."
61,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,You should try pork ribs! Your mouth will be in paradiseüí´
62,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have been coming to Castell now for about 15 years and eat here about twice a year when I fancy to treat myself or if I have guests that I don't want to disappoint on a meal out. ‚Ä¶
63,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Steaks are awesome and nice smoky flavor in them. When walking by you could never believe that this restaurant serves such a good food. There's not so many seats but people who want to eat good steak will do so even plates on their laps.
64,Castell, 4 stars ,a year ago,My cousin and I had quite a laugh when we were placed in a sofa close to other guesses and the waitress put a tray on our lap. anecdote we won‚Äôt forget. Not really comfortable but funny. ‚Ä¶
65,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We both had the mixed grill plate and everything in them was absolutely amazing. To the point that I wish I could have dinner again there on the same night and try the rack of ribs. Also, the red wine was really good too."
66,Castell, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It's like going back into the seventies there. Brown leather, brown wood interior, 70's (the wrong kind) music, big bar and big square shared  tables and benches to eat with a plate on your lap. The atmosphere feels strange and comfortable ‚Ä¶"
67,Castell, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This place has a really cool vibe and atmosphere. I loved being in the restaurant. It is so unexpected and very unique! The food is so good too! So much variety you won't be disappointed. The T-bone steak and baked potato were excellent! ‚Ä¶
68,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great steak, nice place and service. Reasonable prices."
69,Castell, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Have you ever been to a restaurant and thought ""gosh, I'd love to eat this huge steak while sitting on a couch""? As weird as it sounds, we did, and it was awesome. The steaks were beyond generous along with the baked potato. My husband and ‚Ä¶"
70,Castell, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Best steak in Amsterdam. Service is always with a smile. Always good visiting this place and they will not disappoint you.
71,Castell, 1 star ,a year ago,"Although the food was nicely presented, it was awful. It‚Äôs really expensive and for that money you get the worst quality meat. I wasn‚Äôt even able to chew my lambchops because it was all rubber bands in the meat. For this price, that‚Äôs a ‚Ä¶"
72,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A must-visit for every trip to the city. V gd bbq, friendly staff, nice atmosphere! Reservations recommended."
73,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We were a group of 4 people and haven't had reservations. the place was full and the waiting was too long (1.5 hours) so we got reservations for the next day. The place is amazing, in a great area and the service is excellent. The menu ‚Ä¶"
74,Castell, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Delicious food (really recommend the ribs), wonderful location and our waiter Jerome was so fun!"
75,Castell, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I didn‚Äôt appreciate my meal  even if the meat was from great quality . It‚Äôs about the atmosphere ...  you know, the energy . The prices are high and we don‚Äôt have so much choices and the salad was awful. We don‚Äôt like wasting the food so we ‚Ä¶"
76,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wait staff were very hospitable and lovely. Made perfect recommendations and we went ahead with the steak and ribs. Beer was good as well. Total bill added to ‚Ç¨55. We are definitely heading back for a second visit!
77,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A fun, social restaurant.  We sat on couches around a central table and used trays. Warning - there's almost nothing for vegetarians other than simple salads and baked potatoes, but all the grilled meats are fantastic."
78,Castell, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We were here with six people with a reserved table. The first surprise was to sit inside on a couch. The waiter was not kidding when he said we‚Äòll eat from our laps.. the mixed starters were okay, the main course meat was fantastic and ‚Ä¶"
79,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best spareribs in Amsterdam, nice ambiance. The cost is a little bit expensive but the general stisfaction is very good, thank you"
80,Castell, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"We were served by an absolutely blunt waiter, who couldn't even tell me what drink options were available or the fact the chicken did not have sides. But as soon as the food was presented I understood exactly why he didn't need to say much. ‚Ä¶"
81,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We were looking for a good steak place and this was recommended by our hotel.  The filet mignon was excellent and perfectly cooked.  The salmon was very tasty too, not overcooked like often happens.  Order the brownie too.   Service was great and the staff had fun personalities too.  We hope to return."
82,Castell, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Good food from the wood grill. Nice service and nice terras outside. Love this place.
83,Castell, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Got recommended to visit this place as they had good steaks and long openings hours. ‚Ä¶
84,Castell, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good for drinks, and great service. Ambience was also extremely cozy... At first, until you come elbow to elbow with other diners as the restaurant fills up. You also have to balance a tray on your lap as you eat, which leaves you at risk ‚Ä¶"
85,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you are a carnivore, you'll love this place"
86,Castell, 1 star ,2 years ago,We were seated by the staff outside then asked to move twice! At which point as we still didn't have a menu/wine list we just left.  I used to go there regularly but the service is so appalling I will just steer clear in future.
87,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had one of my best restaurants experience here. Everything was amazing, both the food and our waiter (Robin). Me and my company agreed on that is was the best ribs we have ever had. The dipping sauces were also delicious. ‚Ä¶"
88,Castell, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Take the spare ribs and shrimps piu piu
89,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy intimate atmosphere and great food.
90,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The ribs. Best ribs of my life.

I was a little disappointed with the sirloin but that's likely just me as ‚Ä¶"
91,Castell, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very unusual dining arrangement. Everyone sits on a sofa with a tray on your lap.
92,Castell, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Came for a meal in a group of 7, we booked and sat on sofas, which were more than comfortable and practical enough to eat on, with a coffee table in the centre. Music was slightly loud for me, but it is a bar too, and atmosphere was great, ‚Ä¶"
93,Castell, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Overall bad experience
-waiters/waitresses looked stressed.
Long time to have the menu and first drinks. ‚Ä¶"
94,Castell, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food is ok, but the service is horrible. I asked twice for tap water and they served us a bottle of water. The bottle was on the bill: 6 euros! When we paid, the waiter told us that we only asked for water, not tap water. Then, when I ‚Ä¶"
95,Castell, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Superb spare ribs. Juicy and tender! Had a delightful bottle of pinot. The fat ass steak was great however a little overcooked. Other than that an all round fantastic experience :) very recommended.
96,Castell, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Lacking options described in menu, we were told that one option was not available anymore and suddenly we saw a table close to us getting the very same food we were told was not available. Menu is definitely not covering what is offered and it was kind of frustrating. Still the concept of this restaurant/bar is nice."
97,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place is awesome. I had the shrimp in spicy garlic sauce appetizer (special) and shared the ribs and a Angus rib-eye steak (special). Everything we ate here was truly fantastic and should make it on your must-eat lists in Amsterdam.
98,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ordered a steak here of course, which was fantastic. They are served with straight edge knives. This seems odd at first, but it was then clear it was to demonstrate how tender the meat was. No serrated edge needed to cut through the meat. The vibe inside was very trendy as well."
99,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We stumbled up this place via a recommendation from a travel group and I am so glad that we did.  We called last minute for a reservation and they were able to accommodate us.  When we arrived we sat at the ""chef's table"" and we could see ‚Ä¶"
100,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We only were in Amsterdam for 2 days and I am so glad we stumbled upon this place! We were hoping to have a late meal and tried to go to a place nearby but it was closed. We saw the tables were full outside and tried here. This was the best ‚Ä¶
101,Castell, 2 stars ,a year ago,Prices are really high. I would say $$$ instead of $$. Place looks like old cheap dirty wooden bar. Glasses for beer were very sticky and dirty.... the beer was not very good too. However keep in mind that I didnt eat there
102,Castell, 3 stars ,7 months ago,I was asking where I can have the best meat in Amsterdam and suggested this place. The meat was not so good as I was expecting.
103,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is the best steak and ribs place in town. Yes, it's a close run race but after many many dinners here, this place gets the cigar. Don't come for the service or even comfortable dining - come for the meat."
104,Castell, 5 stars ,a year ago,I love this restaurant the atmosphere is very relaxed and cosy but yet sophisticated. I highley recommend the ribs and chicken and my favourite the Dutch jacket potato ü•î
105,Castell, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy atmosphere (inspite that you share the table with other people, unless you are sitting outside or in the bar). Some  tables are arranged around a fireplace, looks like perfect for winter (in summer the fire is off). The streaks and wine are of a good quality."
106,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pork ribs is so good. Good service
107,Castell, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Came with high recommendations from a close friend.
I booked a table almost a month ahead to make sure there will be no mishap.
Got on time and received a table to my wife's liking. ‚Ä¶"
108,Castell, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"Very nice restaurant. The waiters were very friendly. The recommended Black Angus beef, the today's special, was excellent! Also the recommended deserts (Stracciatella ice cream with walnut cream and mouse a chocolate). ‚Ä¶"
109,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very cool and trendy place not in the doushe' sense of the word. You sit at big communal tables that sit 12, and eat off your knees. Food is on a lovely wiker tray, don't worry, it's kindda fun actually. We had beer and ribs and a browny for dessert and it totally rocked. Highly recommended !"
110,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Brilliant atmosphere and awesome food.
111,Castell, 1 star ,5 years ago,"For years, I've been reading that Castell had the best spareribs in town, so I was excited to see that they participate in a home delivery service and placed an order. When it arrived and I opened the package, I was shocked to see how black ‚Ä¶"
112,Castell, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Place is quite expensive (a bottle of still water 7,50 euro). The meat tasted ok, but it was not a lot. Staff also was very unfriendly, as If the waitress was doing us a favor taking our orders."
113,Castell, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Outstanding dinner, very nice experience considering most things closed. Will come back for sure, short ribs were awesome!"
114,Castell, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Apart from being kind of expensive, this place offers absolutely tasty food in an unconventional way: eating on your laps in a dark environment. Maybe not the best comfort, however interesting to try. The ribs are wonderful."
115,Castell, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"All in all, it's a good place. Been there 3 times already and I'll come back again. The main downside of this place is the sitting arrangements, especially inside and around the fireplaces, you eat with a food tray on your lap, which is improper to my taste"
116,Castell, 5 stars ,7 months ago,No where else better than there black angus with the baked potato highly recommended
117,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is double 5 star. Wine is good, food is great and atmosphere is wonderful. Over my two trips to Amsterdam I've been 5 times and never disappointed."
118,Castell, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"If you don't already know, Dutch beef is tough as rubber. They have no appreciation for marbling whatsoever. If you have to eat here, I'd recommend getting the lamb and pork."
119,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"LOIS IS THE BEST!!!
Excellent service and atmosphere. We were group of six and we all were satisfied with our meals. PERFECT steaks."
120,Castell, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was excellent , Indonisian kebab and shrimp fabulous as a starter , sirilion , fillet and veal steat were great .
The only weird thing is that no designated table for you so you sit arround a fireplace share a square sofa with other people and you put the food on your lap in such a way ."
121,Castell, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I went to have diner at Castell two weeks ago with my boyfriend and we have been extremely disappointed by the service. Every person working there have been arrogant  and disrespectful to us. ‚Ä¶
122,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really cozy restaurant. Different way of seating (around the bar and in kind of group lounges) but still super gezellig. Delicious steak and great service. It‚Äôs always busy so plan time on.
123,Castell, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We made a reservation and they urged us to arrive in time. We did and we ended up waiting about 45 mins to get seated. The service was horrible.
I gave 3 stars and not 1 because the spare ribs were rediculously good."
124,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Probably the best restaurant I have been to I. Amsterdam!
Staff is great and so is the food.
Dim-lit and yet very cosy and modern. ‚Ä¶"
125,Castell, 1 star ,4 years ago,Castell might be the best BBQ restaurant in Amsterdam. I've been to many others but none was able to beat Castell's black angus. So I try to go there frequently. ‚Ä¶
126,Castell, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If you are from the USA.  Bad service,  bad food and bad attitude. We waited and waited and waited to be served.  Finally we left.  If from USA go somewhere else and don‚Äôt be embarrassed by their attitude.  Very disappointed and left a bad ‚Ä¶"

128,Castell, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing ribs and impressive steaks. Marques de Riscal is always a secure bet!. Very informal and nice to be but missing and are where few tables with chairs to enjoy a more intimate dinner.
129,Castell, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Tourist trap! Deeply disappointing. Staff was arrogant, meat was old, tough and disgusting. There's no ambience at all either. Go to Caf√© De Klos instead. ‚Ä¶"
130,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great atmosphere and delicious food. Can really taste the grill flavours and the meat was very tender. Staff was also very friendly.
131,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent steak. Charcoal grill. Great atmosphere. Just be aware  that a a lit of seating involves eating off your knees.
132,Castell, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Certainly one of the better steak houses in Amsterdam and Wow my steak was amazing, we had a seat right by the bbq so could watch how much care went into cooking each steak, there was true love shown by the chef on each and every item he ‚Ä¶"

136,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best restaurant I've been since a long time. The meat was just awsome ! And the place is very cosy, it's just wonderful to eat near the fireplace. Highly recommended place if you come to visit Amsterdam !"
137,Castell, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Goede service en steak zoals je van de barbecue mag verwachten. GTSTe service and high quality meat. They should serve tabwater but unfortunately they don't. If they would I would give five stars
138,Castell, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Love the complimentary smoked bread. Love their steak which is perfect portion for ladies. Love the ribs. And love the attentive service. Hands down my best meal in Amsterdam.
139,Castell, 5 stars ,2 days ago,"This is by far the best T-bone steak around. Even late at night!
Be sure to make your reservations or be prepared to wait for a seat at the most comfortable bar in Amsterdam!"

I tried the angus steak, it is their speciality, had it in medium rare, but that ‚Ä¶"
141,Castell, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is amazing, but you need to be prepared to eat on your laps since you sit on a sofa and the tables are very low and far away. You get a tray with your dish. ‚Ä¶"
142,Castell, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The veal was not good, asked for medium and got well done, and this was the case for all the others that ordered veal in my groupe. The staff messed up two orders and used five minutes to bring us the wine list."
143,Castell, 2 stars ,7 months ago,This place is for spareribs and drinks. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend anything else.
144,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing ribs , great variety of steaks"

152,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Sitting around a fireplace enjoying delicious Rob's - what else can you ask for. Best ribs I have had in Amsterdam so far
153,Castell, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very good quality of food and drinks but idea of eating steak without table is a bit too nonstandard for me :)
154,Castell, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have no idea how I have never heard of this place, but it remains unaffected by the tourists and the money grab to catch them. Highly recommend it. They grill any type of meat perfectly...."
155,Castell, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"What/if I ever come back, I will absolutely come back. 1 of the best steaks I have had. Our waitress was so helpful and friendly. Also very good English."
156,Castell, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Very good steak. You have to eat on your lap. Best is to go as a big group and occupy one of the couches. Reservation is a must!
157,Castell, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very tasty ribs with nice dark beer.
158,Castell, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"simply the best steak in amsterdam, grilled in charcoal. great meat quality and good wine selection. the spare ribs are also amazing!"

160,Castell, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Still the best steak house in Europe.  Been eating here for nearly 10 years now and still perfect black and blue steak every time! Can't wait for my next one!
161,Castell, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Ribs were fantastic!  Every time I visit Amsterdam this is one of my 'go to' restaurants. It can be a little strange sitting around a giant coffee table breaking bread with strangers, but the food makes it worth it."
162,Castell, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The best steak, the best place to sit at the fireplace, the best service we have had in Amsterdam and overall just a place to come back!"

165,Castell, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice steaks, but personally i don't like 'vintage' couches and a plate on your knees for diner. And i would like more vegetables and the ability to order fries with my meal."
166,Castell, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Dark circa 1970 restaurant with nice service and friendly local feel. Eating at the bar is best as otherwise your eating with plates on your lap at the fire pits. Although that may be the charm.
167,Castell, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I have been to this place twice and I am definitely not going again. The staff is very arrogant and they are not even listening to the customer carefully. Luckily, this is not the only place to have steak in town."

173,Castell, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Very overrated. Ribs were quite dry. Steak was pretty bad as well. It was one of the hardest steak I have ever eaten.
174,Castell, 5 stars ,6 years ago,The best steak restaurant. Period. Try the prime rib for a fatty steak or the spare ribs for a juicy tender taste. Only steak restaurant which made me smile every single time.
175,Castell, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent concept. Nice place. Good helpful staff. Really nice food i must admit. Eat on your lap. No tables. Expensive parking.

180,Castell, 4 stars ,9 years ago,The best ribs I ever had! I go there 3 times a week when I'm in Amsterdam! You need a reservation to eat inside.

185,Castell, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Tough and tasteless meat. And at a high price! What happened to this place, it was good before and now such a disappointment. They ask 29 euro for a cheap cut of meat badly made?!!"
186,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best ribs in town!
187,Castell, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went back for the first time in 25 years and it was exactly as I remember! AMAZING! Great food, great service, 70‚Äôs interior!"
