3,Festina Lente, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The sandwich we ordered was good but nothing special. I liked the old atmosphere of the place but when we were there it took too long for a staff to come take our order and get the bills. Unfortunately we didn’t feel that welcome here. Probably it’s a good place for regular customers but not for passers like us.

I sat at a table inside where we could see the canals, although the have outside seats as well.
