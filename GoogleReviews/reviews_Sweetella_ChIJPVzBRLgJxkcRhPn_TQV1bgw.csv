0,Sweetella, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Churros are amazing! Really fresh, soft and warm and with nutella are delicious. Waffles are very good too. Totally recommended!"
1,Sweetella, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Crepe was nice and very filling but then again how can anybody go wrong with Nutella.
Prices can add up quick if you are not careful with the toppings €10 for a crepe …"
2,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to go if you have a sweet tooth! The owner/ manager seems to always be in a great mood and will throw you a great party!! They mainly have: poffertjes (small fluffy Dutch pancakes) waffles and churros with a plethora of toppings to choose from!  We really enjoyed our dessert after a day in Amsterdam !
3,Sweetella, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I visited this place in August 2017 looking for some ice cream. I got more than I bargained for however! I was about to order a double waffle and the friendly staff kindly advised it is big and instead they’ll make me something more …
4,Sweetella, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Perfect as usual. Great to be back x
5,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quality food and service. They have a selection is crepes, churros etc. All of which you can customise. The customer service is outstanding, feels like a small club. They blow smoke and throw sweets around. The food is just so big and filling. Visited twice during my stay."
6,Sweetella, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great waffles and very friendly ataff!
7,Sweetella, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Funky small dessert parlour. Very narrow entrance. Staff are dressed as characters. Desserts are ok, nothing wow. Expensive."
8,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"B e s t place in Ams if you are craving something sweet. The desserts were 10/10 - super sweet and tasty. Had Caramel Special waffles there. Very good waffle base served with caramel sauce, Twix, nougat, ice cream and whipped cream. …"
9,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is a piece of waffle from heaven. The deserts are customizable and they have a lot of topping and fresh fruit to add to your favorite type of dessert!
10,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I came back 3 times day after day, all the other shops with sweet came nothing compared to this store.  The stuff tha works there is amazing and so friendly and nice ."
11,Sweetella, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Very expensive .. you even need to pay for the chocolate on the crêpe! The plain crepe is just dough and sugar without anything..
12,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place, friendly Italian staff, plates well presented, amazing deserts with as much chocolate as you can have, loud music which for me is not a problem. Nutella and Banana Crepe, Nutella Churros (Pictured)."
13,Sweetella, 1 star ,6 months ago,"I wish there was a zero. The worst pancacke I tried not only in Amsterdam, but my whole life. Very dry and very little chocolate.Maybe it was good before, but now it is very bad."
14,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great, sweet food and really awesome staff.
This is my go-to place for sweet stuff like waffles, crepes, shakes etc."
15,Sweetella, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"If you like Vegas or the movie Coyote Ugly, you'll like this place. Think people pouring whip cream and toppings in your mouth. These guys clearly have fun at their jobs, which is great for party people, somewhat less appealing for people like me. But it's definitely worth a visit."
16,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Wafels, Pancakes and Churros in Amsterdam! Very nice people working there! I recommend you this location!!!"
17,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you order stairway to heaven, you get the whole show with lights and music, hilarious"
18,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing sweet experience! Absolute must for every guest of the city, part of its crazy athmosphere and be sure - you will be telling your grandchildren about it 😁😁 customer service is from a different planet!! Make sure to order one of the special plates to share to experience an exclusive serving show!! 🤩🤩🤩"
19,Sweetella, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very tasty and good service
The crepe is delicious"
20,Sweetella, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Friendly staff. Terrible portions. But nice food. Milkshakes are very thin. Crepes and waffles were nice
21,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"You like sweet? You like ice creams? Than this is a place to be. Very enthusiastic and cheerful staff, and the menu has loads of mouth watering desserts and ice creams. Also you can customise them."
22,Sweetella, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best in presentation and service! Great atmosphere and delicious food
23,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you're looking for the best ice cream and waffles in amsterdam, this is where you should go. :)"
24,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good sweets and treats and presentation. Would highly recommend checking it out!
25,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely Dutch pancakes ☺️ quick and friendly service and the portions are very filling!!
26,Sweetella, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Super friendly staff, keep making you laugh, waffle is nice and price is acceptable."
27,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not only were the mini pancakes delicious, the staff were hilarious! Such a great small restaurant with really tasty desserts. It's worth paying a little bit more when the food tastes this great and there's a really wide variety of toppings you can opt for. Would definitely go again!"
28,Sweetella, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Super sweet! Super tasty! Super expensive! Very nice personel
29,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Easily the best little sweet snack shop we've ever been in.
The guys there are absolutely crazy and they had us in stitches laughing.
We only went in for a couple of waffles and it turned into one of the most …"
30,Sweetella, 1 star ,7 months ago,Walked there 15 minutes based on good reviews. Closed when they’re supposed to be open. No signs indicating why. Very disappointing.
31,Sweetella, 3 stars ,a year ago,The ice-cream and sorbet were relatively inexpensive but the mango sorbet had a weird aftertaste. I would also like some dairy-free options for milkshakes etc. My partner did enjoy his milkshake though 😊
32,Sweetella, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We used to LOVE this place because they had gluten free batter and a molten cake! Super rare find for my Celiac husband. When we came back this year they no longer offered anything gluten free :( hugest bummer as that was our draw to the …
33,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very very very tasty crepes and sweets. Incredible.
34,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I’ve visited Amsterdam twice and each time I visited Sweetella/Sweetness. Every experience in the restaurant was different and was amazing. I would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for a sweet treat and just a good time. …
35,Sweetella, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Nice staff, but we paid 20 euros for two simple waffles with a small topping on it. Totally not worth.
Also, avoid the take-away: they will just give a piece of rigid paper, and the ice-cream will melt and fall all over the place."
36,Sweetella, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly polite staff great food
37,Sweetella, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Really tasty really overpriced if you opt for the “family size”
Very tasty but not 60 euro tasty"
38,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So delicious! The staff was very friendly and helpful; upon finding out my husband has Celiac (gluten free) the immediately presented us with options. He was able to get a gluten free lava cake that was delicious and doubly wonderful as we …
39,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best place for crepes ever!!! Insisted on going there a second time because of how lovely Super Mario and Ana are!! Amazing memory to our Amsterdam trip!! We love you Sweetella, Mario and Ana ❤️"
40,Sweetella, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The stroopwafel was very disappointing. It was fresh but crunchy (not soft as I expected) and the caramel was just brushed on top not between two layers and it was heavily dusted in icing sugar. On the other hand the ice cream was quite good.
41,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very small place and a bit crowded sometimes but delicious fresh hot waffle with whatever toppings you want and a very fun staff. Crazy Mike made a show of someone’s dessert that was great to watch!
42,Sweetella, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went in for a Nutella crêpe and it was really nice. Was a bit thick for my liking but if that's how you like them this is the place for you! Really enjoyed the banter from the staff and they were super fun and quick to serve. Great service, nice cozy place for a late night snack."
43,Sweetella, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing icecream, price and extremely friendly and fun staff!"
44,Sweetella, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really nice place and very kind staff. The dishes are delicious.
45,Sweetella, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff were awesome. The waffle I ordered not so much, especially for the price. I got a pretty simple single waffle - lemon, blueberries and whip cream. The lemon/blueberries part was perfect; the waffle itself tasted undercooked or something."
46,Sweetella, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Came after dinner to get a waffle. Staff were friendly and joked around with us and asked where we were from. Music was good and they played some funny jokes. Not 5 starts because food did take a while to come but all in all a good experience and would go back!
47,Sweetella, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great dessert on everything chocolate. Good size portion as well with reasonable price. Mixture of local of tourist visiting. Staff were friendly but busy with packing things. There was a handyman fixing things and flirting with the girls …
48,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is perhaps the best dessert I’ve ever had in my life (and trust me I’ve had MANY.) I literally came back every night I was in Amsterdam, one day twice. I’ve never before seen a dessert mastered so excellently. True perfection. Would rate 200/5"
49,Sweetella, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Well it looks fancy, staff were of high energy and made you feel welcome. However, thats all. Waffle was just good, i dont think its how a good Dutch waffle tastes like. Definitely only applicable to tourists. I doubt that a local will go …"
50,Sweetella, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I have never left a 1 star review for anything before but this place was a really bad experience. I went there because of the good reviews but was really disappointed. The music was *extremely* loud (club level volume), making it impossible …"
51,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have visited with my girlfriend. They are serving with personal show, it was very funny :)"
52,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First off, this shop is a little hole in the wall in the Red Light District, so if you blink you’ll miss it! We got one of the specials, Three Steps to Heaven, and let me tell you...oh my gosh was it good! 100% would recommend! Since it’s a …"
53,Sweetella, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best crepes and waffles in Amsterdam. The people working there are always smiling. This time was my fifth visit in five times to Amsterdam
54,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely Fantastic crepes !! Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish !!
55,Sweetella, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Went here for something sweet with my wife and 3 kids aged 9, 11, 13.

Staff suggested they create us something amazing, rather than ordering off the …"
56,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Sweet and delicious. Nothing for the beach body, but so good.
Churros, ice cream and waffles, in this small bistro is a good atmosphere, nice employees and delicious sweetness."
57,Sweetella, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The staff seems to enjoy their work. I can't find anything else positive. Music is very loud (i mean Club level). The staff hardly seems to notice you. If they do, they mess up the order. I waited 15 Minuten for my tea to arrive just to …"
58,Sweetella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"delicious waffles!!! they have cool ice cream flavours like kinder bueno and Ferrero rocher, all at a reasonable price ^^
staff are super friendly and welcoming as well, thank you!!!"
59,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice small and cute place! The waiter was kind and helpful.
60,Sweetella, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very rude service. The food was good but not worth the price, BUT I do see why it is expensive. Quite the experience we had. We ordered a double waffle and after waiting a seemingly long time, Fireball by Pitbull started playing and the …"
61,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place , good sweets"
62,Sweetella, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Offers the best sweets in Amsterdam. The service is awesome and the people who work here are really funny and lovely. This place is super awesome and crazy. You will have a great experience in Sweetella
63,Sweetella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Having the obligatory traditional waffle (which was delicious) turned into quite a show when the two servers dimmed the lights, donned facemasks and served the table next to us to the tune of Thriller, setting alight clouds of castor sugar. If you're in a big group willing to share, order the big platter and get the show!"
64,Sweetella, 1 star ,4 years ago,Service was awful. Waited for 40 minutes for a hot chocolate after they forgot about it. I also had to tell them my order 3 times because the employees were busy socializing. The music was loud and employees were throwing chairs and cups. At one point they were throwing powdered sugar and m&ms at customers.
65,Sweetella, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing crepes and waffles, I was really dreaming with my eyes open when I started eating my crepe. Super nice, a lot of choices, and super kind staff. Very recommended!"
66,Sweetella, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Cheerful and welcoming atmosphere, but please don't add extra sugar on churros with Nutella and powdered sugar 😛 Definitely an overload and doesn't make them taste better."
67,Sweetella, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Delicious waffles, and super funny staff."
68,Sweetella, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicella ! Friendly staff and yummy crepes
69,Sweetella, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I don’t know, probably my experience was average at best because it was so crowded that day, waiters were under a lot of pressure but they still were doing their best to be nice and I appreciate that though, cute if you like fireworks in …"
