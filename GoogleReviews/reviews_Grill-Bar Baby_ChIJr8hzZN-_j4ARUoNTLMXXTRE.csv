0,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Awesome and good food ! Highly recommended the Curry toast ( this could quite spicy for people whom are not use to spicy food ) & Malaysian style fried vermicelli! Good quality food with reasonable price and we ordered a lot of food. Staffs are efficient, food & drinks served without being waiting long. I will definitely visit again!"
1,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I recommend the Cajun mussels.  They were delicious.  Nice selection of skewered meats and seafood as well.  Finally, the service was excellent!  Very polite and efficient.  The food comes out FAST."
2,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"All the foods were great! No disappointment at all.
My favorite is the pork belly skewers, beef tongue was soft (sweet though), oyster and mussels was fresh. ‚Ä¶"
3,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great place to come hang out with drinks and food. They have fairly decent prices for the drinks and pitchers.
I've tried a variety of their skewers and their calamari. No complaints here and they definitely go well with whatever you're drinking."
4,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Looking for a quick, delicious snack or meal? This place has you covered. The wagyu skewers are nice and tender, and I highly recommend the curry chicken toast. The curry sauce is really tasty and packs some heat, and the chicken is juicy ‚Ä¶"
5,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,a year ago,"For my personal favorite at Bar bay grill is the Seafood fried vermicelli È¶¨‰æÜË•ø‰∫ûÊµ∑ÈÆÆÁÇíÁ±≥Á≤â, taste very good and the portion is big(for me).

6,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Really good food. We ordered the wagyu skewer, takoyaki, mussels, and the Curry Bread. The Curry Bread in particular was really good. The chicken and potatoes had great flavor thanks to the curry sauce and the bread itself was amazing when ‚Ä¶"
7,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff and delicious oysters - such a good deal on Tuesdays & Wednesdays ($1 oysters) !

9,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such great food!  Had the beef, chicken, lamb, and pork belly skewers.  All were soo good.  Also had the garlic edamame, with some spice.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  The service was great also! I would also like to say That ‚Ä¶"
10,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great food and authentic Asian!
11,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Great service. They only do outdoor seating. They used to give discount for beer when warrior wins. Not sure if they still do that. Excellent bbq skewers in good price. This is drinking place with snacks kind of place. Love their draft ‚Ä¶
12,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good and less expensive alternative to authentic Japanese grill / yakitori type places.  They have an interesting and unique selection of beer and saki on the menu. Clean and relaxing. Noise level can get high, but it's a sports bar after all."
13,Grill-Bar Baby, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Can only dine outside and the sunshine was too much, so we had to move our tables several times. The mini hotpot materials were kinda cheap. However, the oyster was good üëç"
14,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice hangout! Bar fare included some skewers and it reminded me of college days hanging out in a cheap watering hole with street vendors nearby hawking different animal parts in skewers cooked over open grills.
15,Grill-Bar Baby, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Qthe quality of yakitori is OK,  dollar oyster on Tue and we'd was good"

19,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stopped in Bar Bay Grill for the first time. The hostess and staff were very friendly and helpful in explaining the different types of food on the menu. We ordered al la carte. Fresh oysters, which were excellent, chicken wings and grilled ‚Ä¶"
20,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food in this place is amazing!!
I went with some friends and we had an amazing time. The hole squid was delicious!! And the gyozas too. Definitely my favourites. ‚Ä¶"

23,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tonight, my first time at Bar Bay Grill was an awesome experience! Very unique, amazing and affordable food! It's now on my short list of favorite places to eat. Having grown up in Union City, I'm very proud that they have called this home."
24,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Bar Bay Grill a place to meet up with friends and catch up. They have all kinds of drinks and food. Skewers are usually what I get. They have chicken hearts and chicken gizzards skewers. Food are on point and they have more to offer. ‚Ä¶
25,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,a year ago,I really really love their fry noodles and rice. It tastes like the street food in China. Best in the Bay Area.
26,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The was better than ok. It's not a good place to bring kids. It has small plates to share. They serve all kinds of alcohol. There are a bunch of people smoking outside.  The place is a little loud. They are open late. No outdoor seating.  I didn't notice any handicap seating.  It's a trendy bar.
27,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I loved this place! I would highly recommend the chicken heart and the chicken curry
28,Grill-Bar Baby, 1 star ,3 years ago,"First the food took forever, and second the food wasn't great. The scallops were over spiced, the garlic fries had pieces of garlic so large the garlic didn't stay on the fries, the salad tasted wrong like they put the wrong dressing, the ‚Ä¶"
29,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Awesome customer service & friendly.

Our party had the curry toast, grilled squid, edamame, grilled chicken skin. ‚Ä¶"
30,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is a gem. The staff are really nice and a lot of fun. I stopped by on New Year's to get a little food before going out to the bars, they threw party for everyone there and I had the most fun I've ever had at a restaurant."
31,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ambience and geared towards sports fans given the pennants, TV'S (lots) and darkened interior. Service is mediocre and just feels like any other restaurant, not like a sports bar or for hanging out to watch the game. It is good for ‚Ä¶"
32,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Bar Bay Grill is one of my favorite places to come to watch sports. Food is delicious, but I took off a star because the food is small portions, and way overpriced. The customer service is hit-or-miss though. I'll still come her though because I love the overpriced food."
33,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"We came here right when they open at 1pm. Only 3 tables the entire time we dine here, but service was SLOW, maybe because they only had one person serving. Three tables, yet they still managed to give our order to another table. Food and drink quality wise is decent. I would give it a 4 for the oysters. 3 for the service."
34,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic ambience and super amiable service. The food was crisp and yummy. Will absolutely recommend this restaurant to others. Affordable rates and big meals. Great work.
35,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great experience. We actually planned to only stop in for a drink before heading elsewhere for dinner, but when I saw the yakitori options we were there for the night. Beware of those double and triple IPAs though, they'll sneak up on you."
36,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beef ribs and chicken wings were the best. Wouldn‚Äôt order the garlic edamame (soaked in oil) or the wagyu beef stick (over cooked tough and dry as a result) Overall had a good time, nice ambiance good prices."
37,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very Elegant....Staff is super professional & attends to your need's very quickly. The music is carefully selected by them & is awesome!! Thank you so much for having this establishment in my neighborhood. By the way, Calvin is very good at what he does."

41,Grill-Bar Baby, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty but that's about it....garlic fries that were just fried with garlic shavings and no garlic flavor, soggy fried calamari with extra sweet thick honey mustard sauce, BBQ wings with soft skin that looks like the skin was undercooked ‚Ä¶"
42,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This place has great happy hour(s!) Sunday through Thursday after 930pm and everyday before 6! Also, if you eat/drink during a Warriors game and they win, your drinks are half off!"
43,Grill-Bar Baby, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I had higher expectations of this place. When  i asked questions to the hostess/waiter about the items in the menu she was bit brusque about answering them. I ordered from the skewer menu: fish tofu, bacon asparagus and a strip of chicken ‚Ä¶"
44,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food and great for watching the Warriors play!  The staff is always friendly - it feels very welcoming going there.  This is a place we go to regularly :)!
45,Grill-Bar Baby, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I'm torn between giving 5 stars or 2. The fiance and I would come once every two weeks and we LOVED it. Dollar oysters during HH? Totally down for that!! Until the the one day we came home and my fiancee started throwing everything up. She ‚Ä¶
46,Grill-Bar Baby, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I've been 3 times, always with a party of 8-10 because we'd go after work. Each time, the food was good but the music was so loud we could only hear the people immediately next to us. Terrible place to go with a group. Avoid it if you have more than 2 friends."
47,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice sports bar and great staff. Very good atmosphere for group to drink n dine and even catch a game or two. Great selections from meat to seafood and bar food.

49,Grill-Bar Baby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A pitcher of grapefruit shandy and their grilled skewers are the perfect wind down meal. They also have some interesting and yummy seafood specials.
50,Grill-Bar Baby, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This place is look different with Yelp picture

51,Grill-Bar Baby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,My girlfriend and I love coming here whenever we want several small appetizers vs a huge main entree. Our goto orders are the corn cheese and garlic butter oysters.

61,Grill-Bar Baby, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"If you don't like electric music, don't go to this restaurant. They play music from EDC and other similar events super loudly and you had to yell to let another person hear you. Food was so so."
