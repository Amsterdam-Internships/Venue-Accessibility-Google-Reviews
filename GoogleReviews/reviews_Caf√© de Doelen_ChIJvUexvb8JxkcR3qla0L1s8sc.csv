28,Caf√© de Doelen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,She seemed short with me for asking what they have on thier burgers. The burger taste is not the same as North American burger. Very Strong taste.

34,Caf√© de Doelen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place was perfect for a quick beer. They have Amstel beer too!!! It's right on the corner so if you sit near the door you can see the iconic bridge outside. It's the perfect place for a quick drink when you are on the move in the city.

48,Caf√© de Doelen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, nice 'healthy sandwich', good coffee, nice service.
