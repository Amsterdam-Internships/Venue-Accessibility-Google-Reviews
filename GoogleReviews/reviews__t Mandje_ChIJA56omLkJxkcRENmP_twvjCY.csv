6,'t Mandje, 1 star ,2 years ago,We went back tonight because it was a lot of fun a few nights ago. Unfortunately the bartender working there tonight decided to ignore us. We ended up leaving without even getting a drink. I hope the owner reads this post.
7,'t Mandje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Gay bar with a rich history. If I'm not wrong, this was one of the first gay bars in Amsterdam. It's a cosy little place with lots of nooks to have conversations in and to soak in its history. The energy is always buzzing in this place. ‚Ä¶"
8,'t Mandje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really fun atmosphere here. Great place to hangout and have a drink. The prices are good and the bartender is nice. It is just a bit small, when it gets busy it can be hard to find a table."
9,'t Mandje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Old classic bar on the Zeedijk. Typical lesbian that keeps the atmosphere quite authentic and really dutch. This last part you really need to be able like it. You can easy dance and meet new ppl. Mixed crowds.

16,'t Mandje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Stumbled in there by chance. Very interesting interior. Supposedly one of the oldest bars in Amsterdam. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the bar and the district.
17,'t Mandje, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"The oldest gaybar in town! Nice atmosphere, nice people.
The bar started in 1927 by Bet van Beeren, a lesbian who thought al people where equal. ‚Ä¶"
18,'t Mandje, 5 stars ,5 years ago,First gay and lesbian caf√© of the world. Their sing-a-longs are hilarious and 'gezellig' with locals and a lot of lesbians. They organise diners with 'stamppot'; typical Dutch winter specials.

24,'t Mandje, 1 star ,2 years ago,Waited 10 minutes for a drink and nothing.  Too many people and not enough bar tenders.  Don‚Äôt waste your time.
25,'t Mandje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow, what a great place.  If you want great energy, a bartender that double times as as a jack of all trades MASTER of ALL, this is the place."
