0,De Belg, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our favorite spot for fries and chicken bites! These fries were with curry sauce and onions. So amazing. Highly recommend this place, especially those chicken bites! Love love love. Friendly staff too!"
1,De Belg, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best fries that I had in Amsterdam I tried a couple places but this one hits the spot. You have to try patatje oorlog with sat√® saus you want regret it but to people with allergy do not try the sat√® saus it is with peanuts. Try the other sauces.
2,De Belg, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very busy store in Amsterdam. The fries were hot and salty which was great. Fast service considering the size of the line. Multiple different sauces available to choose from. ‚Ç¨3 for small ‚Ç¨4 for medium and ‚Ç¨5 for large. Sauces cost extra starting at 80cents.
3,De Belg, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This stand has the best fries! Made fresh to order and you can add a variety of sauces. We mixed cheese and bbq and it was delicious.
4,De Belg, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My friend ordered truffle mayo and the guy gave her ketchup + mayo, charged her more and did not want to take it back for the correct order after she asked politely. Horrible service, they do not care about the customer. Try Vlaamse Frites, A+ compared to these losers."
5,De Belg, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Small, but expensive portions. The fries are nothing special. But then, what can you expect in the middle of the tourist area. I am Dutch, from a nearby city with less tourists. But with so much better and cheaper street food."
6,De Belg, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly workers, great fries! I got a medium with truffle mayo ü§§"
7,De Belg, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is amazing. Great fries and awesome workers. Let me tell you a story. One day I visited De belg with my last five euros in hand. I was yearning for some good quality fries. I purchased the lil kleine with a simple joppie sauce. ‚Ä¶
8,De Belg, 1 star ,3 years ago,The best in the whole city. Confirmed! But just a had a problem recently so I'm forced to change my review. ‚Ä¶
9,De Belg, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Bad experience... Was sure handed him5.20 euros for a medium sized fries with sauce...the man insisted that i gave him 3.70 euros..
