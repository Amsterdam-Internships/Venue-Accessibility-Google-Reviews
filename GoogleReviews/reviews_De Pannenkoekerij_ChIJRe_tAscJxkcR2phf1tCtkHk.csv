1,De Pannenkoekerij, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best waffles in dam! Really nice staff, and good coffee"
2,De Pannenkoekerij, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Two friendly guys run this place. Upstairs is cosy and welcoming with nice music (unlike some places we've been this weekend where they insist on techno blasting out). Pancakes are delicious and worth seeking out. On a little back road and not heaving with people. Recommend.
3,De Pannenkoekerij, 1 star ,3 years ago,"On the menu, I was attracted by their ""pancakes with Nutella"".
How surprised I was when my plate comes: one single cr√™pe with Nutella and some icing sugar. And I payed 8,50‚Ç¨ for it. Totally not worth it. ‚Ä¶"
