0,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Lovely and quiet place. I enjoyed my time here as its not crowded, and we sat outside. The carrot cake was too sugary for me, I ate more than half of it because I like nuts. The coffee was good, the workers were polite and it was cheap compared to some other cafes. Would recommend it."

2,Caffe Il Momento, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Awesome brownie. The espresso for us is too acidic but the quality should be great. This is definitely not what you get in Italy what I saw in other comments this is typical coffee Dutch import.
For Italian coffee you go somewhere else..."
3,Caffe Il Momento, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Nice espresso and a lovely venue to go to. Nice interieur or sitting on the terrace. Not the high accidity (good roasted beans here ... üòâ)

35,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Momento is just off of a bustling area, offering delicious coffee and pastries with just a little bit of seating if you're lucky enough to time it right. If you're wandering the neighborhood, I would suggest stopping in for some friendly service, some caffeine, and a nut bar to fuel you to your next stop."
36,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such a cute place near Central Amsterdam. The atmosphere was just perfect.
37,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Cappuccino and croissant are amazing! Baristas are very friendly as well.
38,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very welcoming, baring in mind it is near to the centre of Amsterdam it has reasonably priced coffee. The coffee is good quality and they have a range of different extras available for free such as sugar syrup, nutmeg and cinnamon, items ‚Ä¶"
39,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, very good coffee."
40,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Every single person that works here is awesome!  They have delicious drinks and baked goods.  And if you want some coffee making gear for home, they've got a nice selection.  It's a great place to stop for coffee in the center of town."
41,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Consistently good coffee and baked treats. In my top three fave cafes in Amsterdam (for quality of coffee).
Staff are always lovely and cheerful - well worth a visit, but keep in mind there isn't a substantial food menu if you're super hungry."
42,Caffe Il Momento, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice cafe with tasty coffee & lovely atmosphere.
43,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent spot for amazing espresso drinks. Friendly staff. I wish the four chairs in the back had electrical sockets for chargers but thats a small complaint. The bathroom is pretty bad though.
44,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Delicious coffee, friendly staff, cozy ambiance, picturesque location in Amsterdam's canal district."
45,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic coffee taste, Barista knows what she‚Äôs doing, a very pleasant coffee experience! Banana bread was, one of a kind, not really my favourite recepe but well prepared."
46,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great staff and good coffee. Nice cake!
47,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great coffee at the great small place!
48,Caffe Il Momento, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Average cafe for Amsterdam. Regular coffee is 2.5‚Ç¨ to start, and most of its pastries which aren't baked inhouse start at 3‚Ç¨. There aren't any comfy chairs so it's not really a cafe to stay long and work. Staff was nice and the cafe is clean and cozy, but if you want to hang out for a while I think there are better places nearby."
49,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Since I found this place I‚Äôve visited once a day for a coffee.  They have fresh milk (not uht), as well as almond and oat milk (probably also soy but I didn‚Äôt really pay attention). They make a consistently good coffee."
50,Caffe Il Momento, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Coffee: top notch! Perfect barista coffee and worth the ‚Ç¨. Service: :( no smile or even acknowledgement of the guests, which has the potential of really taking the charm of the small grachten-caf√© away. Imagine what you could do with well-rounded coffee and a smiling person that makes it just for you!"
51,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice and cozy coffee place, centrally located."
52,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great service, nice vibe and nice flat white."
53,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious beans, their expresso is some of the best we had during our visit. Could have more pastry options, we didn‚Äôt see anything savory while visiting but the coffee is worth coming back for."
54,Caffe Il Momento, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I had high hopes for this place but it's just a run of the mill cafe. I couldn't get in with a pram the first time I went by which I took as a good sign it was so busy. I went back later and had an average espresso. No filter or pour over options which was disappointing.
55,Caffe Il Momento, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Uncomfortable place with terrible decor. The staff weren't what I'd call pleasant, with an aura of arrogance about them.
As for the coffee, I asked for an espresso and paid ‚Ç¨2 for only a few drops of ‚Ä¶"
56,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a really good place to have a quiet moment, good coffee and cake. They have a small bench outside overlooking canal and street. I come here when I need to rethink and make some new plans."
57,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Marvelous coffee! Also, they have a pretty good variety of cakes and other sweets which I advise you to try. The place is very welcoming and the staff is super friendly and you can ask for advice if you are not decided what to choose."
58,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best flat white in Amsterdam. Flavor was strong but smooth and complex. Staff was warm and knew their coffee. Excellent location.
59,Caffe Il Momento, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best coffees in Amsterdam. Although it is a bit pricy it makes up with the quality. Nice to visit on a sunny day, as there is cosy square on front of the cafe. Toilet is dirty."
60,Caffe Il Momento, 1 star ,2 years ago,Disappointing coffee (unfairly treated beans by 'Lot 61') in a 'cheap' Barista-like set. Pitty that an almost perfect crumble berry tart cannot change the whole picture.
61,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Located on the canals close to the Anne Frank Museum. Il Momento is a specialty coffee bar for single roasted beans and very good coffee. Small patio which is perfect for people watching! Cool industrial interior design.
62,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good coffee, relaxed ambience. Great place to relax."
63,Caffe Il Momento, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Take a little time out from busy Amsterdam to enjoy a little tart.  Petit g√¢teau.   Awesome little tarts with supreme fillings. All made fresh on-site, if you are lucky you will be in when they open the oven and the smell fils the cafe."
64,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Some of the best coffee I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam. Not a lot of places to sit so not a great cafe to work in but perfect to have a cappuccino and read a while.

66,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful coffee , good price and nice views"

69,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good ambiance, friendly staff and good quality coffee. Best cappuccino in town, perfectly paired with a giant chocolate cookie."
70,Caffe Il Momento, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Not as good as I remember, best thing is the location. Also they use Alpro oat milk which is no good."
71,Caffe Il Momento, 4 stars ,a year ago,"A peaceful patch in the middle of a normally bustling city, with some sun on it in the morning.  Good coffee (but no decaf)."
72,Caffe Il Momento, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Top coffee
73,Caffe Il Momento, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Appalling; came here for a couple of coffees mid-morning, waited at our table while half a dozen people who came in after us were served. When we queried this, we were told they had lost our order (they weren't busy, hard to believe they ‚Ä¶"
74,Caffe Il Momento, 1 star ,4 years ago,"One of the staff members had forgotten his deodorant. Very unpleasant. Coffee is ok, but couldn't enjoy anymore. Also missing comfortable chairs."
