0,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice caffes and atmosphere. Not to much to eat here and even if you want to sit down, you have to order inside."
1,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We absolutely LOVE this place. We visit Vondelpark Park on our holiday to Amsterdam every year and our visit is never complete without a lovely afternoon spent at this cafe! …
2,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautifully located in Vondelpark in Amsterdam. Surrounded by lush green views and a pond/ canal (We visited in springtime). Importantly, a big play area for kids with plenty outdoor seating. There was also a bouncy castle and other little …"
3,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We were hungry and walking through the park when we came across this place. The food was delicious, nice coffee. Very polite girl serving us. Recommending this was for a breakfast/ lunch or just a quick meal. It's worth it!"
4,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Don’t come for the food, but they have a quiet balcony and a super nice playground. Great place for kids!"

9,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"An oasis in the middle of the gorgeous Vondelpark, where you can grab a bite or drink something sitting on a fantastic huge terrace close to the water. It's a self service but well organized and quite fast. The personnel are super friendly …"

12,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Beautiful laid-back café in the heart of Vondelpark. It has a beautiful view over a small water body and so much greenery all around it. It's where I meet people every now and then. It's a good place to socialize, but not a place where you can sit quietly with laptop and get things done."
13,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super gezellige plekje waarin je uitrusten kunt. It has some tables outside and the view, next to the artificial lake, is simply fantastic. It's self service so you have to go inside to order.  The staff is really friendly and they are …"

15,Groot Melkhuis, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Unfriendly staff. Fast food, quite expensive for offered quality. After a small accident my son had in a toilet I was forced to clean the toilet in front of other visitors (for using which I paid, for a minute). Beautiful spot in a park, but doesn’t worth visiting really."
16,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place in the middle of vondelpark. It could not be in a better situation.

20,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,a year ago,It was perfect on a rainy day 09-09-2020. I even saw a famous Dutch fashion couturier from the old Royal gang. Central Park Boat house in Amsterdam
21,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"A little bit oldfashioned place, there is plastic everywhere, and you have to order inside. The fries I had were way too oily and I didn't feel very good after them. But still, the surroundings are nice and you can sit outside even without ordering, nobody cares."
22,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Self sevice cafe. Lovely outdoor seating and decent food.
23,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Nice place to go sit outside on the terrace, next to the water and watch the world passing by. There is a self-service system for  getting food and drinks. Bathroom available via a side-entrance and cost less than €1 per person."

25,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Pet friendly cafe at vondelpark. The place is a very nice alternative if you are tired of crowded cafes in this same area. Staff is friendly and vondelpark is a must go if you are in vacation here at amsterdam. Prices are fair considering the area but dont expect miracles, a oat mil cafe latte is €4,5."
26,Groot Melkhuis, 1 star ,4 years ago,beautiful setting for a self service cafe in the vondel park but the cream of broccoli soup was the worst i ever had!

32,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,a year ago,Good for a quick drink! Great for children 👶
33,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,a year ago,The best feature of this place is the location in the Vondelpark. The food is rather basic and there is no table service. …
34,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is fine, staff are friendly. Great playground for kids of all ages. However, I will never understand why businesses charge customers to use the toilet (€1 for myself and my small child) who have already paid for lunch. I understand a …"
35,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Don't get the hamburger. It's not good.

38,Groot Melkhuis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful location, superb after a long walk through the park. Prices are a joke. Nearly 10 Euro for water. Otherwise would give 4/5 stars if they could improve on basic prices. Food I can understand. But when you want to buy a bottle of water it’s a bit excessive."
39,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"After walking around some tourist places and then scrolled half way around the park, this was a perfect place to stop and rest and have a cold beer.
The terrace is pretty and calming as you look over the water. …"
40,Groot Melkhuis, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Tourist trap. So many better places within easy walking distance. I'm not sure what need this place fills. Guess it'll be rebranded or updated soon, as it has such a great location but is so disappointing.  Kids playground in fenced area is a highlight."
41,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice location in the park. Ride there on your bike!
42,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Ok for food but caters for tourists and one time visitors so is not high on quality. Does decent coffee. No table service and when your order is ready it is announced over a very poor quality microphone and speakers. Has a good playground for kids and is on the water.
43,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,a year ago,It's park food. It was not the best meal I've ever had but it was very convenient and needed. The playground here is great for small kiddos.
44,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to sit and have drink. Quite a few places to sit outside and enjoy a afternoon in the park.
45,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice cafe along the river, quite a good spot to sit and take in the sights. We ordered just a drink each so can't comment on the food. We got two teas, being English the brand wasn't the location made up for it. Note you have to donate to a pot to use the toilets here"
46,Groot Melkhuis, 2 stars ,5 years ago,It is a beautiful place to sit. But a waitress seen us for sure and didn't ask us anything. We waited 10 minutes and nobody came to us. I seen one smart older local guy go help himself and brought himself and his wife some drinks. I seen …
47,Groot Melkhuis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Great for a quick coffee/tea facing the park. Charging customers for toilet is not ok though.
48,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"It says family friendly and could not be more spot on! Sometimes a bit crowded, but never had a problem finding a table. They have a medium size selection of food and snack, but a good variety in general. Kids will love it :)"
49,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good cost-effective selection of food. Craft beer selection. Nice quiet park location in the heart of the city. Friendly staff. Only downer is that bathroom is pay-only even for dining customers.
50,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful view
Self service is a little annoying especially since they're blasting the numbers for hot food over the whole Terrasse"
51,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Large playarea for kids, but all sandy so not so refreshing on a hot day. They have a variety of drinks, for parents and children,  to enjoy while the kids play."
52,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice Place and good food like snacks!
53,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Self service, pay at the counter sort of place. The food selection isn't that great but the drink selection more than makes up for it.  The prices arer expensive but the location is worth it. Sitting out on thee patio on a warm day is …"
54,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,a year ago,Always great to visit with friends and family. Have a great park for kids also nice menu and fast service in cafe. Highly recommended!
55,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Looks better on the outside where there's also a play park for kids. Even on a rainy day it was super crowded, although they keep closed without noticed on some days with bad weather. The convenience is if you're in the park and need a …"
56,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Perfect place for a lunch. Nice food and drinks. Try the Salomon sandwich !
57,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to stop for a drink and bite to eat while exploring Vondelpark. Service is slow unfortunately making for lengthy queues and a long wait to be served - sometimes 10 mins. Otherwise, all good and great seating area outside."
58,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice staff and good poffertjes :)
59,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"In short: Very nice location.

65,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food leaves something to be desired. But it has a cute lunchline system because this place is super busy at lunch. I'm guessing all day. There's lots of picnic tables outside, fronting views of Vondelpark. several playgrounds with nice …"
66,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the few cafés in Vondelpark, it has a very nice terrace and outdoor area next to the water. There's no service at the table and somehow I always felt that this place lacks of character and atmosphere."
67,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I met Chantal Jansen here.
That was pretty dope"
68,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place but not the best pan cakes
69,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful place. I loved it. Self service bar with delicous cake. You can sit next to the water and enjoy life. Great for children as well
70,Groot Melkhuis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Long queue, ending with a grumpy staff member who was unwilling to heat up a slice of cake due to how busy it was (saying she would have done it on a different day). With the prices they charge, the least they could do is have toilets available for their customers for free."
71,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"The reason to visit here is the location. In the middle of the park, tables next to the little canal, it has a great relaxing spot if the weather isn't too bad. It's self-service at the cashier, nothing special to offer in the menu. If you have kids, there is a playground at the back."
72,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A cosy place to sit back,pause and relax with a cup of coffee beside you.

Downside that had to pay to use the toilet where used it with family and the …"

77,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Big selection of coffee and tea, delicious dirty chai (although a bit pricy).
Also have toilet for 70 cents"
78,Groot Melkhuis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place in the park where you could make a stop if you are riding a bike, just take a sit, drink a coffee and the continue with your journey. High recommended, the place is beautiful and cheap."
79,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It served a purpose to have rest and a bite to eat.  The location is good and the food ok.  Staff on self service till was helpful and friendly.
80,Groot Melkhuis, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Playground, awesome! The restaurant itself, not so much. Terrible coffee, even more terrible plastic pancakes. I have no idea how you can bake a plastic pancake like that. So for the kids to play A+. But not for the pancakes and coffee."

84,Groot Melkhuis, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Absolute disaster. Food was bad and delivered late. Asked for a burger, waited 30 minutes and was told they forgot my request, so they were starting it then. Would have left but they ask you to queue and pay in advance."

88,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"great spot in vondelpark - especially if you have kids - there's a playground attached to it, with one way in, same way out - sit down, have a hot chocolate (order at the till), and let the kids loose"
89,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has mediocre coffee, poor service and vary bad cakes. The location is obviously magnificent, but the quality of the products needs to improve."
90,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Huge queues for buying food. If you want to have a spot on a sunny table, your buddy needs to stay out keeping the table, until you grab the food and drinks inside"

98,Groot Melkhuis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely setting with outdoor seating overlooking the park. Food also good but toilets *very* dirty
99,Groot Melkhuis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Always come here with good weather  to enjoy their fries while my son plays in their playground. Highly recommend.
