0,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,a week ago,Great 👍🏼 Restaurant take your  date and feel great 😊 Or you could eat like a sea queen or a king 👑 So have your trident ready for the ultimate and seafood 🦞
1,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Combo B. This pot was delicious. Go with the house special sauce with you level of spiciness. I felt like this was a great portion to share for 2 people 3 at max. Great experience and can't wait to try another pot
2,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,2 months ago,It was really good. I loved the flavors and the fries. It’s a better than other crab locations. There’s a lot of space and not super crowded. They have good kid options. Service was fast and friendly.
3,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Phenomenal! The service is great. The food is great. Especially the Mr. Crab sauce. I definitely will be back. In fact, I can't stop thinking about it."
4,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"My girlfriend and our friends got option d and c for the seafood boils. Had to have been good, because there was nothing left. I had some of the potatos and sausage, and they were amazing. Since seafood messes up my stomach, I got a chicken po-boy with extra sauce and cajun fries. 10/10."
5,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Came here Friday around 5pm. The food came quickly and tasted delicious. I ordered just king crab legs and got the Mr. Crab signature seasoning and they came out delicious. My fiancé got the combo B with Mr. Crab signature seasoning extra …
6,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very good!  Fast even though they are short staffed.  Probably having a problem getting people to come back to work like we are.  But they were still fast after we sat down.  Less than 10 minutes.  Everything in big steamed bag.  Paper on the table.  Fun
7,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Not only was my order wrong, but I went back the following day and they messed it up again. They forgot my butter the first day on top of not giving me the right seasoning on my crab. I go back 7/22 and they gave me spicy garlic butter …"
8,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,a month ago,That was too good 😂 let’s get the bill purrr. 10/10 fr and whoever was on aux was playing good music . Because when we walked in back to sleep played and then when we left check up on it played . Like okaaaaay mr crab we see you!!
9,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"This new restaurant located in the Super Walmart shopping center off of Truxel Road & Interstate 80, Sacramento, California. The food the BEST Seafood I have ever had! It is also the Freshest I have ever had. I have had clam chowder before, …"
10,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Firstly I want to say I was pleased with how clean the establishment was. Secondly, the customer service was top-tier! Everyone was so patient and polite. Especially my waiter - Giamaurie. He was so kind and attentive, he made me feel happy …"
11,Mr. Crab, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Service was pretty allll right.
Food was great. I ordered 1lb of shrimp in the bag. Love how they sauce the. I would definitely recommend."
12,Mr. Crab, 3 stars ,a year ago,The Staff is on point. Definitely lacking the quantity of meat inside the the snow crabs and their mr crab signature flavor is just a no go. Spicy level is pretty damn head itching sweaty hot.  Im sure theyll make improvements.
13,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Just ate here. Had high hopes for this place but was let down. Seasoning is not there and I got Cajun fries, my partner got regular and neither of us could tell the difference between the two. Deep fried and 0 flavor. Check was also brought to us literally 5 minutes into our meal..... big NOPE for us. Eat somewhere else."
14,Mr. Crab, 3 stars ,9 months ago,Wifey liked the shrimp 🦐 but the po boy soft tail lobster 🦞 was nothing to me. The Cajun fries 🍟 were ok and the sausage was average. Highly doubt I’ll be coming back here after paying over $60 and being dissatisfied. Perhaps 🤔 other …
15,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,2 months ago,We love the food a lot accept one small animal in the sauce but we eat everything else. We were 7 people and we choose the messy mix so good 😊 we paid 260$ with drink 🥤 for everyone. We really enjoyed it yesterday and we will do it again …
16,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Our waitress is awesome foods are very delicious but its over seasoning.. kinda salty but over its very good..
17,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,6 months ago,"When I got there, 2 employees did not have their masks over their noses. I ordered 2lbs. of crab. They gave me 1 lb. I returned to complain to the manager and he wouldn't even come talk to me. He sent the girl who took my order to tell me …"
18,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,a month ago,By far this is got to be the best seafood restaurant scratch boiling Crab scratch Asian and Cajun this is the spot combo E soooooo good it's like a feast for royalty easy feeds 4
19,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,6 months ago,"I regret that I ordered a basket with fries and fried catfish as there was not much fished to eat and it was very dry. Interior is cool but I came to satisfy hunger and I did not get a quality food, unfortunately. …"

21,Mr. Crab, 4 stars ,8 months ago,The seafood as in crab with the butter was excellent 😋 but other than that down part was this evening was too little much overpowering the taste but everything else was great

23,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,5 months ago,It was our first time there we got to sit down very quick and the food came very fast it was very worth the money we had the combo d with sausage and extra corn and potatoes and it was enough for me and my husband to share and the garlic butter seasoning was amazing will be going back forsure
24,Mr. Crab, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Great food,  good experience,  but real silverware would be great. The plastic utensils not a good idea"
25,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"We love this place!
I’m always hesitant to try new places and after reading some of the reviews I considered going elsewhere but am very happy we didn’t. …"
26,Mr. Crab, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly staff. Fresh oysters, lobsters, and crab. Shrimp seems too small and not as fresh. Overall, it's a good seafood place to go."
27,Mr. Crab, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Very good for the price and a fair amount of food comes with what you order. The fried shrimp and snow crab were money!
28,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Such a awesome time.  The food was on point,  perfection.

We ordered a 1 lb king crab leg boil and …"
29,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This place is awesome. They have amazing food with good portions at reasonable prices. Mr crab seasoning is the best. Staff is super friendly. I can't wait to try some clam chowder or a Po Boy next. If you like seafood places this place is a must try.

32,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,a year ago,"We thought this place would be just as good as similar places in the area. It is not. The boiled Shrimp were terrible, and definitely not worth $18/ lb. It tasted double frozen,  double boiled and thrown into a bag of overly greasy sauce. …"

34,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Love this place!!  We were greeted and seated promptly. Our waiter was on point with his service. We ordered three orders of combo A with a mix of all flavors. Food and source was amazing and delicious. Relaxed atmosphere with great service and food.
35,Mr. Crab, 2 stars ,7 months ago,I only rate them a 2 because we recently ate there and the service was really slow and I understand that but paying with my card I signed and left and realized they filled in the tip on my card statement. After I had left a tip already at the table that we sat at. Didn't appreciate that at all.
36,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,7 months ago,They get my order right every time .I got the combo b with the signature seasoning spicy!!  Amazing quick service and food is always hot and so delicious .

38,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,a year ago,Food was delicious sauces were good not to heavy so that you could still taste the crab portions were great considering the not too high price the service was great despite it being completely packed servers were helpful and friendly …
39,Mr. Crab, 3 stars ,5 months ago,It was OK. The service was good. The food was average. Not a place I would go out of way to eat at.
40,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great food and service. Market value on some sea food means it can be pricey.
41,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,7 months ago,Paid $60 for 2 pieces of King Crab leg that was probably 1/2 pound. They’re inconsistent with their portions and my order is usually 2 legs and a leg with a claw a 2 corns with 2 potatoes. Today I paid extra for corn cause last time I was …
42,Mr. Crab, 4 stars ,9 months ago,The food was good $$ the tip is included automatically😞
43,Mr. Crab, 2 stars ,11 months ago,"The crab was watered down and didn't have much flavor at all. The oysters were pretty good. They took about 15 minutes serve us and weren't busy at all, yet I had to go up to the front and ask why I hadn't been seen yet. Overall I would never go again."
44,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The food is amazing and the service is excellent!
All seafood is fresh and the Mr. Crab Signature seasoning is literally the BEST!!!! YOU MUST GO!"
45,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,11 months ago,I was very disappointed first day trying mr crab. Order $100 worth of food and my family didn’t eat any of it . I ordered the A bag shrimp wasn’t  cooked. Sauce was not good ordered oysters basket. Order the lemon pepper chicken wings. Also …
46,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"This place is putting Boiling Crab, Asian n Cajun, and any other places to shame. Service 5 stars, speed the food came out 5 stars. Will be back many more times for sure. The Manager Anne and the staff were on it! Anyone we made eye contact w was right there asking if we needed anything."
47,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,11 months ago,"Went in with my friend and had a bad experience the moment we walked in.. first, we asked if we could have a booth and the person who was going to seat us said they didn’t have any booths open so I said it was ok and proceeded to sit at a …"
48,Mr. Crab, 3 stars ,11 months ago,The service is better than the food! Mr. Crab signature sauce is soo tasteless and nasty with too much oil! When I got my crab bag I couldn't believe how good the food looked but when it was time to eat I was disappointed in the taste.  Joes Crab Shack and Asian Cajun is a lot better with taste and quality.
49,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,a year ago,I don't ever write reviews but this one I have to share. Worst restaurant experience we've had. It took 45 min for part of our food to arrive. When my son got his tenders I took a bite out of one and it was spoiled. The manager did end up …
50,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,6 months ago,"The food was good ,the server gave us free mimosas but put it on our bill anyway wouldn't take it off."
51,Mr. Crab, 3 stars ,a year ago,"My first trip, and I think we are going to stick with Asian Cajun and Boiling Crab. I really hate when restaurants advertise one thing, but don't tell you they don't have it until AFTER they bring your meal. I asked for the cajun waffle …"

58,Mr. Crab, 1 star ,a year ago,Didn't get our appetizers until 40 minutes after we finished our meal. Then it took them 20 more minutes to bring the check and a to go box. They still charged us full price even with the bad service.
59,Mr. Crab, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Good food and the place was very clean but! They should have some one at the front to handle seating because it took a while to be seated but other than tat all the above it was nice
