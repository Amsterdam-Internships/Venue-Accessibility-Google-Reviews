0,Mr Tom Snack Bar, 1 star ,2 months ago,"The store does not have the right name. It‚Äôs not Mr. Tom. They keep the name that is not correct. The food was awful. Overpriced and simply hard to eat. Hot dog, donuts, pizza‚Ä¶ everything was certainly not fresh. Don‚Äôt even know how this store can still be open."

4,Mr Tom Snack Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is small and very crowded; it is usually busy here. The prices are okay, and waiting for a dish does not take too long.

5,Mr Tom Snack Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Fries are fine, service is not. Got hit & spat on by staff. They gave us the wrong change. If you go, make sure you don‚Äôt get short change. If you get cheated on, call police and you‚Äôll get your money back."
6,Mr Tom Snack Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst place in Amsterdam. The food is so so but the people working there are so rude. They gave us wrong change. Got incredibly angry about it.
