21,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good food and service. Menu marked clearly with allergens in each dish. Very cute space inside. A bit pricy but the quality of the food matches the price. Overall a nice experience.
22,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Mr. Sam is just around the corner for me. On the outside it looks like a dark and small place, but once you enter the restaurant you really get absorbed into the atmosphere. It's a cosy wine and dine place, the sushi is amazing so make sure …"
23,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good, but the system didn't flow well, 3 dishes came out,  then we waiting almost an hour before the next 3. All dishes were shared, but some were preferred only by some people,  so one of our party waited almost 2 hours to eat!  So a little disjointed, however quite tasty."
24,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Lost and alone, I was lucky enough to have my phone battery die as I walked up to the entrance of Mr Sam. I stopped in, an hour before they were scheduled to open and was met at the bar by Mr Sam himself. …"

29,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food in a very nice bistro. Recommended you try the Carpaccio! Was on the expensive side, expect at least 45€ per person for enough dishes and some wine. Service kind of slow but with the location being so cozy it doesn't matter."
30,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service and unique servings of asian food.

31,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Nice service and good food. Loved it
32,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food but the portion is really small. If they could increase the portion, then I would say it could be worth visiting. Slightly overprice in my opinion."

34,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I had the dimsum, beef skewers and the pork belly. Also had some sweet potato fries on the side (they are called sweet potato chips). With more sides two dishes could have been enough. Everything tasted great, at a total of 40 Euro's per person (without drinks) it's not cheap though."

36,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice ambient. Ok food. Nice service. Not sure it's my favorite but it's really nice to have a drink there if you live very close. Food seems to be liked by others , not for me. So let me not bias you"

47,Mr. Sam Asian Bistro, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Good Food , nicely prepared and good service but quite expensive Three bottles of water 20 euros....  4 people no starters, no alcohol and 3 deserts: 160 euros...."
