0,EYE Bar Restaurant, 3 stars ,a month ago,"I remember 2 3 years ago when I went to Eye Restaurant, I loved the food so much. Back then the menu was tasty, very well prepared, with an elegant look and design. …"
1,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice view and nice food. But it was a bit strange that they had slowly cooked watermelon. Didn’t taste like watermelon at all!
2,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was great. I had the ribeye rare and it was rare. Very nicely done. The waiting staff were also very attent and did their job well. The view was amazing.
3,EYE Bar Restaurant, 1 star ,5 months ago,I am almost always disappointed when I go to the Ij for a film or exhibit and can’t have anything to eat or drink without having to deal with some bored university student who couldn’t be less interested in being at work and has zero …
4,EYE Bar Restaurant, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The best thing about it is defo the view, that’s a 5 star. The food is nothing special but alright, just a bit pricy."
5,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Excellent location overlooking the River Ij (not quite pronounced ""eye""). The table at the corner of the terrace has views in both directions along the river. Food is great too. They serve my favourite ""break bread"" by Menno so they can do …"
6,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great view, delicious dutch food, a nice cider, polite and friendly staff, oh did I mention the great view. :)"
7,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We visited Amsterdam last year and had our coffees here. Besides the fantastic views towards the city, we enjoyed cappuccinos and hot chocolate for the boys. The Madeleine cakes were the best we’ve ever tasted so we bought some extra to …"
8,EYE Bar Restaurant, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Had lunch / snack here. Beautiful place, great views, good dishes. Staff was a good representation of what you could expect in Amsterdam. Sometimes (one of the waitresses) you get a warm, welcoming, friendly and professional experience, …"
9,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had a quick coffee here, service is fast and the restaurant has a nice view out on the IJ. The interior is very cool, it’s a very spacious and modern building, but still with a relatively warm atmosphere. …"
10,EYE Bar Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food looked good but meat was really chewy. Ravioli as starter was better but nor great. Prepare to wait for service.
11,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great view from the restaurant and delicious homemade bread <3
12,EYE Bar Restaurant, 1 star ,a year ago,"The food was tasteless. The stareter was botetus mushrooms, which consisted of ONE, mushroom splashed on meshed potatoes. . Then we ordered Duck which was literally swimming in fat, cold and presented with three pieces of huge fatty toast. …"
13,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First of all, the place is beautiful, wide and cosy with a view of the city. A lot of portuguese choices, which was a nice surprise. I had a glass of portuguese Alvarinho wine and tried the mushroom risotto. It was delicious. Then we …"
14,EYE Bar Restaurant, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We actually love this place and the museum but the food is awful. This is bread with hummus and zucchini. I was thinking at least a few more pieces of zucchini but only two tiny small pieces. Check out the photo: this dish is 7,95 euros. Unbelievable!!!"
15,EYE Bar Restaurant, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The ambiance and view is both nice, also the fact that it is the EYE museum contributes to the stars. However the food is often bland or imbalanced. Very overpriced, a three course dinner for two can easily run up to over €100, overall a …"
16,EYE Bar Restaurant, 1 star ,a year ago,"The restaurant of Eye is at an exceptionally nice location. Unfortunately the staff is extremely rude and should not work in hospitality. I thought of giving a negative tip, but left this idea , as I was rather keen to leave!"
17,EYE Bar Restaurant, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Service very slow: ok that we didn't have to rush for a movie but waiting 1 hour for a course is not nice. Taste very poor, wrongly matched ingredients and not mixed. Picanha pretty bad...was very hard! Also lamb was pretty raw."
18,EYE Bar Restaurant, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Located across the water from Centraal Station, this restaurant offers amazing views of the Ij. The menu offers various options, but do not expect a lot of options. Quality is average, and ratio quality price fair. The best feature are the views and the service, friendly and efficient."
19,EYE Bar Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Wide open spaces and yet secluded. Salad was excellent. Kroket was toppie. And of course the view. Informal seating on the stairs when you have your own lunch box with you.
20,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place for food with family or with spouse. Food is delicious with a adequate price.
21,EYE Bar Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great quality fine foods for a good price. Nice casual atmosphere. The apple cake is the best I’ve ever had!!
22,EYE Bar Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The lunch here is actually quite good - and the view while you do it is amazing. If you want, you can watch a movie in the film museum afterwards - I don't know if that's any good though.."
23,EYE Bar Restaurant, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"decent, sounds better than it tastes, salads absolute trash, entrees ok, mains ok, the atmosphere and acoustics are the highlights!"
24,EYE Bar Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent location but the service was haphazard and slow; paid EUR2.50 for a tiny ball of ice cream on a bare plate...and had to ask for a spoon.
25,EYE Bar Restaurant, 1 star ,3 years ago,"No customer service, They ignore you."
