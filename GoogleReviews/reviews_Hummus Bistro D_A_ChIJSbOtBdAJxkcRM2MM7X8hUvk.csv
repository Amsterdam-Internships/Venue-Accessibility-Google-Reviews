6,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,8 months ago,simply the best place to have lunch. my favorite is the falafel with hummus. falafels are so crispy and soft on the inside and the hummus is super creamy and just very tasty (best one i’ve ever had). the pita breads make the experience even better and they are exquisite to dip into the hummus. also reasonably priced.

55,Hummus Bistro D&A, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice food, but would not recommend if you need to be anywhere soon.

65,Hummus Bistro D&A, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Food was good but not mind-blowing. I would NOT recommend dining in. We waited over an hour for our food and some of the staff were super rude to us for no apparent reason (we didn’t complain to staff or say/do anything that should have warranted the treatment). The service was so yucky and unpleasant I would never dine in again

67,Hummus Bistro D&A, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"The portions are getting smaller and smaller. And the taste of the falafel is not predictable, it tastes good once in  a while but mostly bad. The quality of the food in general is going down, that’s unfortunate…"

73,Hummus Bistro D&A, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice atmosphere. The hummus is not ‘Amazing’, the portions are quite small regarding the price and we miss some flavour. Also it would be nice if they offered glutenfree bread/pita’s to have with the hummus instead of veggies. It’s …"

75,Hummus Bistro D&A, 1 star ,a year ago,"Horrible experience. Service level was invisible, rude and weird. The food was not refined taste-wise and in the end crazy expensive (88 euros) for a regular lunch for two persons. (Fun Fact; after calling the place to make a reservation, …"

138,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,4 months ago,amazing hummus restaurant
139,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Extremely tasty and unusual food.  Don't be put off by the unfortunate name of this restaurant.  Strange food mostly of middle eastern origin.  It was immediately popular and very trendy as soon as it opened.  The bread accompanying dinner is made fresh in the restaurant on demand.  Defintely worth a try as an unusual culinary surprise.
140,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Wonderful food, cozy and warm atmosphere. The hummus is perfect, and so was the chreyme  (Moroccan fish) and the roasted cauliflower. Perfect halva parfait. Service with a smile, great open kitchen. That's how we love our restaurants."
141,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Hey im the head chef there , really good and fresh food made in the kitchen every day , open kitchen , feel free to come inspect it yourself 😁"
142,Hummus Bistro D&A, 4 stars ,a year ago,The food is great but the waiter doesn't have good vibes. I went there twice and I had an impression he didn't enjoy his work or the fact that I wasn't quick with choosing what I want to eat.
143,Hummus Bistro D&A, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good intentions, weak execution with a disappointing humus. We've tried the hummus over a year ago and weren't happy, it didn't improve (missing salt, lemon and tahini). The shakshuka was so-so (we tried two variants, both didn't make the …"
144,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Totally deserves 5 stars !  Friendly & quick service and finger licking good clean /healthy food at reasonable prices! They have a little something for everyone, me who eats vegetarian and my hubby who is a carnivore. Go with the ""little …"
145,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The hip place to be! Always full house and for a good reason. Great food and veggie options and I like the hip handsome no attitude service. And besides the food & service the atmosphere is comfortably homy. Love it.
146,Hummus Bistro D&A, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Even in a crowded day, service was super nice and fast. Really enjoyed the vibe and service. The decoration is unique and fits with restaurant purpose. Had ate hummus before which were more tasteful, maybe it's not my main thing."
147,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stop your hummus search now. This is definitely the best hummus in Amsterdam and I don’t care what The Fork says. The restaurant itself is already welcoming, but the food is the real reason to stay. Every dish is fantastic so you can …"
148,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Delicious food, excellent service."
149,Hummus Bistro D&A, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice small place with excellent Israeli food. We had proper hummus, labane, shakshuka and roasted eggplant (the staff is Israeli). It seems like a cozy place but it was very crowded around 2 PM and almost empty one hour later. Service was very slow, but friendly."
150,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome love the hummus bistro.
It was top on our revisit list when my partner and I went back to Amsterdam this year. …"

152,Hummus Bistro D&A, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"My girlfriend and I have been twice, both times the same result: very good food (the tasting menu is an experience not to be missed!) and friendly staff but not very professional. They don't seem to have experienced hospo personell on the floor."

Its a nice and cozy little place with friendly staff and exceptional authentic …"
154,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Love the place and the atmosphere, and the food was excellent"
155,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Our favourite place in all of Amsterdam, good Lebanese food, great hummus, excellent cakes, coffee and more. The staff made us feel like we were in our own home, and we visited this venue twice in four days. At night they do bookings, and it can get very busy. A place for locals, hope the tourists don’t find out about it too soon!"
156,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Tried the hummus chicken and cabbage steak with pita chips - out of this world. Would definitely go back. Highly recommended if you love hummus as much as I do.
157,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very very delicious hummus with falafel! Also the salad is really good. The place looks nice and staff is friendly. I will come back, be prepared!"

160,Hummus Bistro D&A, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is really good, however the restaurant took 1 hour 10 minutes to process an order via thuisbezorgd (this is without the delivery time that took an additional 13 minutes). When I received my order, one of the item was missing. I called the restaurant and they told me to deal with thuisbezorgd for this."
161,Hummus Bistro D&A, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Hummus and salad always excellent. Culliflower could be cooked a little shorter, to allow for a more grilled less boiled taste. Will still go back and order it again though!"
162,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A very good hummus at good price. Not far from the city centre.

164,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This tiny restaurant serves delicious food at very reasonable prices.  It is off the beaten track being in the Jordan district.  On the plus side you get to see many house boats if walking from Amsterdam Central area.

167,Hummus Bistro D&A, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"So many vegan dishes (expected for a hummus spot). Roasted eggplant and fig &roasted sweet potato salad are the highlights. Nice to fill the table with dishes to try. However it's all a little bland -- Sir Hummus, mana mana and the street market hummus carts all have more flavor."

171,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love this spot in the Jordaan, even though the place was packed (and I was late for my reservation with a silly excuse) staff was super friendly and helpful to fix us a table. Lovely humus with kebab, amazing deserts."

181,Hummus Bistro D&A, 1 star ,3 years ago,Get ready to wait outside (raining) for 30min to get a table to realize there a waiting list actually that was not suggested by one of the waitresses.. 30min after we asked about our table and a different waitress told us about putting the name in the waiting list now. Really? Good luck!!
182,Hummus Bistro D&A, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, nice prices too! Service could be a bit better and more friendly, but I can understand you guys are busy everyday. Back soon!"
183,Hummus Bistro D&A, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Pita bread was too thick,hummus was too soft and watery,hummus also did not have enough sesame paste, falafel was not right (Too crusty on outside,did not taste right and inside was not cooked well). In the Middle East there are quite a few …"

192,Hummus Bistro D&A, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very disappointed. Food has no taste. They even charged for the extra bread served. Drinks quantity is very small.  If you need Arabic food find another place to avoid any disappointment. Would not recommend for anyone to go to this place.

197,Hummus Bistro D&A, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very disappointed....:(
The dishes, specially the aubergine,  were very diferent than the pictures from the website. Even though the hummus tastes good, the restaurant is quite over priced and the service super slow and bad. Not a good experience at all."
