1,Hunter's Grand Caf√©, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really cool place to have a smoke AND a beer! There's very few places in Amsterdam that do allow both. It's very big with lots of seating and TVs, the staff are friendly and helpful and its centrally located and easily accessible. Will definitely be going back and would reccomend to others"

3,Hunter's Grand Caf√©, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place to smoke a joint AND drink a beer at the same time. This venue especially since they organize jam & listening sessions (music) several times a week.
