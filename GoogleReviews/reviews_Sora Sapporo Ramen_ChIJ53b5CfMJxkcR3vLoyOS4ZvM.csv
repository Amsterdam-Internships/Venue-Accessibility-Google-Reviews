2,Sora Sapporo Ramen, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Authentic ramen in the town. There are a number of choices to choose from. We tried all three basic ramen. They are great. However, for me personally, I find that they are a bit salty. Service is great. A tiny place so reservation is recommended."

9,Sora Sapporo Ramen, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"I always order Tonkotsu ramen to try out different flavors of the pork broth.

14,Sora Sapporo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Their ramen is absolutely amazing and the best I've had in Europe! The meat was really tender and the egg nicely seasoned.
