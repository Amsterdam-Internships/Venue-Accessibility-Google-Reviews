2,Breda, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We got the 9-course ""de hele mikmak"" diner served with requested half the amount of paired (natural) wines. Excellent, rich flavours (mmm lekkere sausjes!), dishes served at a perfect temperature, good atmosphere in the restaurant, friendly ‚Ä¶"
3,Breda, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Stunning! We went with the 7 course and it was the perfect amount of food and interesting flavors. Great service as well. Highly recommend.
4,Breda, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Great experience here for lunch on Saturday. Classic cooking done well with excellent service from start to finish. After a mistake we were given five courses instead of the four that we ordered for no extra charge - a nice surprise. Will definitely visit again.
5,Breda, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Beautiful restaurant with incredible food. Great presentation and flavor. Only wish was that there were more courses.
6,Breda, 4 stars ,2 years ago,a lovely decor simple. service is good. some of the plate of the surprise menu are outstanding. A sauerkraut soup was terrific. serving chicken is also bold and good the steak tartar on the other hand is mainstream. might be a bit on the expensive side for what if offers but i have enjoyed my meal
7,Breda, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Amazing experience dining here! I was especially impressed by a dessert (chocolate with mushrooms and some leafy green ice-cream I cannot recall anymore). I will definitely come again!
8,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Breda - is my girlfriend‚Äôs favorite restaurant in Amsterdam and when she wanted to celebrate she of course made a reservation here for dinner. ‚Ä¶
9,Breda, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The meal was to a good standard but no none dish stayed as memorable. The wine paring was ok but again nothing to write home about. For this price category at least one dish should spark more than just curiosity. A good enough restaurant for a decent meal for a group.
10,Breda, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"We have been very disappointed by the quality of the dishes. Those were overpriced in comparison to their quality. The wine list is not of a great quality and we got a 88‚Ç¨ bottle of sparkling-like red wine of very low quality. In addition, ‚Ä¶"

12,Breda, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Love at first sight!
It wasn't easy to make a reservation, but it worked out for lunch. High level, sophisticated and incredibly nice team. I'm already looking forward to the next ‚Ä¶"
13,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We had the five course lunch menu and were very impressed. They didn't offer a wine pairing as such but did give us by the glass recommendations for every course. The food was tasty and beautifully presented. The best food we had in Amsterdam.
14,Breda, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My wife and I had a nice lunch here. They offer 3, 4, 5 course meal on their lunch menu. We ordered the 5 course one and it was just right for our appetit. The dishes were carefully prepared, and they were delicious and refreshing. The waitresses were amiable and attentive. Oh, one more thing, this place requires a reservation."
15,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A chefs surprise menu. Each dish they make is unique and inspired by the string of meals. The wine here is great too they have a huge natural wine selection that is where you want to stay with your meal. I would let them suggest pairing ‚Ä¶
16,Breda, 5 stars ,a month ago,Really Good and interesting courses and wines.
17,Breda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Another very pleasant visit. Unfortunately we could only book a 2 hour reservation and this impacted on the dinner in that the courses felt a little rushed. However the food was wonderful as always. Inventive and full of flavour. We left with full and satisfied stomachs, and big smiles."
18,Breda, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Had a fabulous lunch at Breda. Dishes are creative but simple, and perfectly executed. The highlight was the wild duck with ponzu and sweet potato pur√©e.The wine list was also very good, and the service professional. Will definitely visit again!"

Food ‚Ä¶"
22,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely amazing! They have a mind for excellent combinations which are super delicious and locally inspired as well as using locally sourced ingredients. Whichever option of menu you choose, you cannot go wrong!"
23,Breda, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Overrated ! Unfriendly, we felt like they were in a hurry and by the we finished that almost kicked us out. The food was okay but far from the quality expected for that kind of price."
24,Breda, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food, staff, and location. All the fish dishes where amazing. Desert could have been stronger. And we‚Äôd love to have had a bit more time. We‚Äôll come back again."
25,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love all the dishes and small portion here. Fresh ingredients. Everything is tasty. Love the dessert
26,Breda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Outstanding!! The staff was more than accommodating it was my birthday no reservation the host sat us at 6pm with the intention of a 2 hour window for dining. We met that window could have stayed longer because the food and service was exceptional! Will return again thank you Breda for a memorable evening üòÉüòÉüòÉ
27,Breda, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food and excellent staff. They know there way in hospitality. Also know what upsell is ... lovely menu with all the seasonal items in it. First asperegus, lamb, lovely morille dish. Definitly a for the list to visit again. Also the cheese platter with dutch (big part) cheeses is a real treat."
28,Breda, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent to miss dishes. They experiment with fewer ingredients but one of them always ends up being too overpowering. Nice presentation and service. Still, at the end you feel you paid a lot to have your mouth used for an unsuccessful experiment."
29,Breda, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice food experience in Amsterdam. New look at traditional ingredients. Probably a bit pricey though...
30,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent modern cuisine using local Dutch produce and some Asian touches. Wine pairing was also well done and service was very friendly.
31,Breda, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Great food, lovely terrace and service"
32,Breda, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I have to leave a review. I am giving two stars only for  the interior design.  My expectations were high, based on the google rating and recommendations from some friends. You are paying for a fine diner menu but its definitely not worth ‚Ä¶"
33,Breda, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome service. The food was a surprise in every bite. It was the chefs menu day. Loves some other not so much. But ended up good. Great atmosphere!!
34,Breda, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Solid tasting menu. We went for the 9 course one and the food was pretty delicious. Good experience, with friendly yet professional service. Recommended"
35,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food is just amazing!! They try something different then most other restaurants I‚Äòve been. We took the 7 course menu but if you go their take the 9 course menu it‚Äòs just amazing. You will regret it if you take the 5 or 7 course menus

37,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I went to Breda with boyfriend this year and it was a great experience. You can choose a table close to the front window and sit next to each other instead of across from each other. In the restaurant you can choose between Basic, Extra and ‚Ä¶"
38,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was booked by our Dutch friends as we had all loved Guts and Glory last year. I loved the room, minimalistic and very stylish. Excellent service and super food. Can only give this five stars as it was excellent. Good wine choices also ‚Ä¶"
39,Breda, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice looking place with friendly service but food was a miss. Wine was good, mussels were actually delicious but out of 7 courses menu nothing else really stood out. Yogurt with strawberries for dessert was a disappointment. No foodgasm happened. Didn‚Äôt worth the money but still enjoyed the atmosphere."
40,Breda, 2 stars ,7 months ago,I was really looking forward to going to Breda as I had heard a lot of good about it. Unfortunately I thought the food was not that great and not worth the price. The combinations of flavors did not go well together‚Ä¶
41,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food and wine.  Loved all the dishes

43,Breda, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was very good, especially the fish which tasted very fresh. Just slightly disappointed with the main course of free-range chicken which felt just decent (given the price). ‚Ä¶"
44,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Unique dining experience; a treat for the senses. Use of Dutch and French ingredients. Professional service.
45,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place with a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù menu and cosy atmosphere. Staff is extremely friendly. Would love to come again but for different menu
46,Breda, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A warming treat. 5/6/7 courses - take your pick. The pairings are lacking, but the wine list soon makes up for any slack"
47,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had lunch at Breda at Saturday. Total 6 courses; not a single miss. Modern cooking. We loved the lamb sous vide, nice cheese selection and the matching wines. Very friendly service, relaxed. Value for money!"
48,Breda, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderful memories of Breda. Quiet, relaxed, romantic. Superb, caring and attentive staff. Lovely, sophisticated small restaurant that serves fabulous food in a convivial setting."
49,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Prix-fixe menu with modern and daring courses. Service is personal and friendly, yet professional. Portions may seem small, but will prove adequate after a complete multi-course meal. Pricey, probably not a place to bring the kids (though mine enjoyed it immensely!)"
50,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I loved my dinner.   Choice of 5, 7, or 9 course fixed meal.  I ate here with 2 work colleagues and spent 3 hours here eating amazing food and enjoying some wine.   Waitstaff was amazing.   We had the 7 course and it was plenty to eat. ‚Ä¶"
51,Breda, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A charming restaurant that makes you feel like your friends are cooking for you. The menu is a tasting course and each dish is well executed and tasty. There was an amuse bouche of bloody Mary sorbet and oyster that was fun and delicious. ‚Ä¶
52,Breda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Simply outstanding. A highly recommended 7 course menu with a fantastic variety of excellent flavors, bitter / sour / sweet perfect mix. Good and relaxed and at the same time highly professional service. The atmosphere is stylish, good light concept and cool interior design. Highly recommended and will go again!"

57,Breda, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice ambient setting, however the menu (even though changing daily) isn‚Äôt well suited to those with food intolerances or restrictions. Best suited for diners who are game for any and all food types. ‚Ä¶"
58,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing meal! And great service. I can't recommend specific dishes as the menu is a surprise and for dinner you pick 5, 7 or 9 dishes. So what I can recommend is to go hungry and go for the 9 as the 2 additional dishes we got were ‚Ä¶"
59,Breda, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good restaurant,  nice atmosphere with knowledgeable and friendly staff. Food is great,  although a bit expensive. Only downside was that I felt a bit rushed by the speed of dishes. I had a table reservation at 18 and felt they had to ‚Ä¶"
60,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent restaurant, refreshing and creative in so many ways! Always good to be populated mostly with locals too. We had the 9 course tasting menu which took about 3hrs to get through so you need to pace yourself and just sit back and enjoy and delectable array of small dishes that arrive. Wine is amazing also."
61,Breda, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The good: dinner menu was amazing - well sized portions of beautifully crafted, very creative dishes. Execution; second to none. Friendly and attentive service. Beautiful room and decor. ‚Ä¶"
62,Breda, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I left with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended) . Overall the food was great and the service was good. However the third course I could not stomach. I didn‚Äôt like it at all and expressed this to two servers. They simply did not care. ‚Ä¶
63,Breda, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a great restaurant in a nice part of town by a canal. The stripped down decor sets a nice scene to focus on the food. Very friendly waiters and excellent service. We had the surprise lunch menu, and it was delicious! Very creative ‚Ä¶"
64,Breda, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Although it was a quite interesting experience to taste dishes inspired by the Dutch cousine,to be honest, only 2 out of 10 items (including the amusement here) surprised me (flavour and texture). Atmosphere was ‚Äúgezellig‚Äù and attendants ‚Ä¶"
65,Breda, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I wanted to love this place but I found it quite pretentious. The service was super friendly but 7 courses took 3 hours! The food was imaginative but sparse- we left hungry and ‚Ç¨250 (for 2) poorer. ‚Ä¶

67,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing restaurant. Behind its simple menu (choice of 5, 7 or 9 courses) lies some very clever and hugely original cooking. Loved the surprise as each course arrived and was explained by the friendly staff. Central canal-side location, simple decor and a warm welcome. Perfect for a special occasion."
68,Breda, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Expected a lot from this restaurant, but nothing really stood out as a great dish. Service was good but the wine pairing wasn‚Äôt ideal, and the gluten free dessert was unfortunately a dissapointment, sorbet and a meringue."
69,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"What can one say, this was our best meal in Amsterdam on our trip. Everything was extremely fresh and flavorful. The raw food dish with herring roe to start was incredible and the sweetbreads dish was one of the best things I've ever eaten. ‚Ä¶"
70,Breda, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Myself and my partner went here last Saturday, after my parents had spoke very fondly about it after a previous trip to Amsterdam. The concept and element of surprise with the menu is very good, and the value for money is excellent. We ‚Ä¶"

74,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We came to Breda on the advice of friends and decided to book in for a late lunch. The restaurant is by a canal so we decided to grab a table in front of the water. FYI today is 31 degrees in Amsterdam so rather hot! Despite this we decided ‚Ä¶
75,Breda, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice restaurant with surprise tasting.menus. The focus is on local seasonal produce so it is nothing new as a concept but they do it well. A modestly priced wine list with interesting wines add to the appeal.
76,Breda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had truly memorable dining experience here. The whole staff was attentive, and warm. The sommelier made every pairing interesting and unique. The meal is on the more expensive side, but worth it for the experience."
77,Breda, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The portions are relatively small, but good experience."
78,Breda, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious, place is beautiful (especially inside), we ordered middle menu, but the 5 times can be ennoygh, excellent wine by the way!"
79,Breda, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A beautiful space with very nice food.  They offer a seasonal menu so it changes regularly.  Often busy so make a reservation.  They also have a nice variety of non-alcoholic options and are willing to amend the menu based on individual requirements.
80,Breda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A great experience. The menu is full of dutch taste and details. Is a good place to try out the true dutch cuisine. You can pick the number of courses you want to have and choose to do the wine pairing.

The restaurant is nice and has friendly staff. However, it did not meet our expectations. We were expecting that they would be flexible and experienced enough ‚Ä¶"

84,Breda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent. We had their 5 course option which worked well for w meat and fish preference. Nice choice of wine by the glass. Service very attentive. Nice setting .?
85,Breda, 1 star ,3 years ago,Horrendous tourist trap. There was a misunderstanding between the waiter and I. He ended up raising his voice and yelled at me when he was the one who failed to listen to me carefully in the first place. I am not one who argues so I told ‚Ä¶
86,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic dinner and service.
87,Breda, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice dinner yet the waiters killed the experience. They were more concerned with themselves and their friends at the bar. Also their service Level does not meet the dinner/restaurant style...
88,Breda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, menu is updated regularly. One of the best spots for dinner (or lunch) in Amsterdam, if you like set surprise menus. Good wine pairing."
89,Breda, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Breda served fixed chefs menus, so no a la carte. We found the flavors too repetitive, and after the third course I felt sick and tired of the same old base sauce. The hostess also walked around with her long hair down, which should be tied ‚Ä¶"

91,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food, so simple and yet elevated. I loved the bone marrow soup, the steamed cod and the beef tartar with barley! The desert was also amazing, not to heavy or overbearing!"
92,Breda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of those places where you leave with a smile and still be thinking of months later. Fine balance between innovative dishes and food you‚Äôd like to be in a menu. A cherry on top is the staff <3
93,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food, service and atmosphere"
94,Breda, 2 stars ,5 years ago,In our seven course horseradish was predominant as well as food that may have been better in any average street vendor in amsterdam. The bread and service were the highlights. Guts and Glory is by far a better experience
95,Breda, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Stumbled across this fantastic little cafe on a rainy day in Amsterdam. The decor is stylish, the bar staff and manager are gracious and attentive hosts and the food is delicious. A really great place to taste the local 'bitterballen'."

98,Breda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the top 5 meals I have had in my life. The food was great but the wine pairings were absolute perfection.
99,Breda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,You will not be disappointed. Menu is fixed and changes seasonally: it is always a nice surprise. Portions look small bit at the end of the meal you will feel full.
