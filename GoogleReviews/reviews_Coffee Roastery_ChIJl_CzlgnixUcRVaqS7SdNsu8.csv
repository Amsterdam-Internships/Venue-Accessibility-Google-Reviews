0,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great place.

I locked myself outside of the apartment on Christmas day. My girlfriend was …"
1,Coffee Roastery, 4 stars ,a year ago,"CoffeeRoastery is a nice place to have a coffee and croissant in the morning, specifically the cheese croissant. It was a surprise for me. Very flavorful and fresh. Lot’s of families and couples coming. The service is very nice too."
2,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere. Loved the coffee. They have healthy options, which I really liked. Acai bowl was amazing. Also we really liked the spicy chicken sandwich."
3,Coffee Roastery, 1 star ,8 months ago,"I visited this coffee place couple of times and always liked their service and coffee! But yesterday was an awful experience, there was a rude lady who I think wasn’t a waitress but had a higher level, maybe a manager or something! She was very rude and harsh! Dont recommend it!"
4,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good sandwiches, fair price and great ambiance. It has some comfortable armchairs and tables for computer working. Service is good and they do not rush you to choose or to leave, such as in other places. I’ll certainly come back."
5,Coffee Roastery, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Their croissants are good, yet their service for the most part is awful. Whenever I come in, no one greets me, I get ignored for a long time, until they finally see me, and then as if I'm in a factory, they ask for my order. Very very …"
6,Coffee Roastery, 2 stars ,a month ago,"Regular chai latte, Warm atmosphere.  The wifi doesn't work, don't think about going to work there."
7,Coffee Roastery, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The best Apple pie that I have ever had. Great atmosphere.  However, they do not have coffee methods, that is the only drawback."
8,Coffee Roastery, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice coffee place with lots of bake-offs and freshly made sandwiches. Coffee is good too, nice and hot, which I like :). But you got to be lucky who your barista of the day is, though. The quality of your cup of coffee can differ every time you visit."
9,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just an Omelet? Just an Omelet. Friend, it’s so much more than ""just an Omelet.” I mean…that first bite—oh, what grace that first bite is. Warm ciabatta, heavenly like the breast of an angel, resting gently on the pesto and Genovese below, …"
10,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Acai bowls are so good ,avocado toast is very nice as well, not a fan of the tomato one"
11,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,a year ago,When a place has 4 stars after more than a 100 reviews it's probably true. I'm giving this place 5 stars because of my own experience. The staff were very friendly to me and my coffee and omelet seemed pretty good. …
12,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,a year ago,"All of march and april 2020 , before and during the Lockdown , we were so very fortunate to be able to get comfort from drinking great coffee and even greater croissant with cheese oozing at da Coffee Roastery …"
13,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffee ,very comfortable design and atmosphere. The croissants was very good!"
14,Coffee Roastery, 1 star ,a year ago,"Not sure what the hype is about this place. The staff is okay, the clientele grumpy and the quality of the coffee varies! I have given them 5-6 chances. The first coffee I had, was delicious (wish I had remembered the face of the barista!) The rest tasted like coloring with milk!"
15,Coffee Roastery, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice place. Food and drinks are ok. Staff is not very friendly. Great minus - if you sit outside, it is a disgusting smell from the public trash."
16,Coffee Roastery, 1 star ,a year ago,"Normally the food is fine. But today I ordered 2 sandwiches and juices, spent 25 eur. I specifically asked for brown bread, which they said they had. They ended up serving me some other bread that I don't eat and the size was as big as bird …"
17,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite coffee in  all of Amsterdam. The staff is always very friendly and the location is very nice, next to Vondelpark. The food is also spectacular, I had several of their sandwiches and I am always satisfied. The process are quite good for the quality and the area as well. Never disappoints."
18,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely coffee place to have a nice break,homemade jucies and cakes...super yummy"
19,Coffee Roastery, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Coffees are ok and the apple pie is good. Unfortunately the service is far from nice and the staff always seem very cranky, one guy has even quite an attitude. Which is a shame as we like to pick up coffee a lot during the week but this makes us going else where."
20,Coffee Roastery, 3 stars ,a year ago,Great coffee and plenty of seating area to chill out and just relax and read. Nice selection of sandwiches too and cakes. A local favourite. …
21,Coffee Roastery, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Corona rules drive people crazy. Super slow, dry croissant and the lady who served food was wearing gloves. But without changing the gloves was cleaning out the table and serving food. Too dirty. Good coffee. That's why 2 stars instead of one."
22,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good coffee, great food healthy and delicious, super friendly staff!! Normal prices!!"
23,Coffee Roastery, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Good coffee, great açai bowl and REALLY good apple tart."
24,Coffee Roastery, 1 star ,a year ago,"I was at the coffee rostery the other day and I ended up paying 5,5€ for the worst avocado toast ever. Just plane White Bread and a little (almost none) avocado and then the worst mable??? Not satifsfied with paying that many euros for a really bad food experience. Would not recommend for the toast."
25,Coffee Roastery, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Best cheese croissants in the city. And I've tried many. Staff is not always the friendliest. A simple hello and goodbye are rare. Usually there's plenty of seating available and there seems to be a kid friendly downstairs. 5 stars if I would get a simple  hello and goodbye ;-)
26,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there twice while spending a weekend in Amsterdam, great atmosphere, even better food! Best chocolate muffin I've ever had and the pesto mozzarella sandwich will leave you so satisfied!"
27,Coffee Roastery, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A genuinely likeable coffee house serving a pretty cool neighbourhood. Only four stars purely because the coffee isn't quite of a similar standard to Trakteren which is close by, but the friendly, helpful, charming staff are a delight. The pastries are pretty decent too."
28,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,4 years ago,As a local I can't remember having better sandwiches in this place. The hot chicken and goat cheese are fingerlicking good. Coffees are also amazing and you can get your fresh juices mixed with whatever fruit you like. Obviously we fell in love with it on our first visit..
29,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good coffee, quiet place for working&reading also they have nice terrace to enjoy with sunny weather. If you're sweet person than that's your place."
30,Coffee Roastery, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice neighborhood place with good coffee. A latte and macchiato came to 6.10 euros. Did not try baked goods. It is a pleasant place with a mix of quiet working types and people chatting. Good vibe.
31,Coffee Roastery, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Coffee is fine, food is decent, but the service is so unfriendly that I can’t justify going back. Have gone at least 10+ times, as it’s in our neighborhood, thinking it will be different but service remains unchanged. Do not recommend."
32,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic coffee! And i adored the vibe of the place. Mind you it can be crowded and not every seating place has enough room for people with long legs. But even so, the coffee makes up for it!"
33,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very good coffees, great apple pie"
34,Coffee Roastery, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I really like your coffee and it's high quality....

36,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice coconut macaroons and coffee variation.
37,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a nice place. The seating is already lovely with the large table in the middle. Here you can meet other locals or travellers. Best are the cakes!
38,Coffee Roastery, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff and tasty pastries. Interior is very worn. holes in every chair are not very attractive, no matter how tasty your muffin is."
39,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is an interesting place that you find by reviews and it's god damn good! I had 2 sandwiches but I probably will try all of them, cakes are good and fresh juices are really hood too."
40,Coffee Roastery, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"This place has some of the coolest names for their chai tea lattes, which are reasonably priced! If you're in the area of where this cafe is it worth a visit. The place is fairly packed, but the staff are friendly and polite."
41,Coffee Roastery, 1 star ,4 years ago,"If they didn't have such good croissants and a few signature sandwiches we'd never be back. The service is beyond rude. You'll get rolled eyes, impatience - which is strange because their indifferent attitude demands YOUR time and tests …"

We live in interesting times we are all part of it but this was simple a very weird and unfriendly experience"
47,Coffee Roastery, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I live close by and regretted in all handful occasions I went to this place. Rude staff, more interested engaging with each other than the customers. Food is good but takes ages to get it."
