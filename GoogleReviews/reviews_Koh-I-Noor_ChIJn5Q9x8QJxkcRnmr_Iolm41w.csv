0,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 months ago,I went to this restaurant after roaming in Europe for 3 days and missed Indian food. I was so happy to find this place and enjoyed authentic Indian food in an unknown city which brought back so many good memories. The staff was friendly and made food to accommodate our taste as well.
1,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"We did enjoy the meal, and the staffs are very kind(thank you for recommending the mango lassi, it was really good 🙃). But we were not happy to find out there was something wrong! We didn’t order extra rice, but when we checked the receipt afterwards the price of the rice(4.5 euros) was included :(("
2,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place! The owners are extremely nice, offered us some good advices for the food and tea before we go. We got lamb curry and the prawn one -  both very delicious."

8,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Absolutely fantastic place. The service was fantastic and the food really delicious. We forgot to specify how hot it should be and it was just perfect. The taste is really like in India which you rarely get in Europe except the  UK

11,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This place reminded us of an Indian restaurant of the 90’s with its authentic but old school interior.

You have to try the king prawn masala, so good we went back the next day for more!"
12,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We love Sir Lankan food after spending 3?weeks there. So we figured let’s try Indian food. The good reviews do not do this place justice. The food was great with perfect spices and flavor  coordinated the perfect touch of heat. We had the …

16,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great stop to eat in Amsterdam.  Close to the metro and easy to spot.  The food was delicious and the prices are about average or slightly above for a casual Indian dining place.  The interior was well decorated but the bathroom is tough to …

26,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The chicken tandoori was absolutely the best ever. The chana masala was delicious. For the first time I had fish tikka tandoori which was phenomenal.
27,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It's a bit expensive but I really think it's worth it. We took one of their menu's. The portion was really big and everything was super tasty and delicious. Furthermore you sit in the center of Amsterdam! …

29,Koh-I-Noor, 1 star ,3 years ago,My experience on 14th Oct 2018 2pm. The service was too bad. The waiter gave me wrong order and when I am trying to clarify him he walks away taking new order. Finally  I called to correct him he says he is busy. The rotis he served were over roasted uploaded the pic of the same.

43,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent! Always a great pleasure to go back there. One of the most authentic Indian restaurants I've seen in Amsterdam. I recommend the tandoori mix and, if you like spicy food, the lamb madras curry."
44,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome place for authentic Punjabi Indian food! We had best tasting chicken tikka and lamb curry ever.  Staff were very welcoming and service was great.

46,Koh-I-Noor, 1 star ,2 months ago,Never go there.. Rude staff and this is not the right place to eat..
47,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This going to be one of my favorite restaurants in Ams. Food was great, not too expensive, and I didn't have to wait. Interesting to indicate that the waiter was wearing the face mask and gloves, this is not a standard in Ams yet for other restaurants I've been to."
48,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolute best. Ordered a menu for two persons and got more than enough. Really enjoyed the food, will definitely remember this place for the future."
49,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really amazing food. Their menu does offer a few new things. We really enjoyed their chicken dhansak. The ambience is nice. However the staff was always in a bit of hurry, which added a weirdness at the end of an nice dinner."
50,Koh-I-Noor, 2 stars ,10 months ago,Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the food. The dishes (Tikka Massala and Butter Chicken) had no veggies or anything else beside the gummy like chicken pieces. It was just meat and sauce.
51,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,a year ago,We had the best experience here! The owner was so nice and served us outside because the restaurant was packed. The food was awesome and he treated us like kings. We always talk about how great this experience was.
52,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service! Great food! Very hospitable ppl.. Went everyday of our stay at Amsterdam & never felt out of place, so far as Indian Food was concerned.. I wish I cd post some pics...Only its always fully booked..Being a small joint..So, preferable to book seats early"
53,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delightful restaurant with patient and generous staff. Their ""spicy"" option for dishes was an intense but enjoyable flavor, surpassing the spice level of most American Indian restaurants that I've visited. …"
54,Koh-I-Noor, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very bad service. Although 3 tables are empty they just let your baby eat at the messy bar in the back. No understanding... just a big mouth you need to order over 10 euros per person. No service at all. If people would be waiting in a queue outside I'd understand but people aren't. Now I understand why.
55,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Again a very nice meal. I have been coming here for 30 years, the quality of the food is still sublime and the service is perfect. The restaurant is well made coronaproof"
56,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Let me start by saying that this restaurant is AMAZING. Our server was wonderful. We started with the onion baajees with several sauces. Delicious. For our entrees we had Lamb Rogan Josh and Butter Chicken. It came with really tasty rice. …

58,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"On a short break and wanted some indian snacks and masala tea. Found this place while walking for hours just around the corner from Ann Franklin house in Amsterdam. Food was great nice and spicy just how we like it, the Chef was from Punjab India and has been running the restaurant for a few years. I do recommend this place to eat."
59,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Kohinoor is located close to Jordaan district.  It is right across the street from Ann Frank House and the famed Hotel Pulitzer is just 20 steps away in the same block.  Kohinoor serves Indian food at most hours.  One of the issues I faced …
60,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Exceptionally good Indian food in town. Good service, also available for lunch. The portions are big enough, reasonable prices and most important of all the food travels you to India. It's adjusted to Western standards, but still offering authentic dishes."
61,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic service and good food. A bit unnecessary to force an expensive bottle of water on us instead of tap water when that’s top notch in Amsterdam. Feels like throwing the environment under the buss for a secret fee. Maybe it’s …
62,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Was there around three months before, I still remember the amazing hospitality I received. I have to say the food was authentic Indian meal (Punjabi). Loved the taste. Don't expect much at the places in terms of interiors or space and it is a little bit above average on cost side too. But for good food those things don't matter."
63,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really great service! Butter chicken was absolutely delicious, as was the korma. Nan’s were cooked perfectly. A little bit on the pricey side but that seems to be the trend in Amsterdam anyway."
64,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The best Indian food I have had in Amsterdam and I have tried quite a few places! The mains are really great, albeit a bit spicy which suits me just fine. However I did not like the appetizers much (have not like appetizers at any indian …"
65,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent place to have Indian food in Amsterdam. One small suggestions though. I felt a little uncomfortable eating on the paper placemat with India's map printed on it. Which basically is thrown away at the end of the meal. Information …
66,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good and tasty Indian food. Its kind a home food away from home. The owner is very nice gentleman and takes time to talk to the guests to find their experiences related to the food. …
67,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"For an authentic taste it does not let you down. Each dish is freshly made. The garlic naan is perfect. The chicken dishes are fresh and tender. The chutneys have an authentic kick. I ended having dinner at this place 3 days in a row, …"
68,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best Indian food I have ever had, and I have had a lot. UK should take note dont use too much ghee on nan breads these were perfect .. chicken madras was spicy but so nice would highly recommend to anyone you wont be disappointed."
69,Koh-I-Noor, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It was an OK curry. I asked for them to make it Indian hot but it was not spocy at all. The portions were pretty good, not too much or too little. It's open from noon so it's ideal for lunch. Staff are really nice and attentive. The decor is nice too."
70,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome food! We enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala and Boneless Chicken Tandoori. Their naan is fresh and one order is a generous portion. …
71,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food and reasonable price. We are vegans and were looking for decent indian food. Taste was good, considering you are in Amsterdam, and price was reasonable, veg curry is like 15 euro (they serve roti with main course curries) and roti …"
72,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Even though I lived in Tooting, London, where there over 50 Indian restaurants, I can honestly say this is the best Indian food I have ever tasted. Every mouth-watering dish my husband and I ordered exceeded I wildest expectations. If don't …"
73,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Based on the recommendations, we went there and we were not disappointed. We ordered chicken tikka masala and lamb biryani. They were delicious and the portions were very generous. The waitress was very friendly. Definitely I want to go next time to try more dishes!"
74,Koh-I-Noor, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food itself was great, great taste and nice restaurant.

Where it all went wrong for me, was messing around with the water. The menu said …"
75,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had the best experience here! Super fantastic food. Top service! And great staff which always makes sure you having a great time. will definitely come  back.
76,Koh-I-Noor, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I am sorry, I don't usually write bad reviews. However I had a beer bad experience here, and so did most of us, party of 6. Two were happy with their food, the rest of us could not eat or complete the dinner. …"
77,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,7 years ago,The only Indian restaurant I have been to that serves generous portions of delicious curries even when you order the fixed menu (known as thali). It even includes gourmet coffee in lieu of dessert. Another unique feature: they put your …
78,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, excellent host,  reasonable prices! You will not find a better place than this one in Amsterdam for Indian food. People who run the place are passionate about it and don't  just treat it like just a business. I would definitely go back again and would highly recommend it."
79,Koh-I-Noor, 3 stars ,4 years ago,We ordered food for takeout. When we ordered a special the person who took our order wanted to overcharge us. When  questioned and challenged about price difference a lame excuse was provided. Long story short they corrected their mistake …

82,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,2 years ago,If you are looking out for a home style North Indian food in Amsterdam then this is the place. They are open all days from 12 PM to 11:30 PM. They serve food quick and hot!!
83,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food with English speaking staff, good portions with extras on the house"
84,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,7 years ago,My new local Indian joint! I have been missing a good reasonably priced takeout curry since moving to the 'Dam from Australia (where the options are plentiful) Recommend it to anyone traveling through and any locals too. Large portions (for takeout anyway) and quality curries :)
85,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a fantastic evening at this restaurant!

87,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Opened in 1981, Koh-I-Noor was one of the first Indian restaurants to open in the Netherlands. Open for lunch and dinner and offering late night dining, the restaurant is a favourite with both tourists and locals. …"
88,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Loved the food here. The Thali is perfect for two. So much variety and very appetizing. Chicken soup was a great starter. The service was really good as well.
89,Koh-I-Noor, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I was shocked by the degree of rudeness I was treated with at this place--I was actually treated like I was a piece of garbage by the arrogant waitress who thought she was right about something she wasn't right about. Initially, the service …"

92,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Still the best Indian cuisine in Amsterdam. They recently remodeled the interior during the covid-19 shut down and it looks great with authentic artwork from India. Tables are supposed for the current Corona measures, so make sure you have …"

94,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Staff was friendly took care of special needs on a request. Food portions were generous. Paneer could have tasted better (curry was good but paneer lacked the taste). Naan was also very tasty.

101,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The owner, chefs, and waitresses at Koh-I-Noor are just as precious as the restaurant's name suggests. My girlfriends and I were visiting Amsterdam from NY and decided to go for two reasons, our love of Indian food, and the crowds we …"
102,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good Indian cuisine that doesn't adapt too much to local cuisine (which I consider a good thing).

105,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Indian food is one of my favourites and this cozy restaurant has never disappointed. This is real food, not overly refined but exactly right and honest.  As is the whole establishment. Whenever we're in A'dam we visit it and we've been here a lot!"
106,Koh-I-Noor, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I was there with my 2 friends. The staff was very rude and over selling food. Staff was making fun of the other customers in their native language.
Although food was not bad.
Overall dine in experience was disappointing."
107,Koh-I-Noor, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Service not so good, some waiters are less welcoming. Food is good but in takeaway they don't include the mini sides like papadam, sauces which is standard in other Indian restaurants."

111,Koh-I-Noor, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We order samosa, tarka dal, paneer masala, garlic chilly naan, and lamb chops.  EveeEveryt we ordered was excellent.  The service wasvery good as well bit slow but not bad!"

117,Koh-I-Noor, 1 star ,5 years ago,There is a tendency to discriminate when Indian's have food here.. the initial papad and chatni were not served but being served with a flourish to Westerners.. food too wasn't as great as it has been made out to be when compared to authentic Indian food. Felt discriminated ironically in an Indian restaurant.. :)

119,Koh-I-Noor, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice Indian, Not the best I've had in Amsterdam but certainly up there. Only thing I can knock is they brought the starters and main dish out at the same time, strange."
120,Koh-I-Noor, 1 star ,2 years ago,Not at all welcoming to Indians. The staff was rude and they kept saying we need to order for a certain amount then only the order will be taken. In the end we had to leave and go to another Indian restaurant inspite of waiting for an hour.
