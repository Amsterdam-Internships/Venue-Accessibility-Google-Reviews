0,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"My girl loved her food, but I really didn‚Äôt like mine. I ordered the pork sandwich. The taste was fine, but there were only two small pieces of pork on the sandwich. It was mostly just pork fat and two pieces of potato. I don‚Äôt mind some fat on my pork but this was excessive."
1,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, attention and location!
Sad we didn‚Äôt eat there more.
Reservations for dinner recommended.
Gracias!"
2,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very tastwful authentic food. Pisco sour is delicious, though I believe it is a different preparation comparing to other places I have tasted. Chinchar√≥n and tres leches as dessert is a good call."
3,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The trees leches is amazing. So delicious. I regretted for sharing it with my wife ! Ahaha very nice spot to chill
4,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Cosy little spot in the heart of the city. Nice seating on the outside as well. Had the fish sandwich and it was really nice, so if you are in that area, swing by"

7,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,So yummy!! I wanted to go back the next day! Nice home made delicious Peruvian food and pisco sour!
8,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was great, ambiance as well, location is easy to find too. What could be improved was to have more staff, as there was only one waiter and he did his best and was very friendly, but one person doesn‚Äôt seem enough when the place is full. Would definitely come here again as overall it was a very good experience."
9,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"The food was good, no complaining at all but some parts of the service were bad. I ordered a starter and a main meal. Starter came after 45 minutes. After it was finished the staff told me the it's not possible to prepare the main meal and ‚Ä¶"
10,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Peruvian cuisine is delicious. This place is a little pricey, but worth it. We had 3 plates and all of them were perfect. The drinks were very good as well. I would highly recommend this place"
11,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,a year ago,We grabbed a terrific soy cappuccino and hot chocolate. The girl that served us was very nice and helpful. It felt like being at home. Such a small lovely place in the very heart of amsterdam. I wanted hot chocolate as well but since i am vegan there was no option for me. I hope they will make it as an option for future customers.
12,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"A very lovely restaurant with excellent food. The quality is REALLY GOOD!!!! It's located in an old renovated building and they have good service. The coffee is also very, very nice üòÅ"
13,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,a month ago,delicious food but it would be 100% nice if the service staff spoke Spanish since it is a Latin food restaurant.  point to note
14,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,1 co-worker from Hengelo insisted we do this Peruvian restaurant Casa Peru and I can tell you that I'm glad we did. The food tasted soooo delicious that I I'm definitely taking my family for a bite of Peruvian delight very soon. ‚Ä¶
15,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is amazing. Really fresh and tasty. They offer some special drinks such as inƒça cola and lemonade made from purple corn. The ting I liked the most was tres leches cake.
16,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice place. Excellent peruvian cuisine ! You wait a little bit but it is worth it ! If you fancy of new flavours , this is the place for you :)"
17,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Amazing place.  Great food.  Nice staff.  In summertime nice terrace.  The owner is the most sweet lady from Peru.   Love the pisco sour üòç
18,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Ok√© place to have a drink. Nice central location and a nice spot to have a drink outside. Didn‚Äôt had lunch/diner so can‚Äôt say anything about about it. Prices were ok√©. Serves looked unorganised and stressed, while it was not busy at all."
19,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"You can have a taste of the real Peruvian food... and its drinks, of course"
20,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Small menu. Food is average (not bad). Wine was expensive for an average taste. Everything average in fact
21,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"chicken and fries were not good, maybe other dishes are better. It's a nice place to hang by the canal and have a pisco"
22,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty good but the quality varies from time to time. The food is limited in terms of choice although the pricing is firmly stratospheric. Service is all right generally but not particularly great. OK as a stop-gap measure but if you really want good Peruvian, try PeruvianKitchen.nl on the Bilderdijkstraat instead."
23,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really tasty food
24,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Food is just not good. Arroz con mariscos is awful.  Very bad food, although the restaurant is ok"
25,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The location is amazing, staff super friendly! Food is also really good, I had the Chupe de Camarones (shrimp soup) and it was super tasty! Just one thing: it comes with a big shrimp inside, that you have to peel. They don‚Äôt give you a ‚Ä¶"
26,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Service was not good and slow. The food has NOTHING to do with Peruvian food, just a place to eat something and continue, but don‚Äôt expect to get it fast!"
27,Casa Peru, 1 star ,7 months ago,Never been treated this bad. Took them more than one hour to get me a drink. Also the order got lost. So 1 hour and 30 minutes later no food. No excuses at all.
28,Casa Peru, 1 star ,6 months ago,"No hospitality. Booked table and no table available when we get there, at arrival we were told to find my on table outside if we can. Waited half hour for a table to leave. ‚Ä¶"
29,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Could have been so nice, the plates looked very nice. Unfortunately the waiter wasn't polite nor professional, and our desert was burned. Even after showing it to the waiter the second time he didn't react and just threw it away. When we ‚Ä¶"
30,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We had dinner at this place, I‚Äôm from Mexico and can tell you that the flavors are as you have them in Latin american kitchen. Price is ok for what you receive, portions are good. I can recommend"
31,Casa Peru, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Terrible service. Waited 40 minutes for just a drink, food never came after 1.5 hours. Terrible hospitaly. I'm peruvian, it ruined my friend's first peru food experience. Never coming back"
32,Casa Peru, 1 star ,9 months ago,"I go to many restaurants in Amsterdam and I decided to give this one a try since it is next to my office. When we arrived there, we were told that more than half of the menu was not available, because they were very busy in the weekend and ‚Ä¶"
33,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,a week ago,Attention was not very good and the food is too expensive.
34,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Excellent food that tastes like home made. Simple and delicious üòã
35,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"It's the real deal, meaning it has the authentic Peruvian flavor. Great addition to the restaurant scene in Amsterdam. Highly recommended."
36,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,4 months ago,It was OK Peruvian food. The best plate was the ceviche.
37,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a wonderful place and really good food. Definitely a place to come back!
38,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing Peruvian food and excellent service. As Americans we were unsure of how the ordering process would be different and the staff was very kind and patient.
39,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Food is good, but waaaaaaaaay overpriced. The service is VERYYY slow! so, if you are looking for good food and you don't mind paying more than other places around Joordan AND you don't mind to wait, then, yes, try this place."
40,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,10 months ago,I was there 2 days ago‚Ä¶ such a delicious food they have! I mmmm-ed every bite for the first couple of minutes. Yummy! I had the jalea. Super lekker! Looking forward for my next stop at their restaurant.
41,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place to sit, especially on the little ""roof lounge"". Coffee is alright and I had a really nice steak sandwich! üòä"
42,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,7 months ago,The food is amazing. The price is steep. The little tables on the bridge are nice to be at.
43,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Just like I ate at Peru, very delicious."
44,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Beautiful, quiet location along a canal. Food was not high quality Peruvian - somewhat bland and overpriced. Dine here for the location not the food."
45,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hidden gem in the Amsterdam city centre! Very exquisite and tasty food for a reasonable price.
46,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We went there on a lazy Monday early afternoon. It is a small size Caf√® and Restaurant, with comfortable chairs and tables indoor (outdoor was still closed for winter). Two girls were on duty by then, they have been extremely kind and ‚Ä¶"
47,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,8 months ago,I think its renamed to BLACK STOCK COFFEE
48,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Delicious pisco sour, good pumpkin soup and pleasant service. Reduced options for vegetarians during the pandemic."
49,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A great little restaurant. You are assured of friendly hospitality and good food here. We did not try the ceviche but the fish was very acceptable, as was the pisco sour! ‚Ä¶"
50,Casa Peru, 1 star ,3 months ago,Falta sabor. Flavor would be missing.
51,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I wanted to order some food but were arrived a bit late in the evening. We did enjoy a glass of wine but the none of the staff were attentive enough to get to us in time to take our food order.  So we had one more glass and left.  The food we saw looked good from afar
52,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely little restaurant with both Dutch European dishes as nice food from Peru.
53,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We've just had a fantastic meal here - cerviche excellent & great pisco sour - takes us back to Peru! The owner was lovely - food amazing couldn't fault it. Definitely the best food we've had in Amsterdam!
54,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Food was good. Close to the real stuff. Aj√≠ de gallina was really tasty.
A bit pricey though and not really justified."
55,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Cool place with great coffee, food and desserts üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº"
56,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,a year ago,"the food was okay but definitely not worth the wait, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you are a big group or a family, especially since there are no options for kids. not a very fast service and pleasant experience"
57,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I used to pass by this place and it looked nice so I thought I would try it one day. I'm a bit disappointed tbh. Very expensive  (a piece of cake is ‚Ç¨7.50) the food is nothing special for its price. The selection is okay but not sure why ‚Ä¶
58,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ahhhhhmazzzzinggggg!!!! The food is so fresh and delicious!! Nice atmosphere. So so delicious!!!
59,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,As a Peruvian native I can vouche for this place. It's nicely located and the ambient is right. You won't fine the more traditional Peruvian dishes but rather a more accessible version of them with local ingredients but they still manage to keep the essential flavor of the dish. The bar is also good.
60,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little coffee shop with fairly cheap coffee and seats right by the waterway, so you can watch all the boats! Doesn't do ""proper"" iced coffee though, just a cappuccino with an ice cube or two, but the coffee was smooth and the waitress was friendly."
61,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,5 months ago,They took like an hour to get my order ready and it is pricy
62,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"This restaurant is a bit expensive, even by Amsterdam standards. And the price is not reflected in the portion sizes. Unfortunately for us we ordered a starter of ceviche, which costs even more than some of the mains on the menu, and the ‚Ä¶"
63,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,5 months ago,...as always tasty! love peruvian food!
64,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Service is a bit slow but tasty and good ambiance
65,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Fast service Good food Chill place
66,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Good food but the service was SUPER slow and the price was expensive for the quantity of food.
67,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"First time I tried Peruvian dishes, so I cannot compare with traditional recipes. Nevertheless, everything I tried was good and tasty. Service kind and efficient. I will surely try again other dishes here. Nice to eat outside in sunny days."
68,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Located near the canals this place is not very big on the inside which has its charms. You can sit outside if you prefer that. ‚Ä¶
69,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Really great peruvian food for a good price. Specially ceviche, lomo saltado and aj√≠ de gallina."
70,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Very quick and not refined. The place is engineered to be a quick catch for tourists knowing it is a one off. ‚Ä¶
71,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A friendly little Peruvian restaurant with delicious food that will warm your heart and soul. The food is excellent,flavourful and you can feel that it is made with love. It can be a good place for a date or a cozy dinner with friends."
72,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We ordered pumpkin soup and ceviche. The ceviche was good but the soup was cold! That's a pretty basic mistake that I don't expect a decent restaurant to make.
Besides they were a bit understaffed, so the service was slow."
73,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,a year ago,"We will give it another chance in 6 months time, hoping that it was the lack of ingredients with the lockdown that deviated the dishes from the quality and taste, and closeness to Peruvian food it once had."
74,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Love the rustic atmosphere. We‚Äôll definitely be back
75,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I couldn't have had a better introduction to Peruvian food! The Picante de Mariscos was delicious, as was the Lomo Saltado. Add a glass of sangria, and you have a wonderful meal.  Despite being quite busy, our waiter attentive and on top of things.  I would definitely go back."
76,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Possibly the best restaurant I've been in the world. Recommend anyone visiting Amsterdam to try it!
We had seafood rice, shrimps, some starter, can't recall which, and homemade sangria. We were all completely delighted!"
77,Casa Peru, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Nice place, good food but not great, pricey. I guve a bad review because of the service it was awful, rude waitress and waiter,  they give us the ‚Äúoption‚Äù to choose between 3 dishes because those come out of the kitchen faster if you choose ‚Ä¶"
78,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is amazing, a truly new experience! The ambience is also great, we had dinner at the canal, and the service is very good too. A bit on the expensive side, but it is justified by the quality of ingredients."
79,Casa Peru, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We had lomo saltado and ceviche.
My wife is from Peru, so i know peruvian food.
The Lomo was ok, but nothing special. I could have prepared it better at home. ‚Ä¶"
80,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved the food. I live here and I wanted to try something different instead of the tipical local specialities. Well, in this restaurant I got it. Unique taste ( from South-America), with friendly waiters around."
81,Casa Peru, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great location with canal view. Annoying waiter telling me a normal beer (to local standards) is a babybeer. Nice try to upsell larger products but gives impression of tourist trap
82,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had a very pleasant first experience of Peruvian cuisine last night ( I wanted to have a try before travelling to Peru in a few months - it's a good mise en bouche . Very tasty indeed. The waiter who attended was very helpful.
83,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent and authentic food, great cocktails and friendly staff. A bit above average priced, but definitely worth a visit."
84,Casa Peru, 1 star ,4 years ago,"SO DISAPPOINTING portions, and extremely pricy. it is not even a gastronomic restaurant. According to the carless waiter, they were using bigger plate which probably was making the portion look smaller ... hahaha such a bad excuse!!!
2 others tables beside us were also complaining and getting really angry."
85,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place. The food is amazing, the place is cozy and during the summer, a beautiful terrasse is set up in front of the restaurant, next to the Canal! Highly recommended :)"
86,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful location. I had the ceviche, which was really delicious and I'm glad I tried it, but i was a bit disappointed it wasn't a full meal for the price. Add some bread and it would have been a meal."
87,Casa Peru, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Poor service and subpar food. We had the ceviche and the lomo saltado. the ceviche was OK but the lomo saltado was quite terrible. There was a hair on my food and our waitress was barely apologetic, did not remove it or offer to replace my food."
88,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food is delicious. The presentation is awesome. However the price of the ceviche was too high in comparison with the amount you see on the plate.
89,Casa Peru, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Portions are small compared to the high prices. Taste was okay, but nothing like the original Peruvian recipe. No original Peruvian beer, only original Peruvian drink was Pisco, for an enormous price. Service and appearance could use improvement."
90,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Unexpectedly Great food, knows a pisco sour,"
91,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great food, great service! Authentic flavours üíï."
92,Casa Peru, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I was hoping for a good Peruvian dish, but it was nothing special and very expensive for what we had. Moreover, I've booked for a table close to the window and I couldn't have it since the possible table was for 4 people."
93,Casa Peru, 1 star ,4 years ago,"DO NOT RECOMMEND. VERY SMALL PORTIONS FOR THE PRICE. OVER PRICED, BAD SERVICE (insolent and unapologetic Italian waiter) AND WE FELT FRUSTRATED AND UNDER FED.
For Peruvian food, you'd rather go to  SALMUERA on Rozengracht!!"
94,Casa Peru, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Different prices on the website compared to the menu card in the restaurant, of course prices in the restaurant more expensive... You pay 18.50 euros for a ceviche of 100 grams fish and the taste is nothing special...complete disappointment"
95,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice spot to have some Peruvian food. I enjoyed a Lomo Saltado and it was tasty. I would recommend if you‚Äôre missing some authentic Peruvian cuisine!
96,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A must: Lomo Saltado. Absolute the best peru dish ever!
97,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Can't really say much about this place in covid times, but their take away Pisco Sours are excellent"
98,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"My wife being from Peru, we have eaten much Peruvian food and this is my wife's favorite restaurant in Europe for Peruvian food.  The ceviche and chupe de camarones are very good.  The service was great and the location was very good.  The ‚Ä¶"
99,Casa Peru, 1 star ,4 years ago,Very high priced food. Ordered a Lemon Pie >> got a Cookie with little lemon cream an lots of meringu√©. Club Sandwich also way to expensive. All in all disappointing. One Star for the cosy interior.
100,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Stopped here for a quick drink during a bike tour around Amsterdam. Sampled some Bitterballen which were excellent and a perfect accompaniment for our beer.
101,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing food and worth every penny. It doesn't receive the full five stars because the staff wasn't appropriately dressed even though the staff was really nice it had to be said.
102,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First time eating Peruvian food, it was all very good from the food to the drinks! Service was great, we were attended by a very friendly Italian guy who spoke Italian, Spanish and English"

104,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great location. Absolutely wonderful true Peruvian cuisine. Really tasty huanca√≠na. Ceviche with cancha was amazing and the pisco sour exceeded expectations.
100% recommendable."
105,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious Peruvian dishes. Highly recommend all the ceviches and the lomo saltado. And of course, what's a good Peruvian dinner if it's not accompanied by a few Pisco sours."

111,Casa Peru, 1 star ,3 years ago,The place is really bad! We have ordered 2 sandwiches. It took them 40 mins to bring the food. The waiter was rude by saying ‚Äúwe are not McDonald‚Äôs...‚Äù
112,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice food and Vibe! They take some time preparing the food but is totally worth it and fresh!
113,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Comfy seats and refreshing lemon pie!
114,Casa Peru, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Really good traditional Per√∫ dinners. I suggest for a drink to order the pisco maracuya sour! Try to be there early for dinner the kitchen is closed really early.

125,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good spot for lunch, food with a distinctly Spanish influnce. Relaxed and friendly. Good value."

128,Casa Peru, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"From all the Peruvian restaurants we tried the Ceviche, causa and mariscos is the best here."
