1,Bar Mick, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I was served by a very charming young man named Wilbur whose knowledge of wine was exceptional. It was our first visit to Bar Mick but thanks to Wilbur, it definitely won't be our last! Thanks again Wilbur for making our evening!"
2,Bar Mick, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great service, lovely terrace to watch the  Spaarndammerburt from, lekker biertjes, what more can you want? Oh, the food menu looks good and varied too. We will pop back for dinnerüòãüëå"
3,Bar Mick, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This bar is the real deal. I didn't eat so I can't speak to the food quality. I can say that based on service alone they earned all 5 stars. The staff is amazing, attentive and super friendly. The owner made they took the time to ensure ‚Ä¶"
4,Bar Mick, 5 stars ,6 months ago,They have great vegan option. Cozy cafe
5,Bar Mick, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great burger. Try the burger. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the burger is served very rare, which I enjoy, but freaked out one of my friends. If they had given us a headsup, that would have helped, but otherwise the service was great."
6,Bar Mick, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Several special beers on tap and a bar tender who knows about beer. For a bar they also have a wide range of wines to pick from. Good atmosphere and there is a real kitchen so you can also get some very decent food.
7,Bar Mick, 4 stars ,4 years ago,This is a small bar in an unknown area. They have some good and quite different beers available on the tap. This bar also has some good food which you can try for lunch and dinner. ‚Ä¶

10,Bar Mick, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cosy restaurant with good food and friendly staff. It was completely full so I would definitely suggest having a reservation. The only (tiny) downside is that the tables are pretty close together (as it's a pretty tiny place).  But all in all a great experience
11,Bar Mick, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"There's nice fresh food, the lunch portions were a bit small but an apple that I ate afterwards solved that. The waiters were very kind and all the food I had tasted very nice."
