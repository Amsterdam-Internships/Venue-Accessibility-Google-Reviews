1,Stadspaleis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely staff and good, homemade sandwiches and burgers. Splendid place to have a quick bite in the terrace, in a sunny day."
2,Stadspaleis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My personal favourite cafe in Amsterdam centre. The place is tiny inside with outdoors seating, but super cosy with interesting decor to look at. The staff there are absolute legends. Every time i‚Äôve been there they were nice and always ‚Ä¶"
3,Stadspaleis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is great. It's so cute, welcoming and homely.

4,Stadspaleis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really incredible experience. We're a family of 6 with 4 guys above 6'2"" they managed to squeeze us in in a real cosy and comfy way. The food is simple but great, a real feel at home place. 5/5 would recommend."
5,Stadspaleis, 5 stars ,a year ago,My favorite coffeespot in town!
6,Stadspaleis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome little gingerbread house among all the tall buildings. The last of the old police stations in Amsterdam, now an historic monument! Great food, the veggie burger was awesome, and they made it in a lettuce wrap for me. The veggie wrap was excellent as well. So quaint and unique!"

9,Stadspaleis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place, super cozy and delicious food. The staff was amazingly friendly and the prices are also very good especially if you consider it's in the middle of Amsterdam, I would definitely come back here again. My friends and I all had a different burger and we were all happy with our choice. Thanks guys"
10,Stadspaleis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stopped in for hot drinks to warm up, and had amazing chai lattes and golden turmeric lattes, all made with non-dairy milk. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was charming and relaxed. Great place to stop in!"
11,Stadspaleis, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A fun, quaint place staffed by upbeat hip kids. The downside that the ""fresh organic"" food was none of the sort, the overpriced vege burger was the kind of thing one may expect from an all night kebab shop - just at double the price. The flat white seemed the lack any trace of actual coffee. However, a fun place to hang out."
