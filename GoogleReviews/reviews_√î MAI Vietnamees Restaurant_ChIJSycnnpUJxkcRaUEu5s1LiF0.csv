5,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food came quite quickly, which is great when you're in a hurry or hungry. Both noodle soups (Pho dac biet and Hu tieu nam vang) we had tasted great. As a Vietnamese I can't say those have been the best ones I had. But they've been …"
6,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Typical food from the south of Vietnam. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food. I took Rice with shrimp (Cơm tôm nướng) and Dry noodle (Hủ tiếu nam vang khô). But the shrimps were too dry, maybe they already cooked and left in the air for long time and the noodle sauce is salty."
7,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had delicious Pho and Summer Rolls. We did not have to wait long for the food and it tasted very good. The furnishing is very simple, but we felt very comfortable. 🙂"

9,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I often go here for springrolls just before my gym :) they're very cheap and so yummy, I find the sauces they make are really good and authentic.

10,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love Pho here. I found this place accidently...just searched the closest Vietnamese restaurant to The Skinny Bridge. Besides Pho at Flinnders Street in Melbourne,  this is my 2nd rank of my favorite Pho I ate til now.  I just expect they give bigger portion of bowl and beef with this price.   (about €12-13) l"
11,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"I like the soup very much, its quite big portion, probably mostly noodle, not much meat but its tasty & reasonable price. It taste quite the same in Vietnam"
12,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pretty good chicken pho and pork meat ball baguette. The reason for not giving a five star rating from me was due to the restaurant declined to provide tap water. You can only buy bottle water there. What a shame!
13,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Honestly, no faults with this place!
My friend & I, neither of us either Dutch or Vietnamese, were wondering the streets looking for good food at a good price. …"
14,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Pho was pretty okay, not the best. The hu tieu and hu tieu kho however was unexpectedly good! Super tasty but light broth :)

24,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,Favourite pho in Amsterdam. Really flavorful broth and high quality meat. It’s a bit pricier than what I’m used to for pho but I’m okay with it given the higher quality ingredients and generally food in this city is just expensive.
25,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Amsterdam. My Vietnamese friend brought me here which says it all. Great food, super fresh, tasteful, lovely vibe, great staff, always happy to be back. For those interested in what you will spend for 2 …"

28,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Really wanted some pho and thought to try a new place. The main thing about pho for me is the broth, which was ok, but really little for the price of 16 eur. Like it barely covered the ingredients, which is really disappointing. Also, i …"

32,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is my ‘canteen’ for comfort food. I come here nearly every week to taste their specials. The staff are passionate of the cuisine and we can always eat well here. They serve the best pho and pancake (ban xeo ) in Amsterdam. Their vegan …

34,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, fast and friendly service, and a fun ""spicy challenge"" that is super easy for anyone who likes even mildly spicy food. Have a tasty and free meal, with at least a slight tingle. 🙂  My family also really enjoyed their meals."

38,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very tasty dinner. Have been there twice already. Friendly staff and quick service. My favourite dish is Pho Bo but there's plenty of other options to choose from. I'll happily return in a few weeks ;)
39,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place has legit pho. It's tough to find good asian restaurant in Amsterdam. But I was surprised when I found this place and how authentic their Banh mi and pho was. Highly recommend.
40,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When I am in Amsterdam , I make time to come and eat here. The place is small and clean. The food is excellent and staff is friendly and kind. (Sometimes hard to find in Amsterdam). I enjoy their. Summer rolls and Vietnamese sandwiches. Ask …"

45,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The pho was super delicious. However, I ordered  Vietnamese coffee it was nothing like the original Vietnamese coffee that I’ve always known. The coffee was warm and the ice melted and it tasted like ice melted in black coffee. Very disappointed."
46,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Tasty food and professional staff.
47,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Even though major restrictions applied during this period, we had take away phô and it was good.

Great friendly service though! Would recommend when they are open!"

49,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice Vietnamese food. The best I have tried in Amsterdam so far. Make a reservation for dinner because the place is not big and it is popular.

55,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food is great and the price suited the location but the poor service is the thing I really don't like. After we sat for 15-20 minutes no one came to take an order. The waitress came next to my table to clear the dish several times but she …
56,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Vietnamese Pho place I like most in town. Their pho soup is very well prepared and best recommend the summer rolls! Also try the home made ice tea. If you are coffee lover, the Vietnamese coffee is good too."
57,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really tasty food. Price is fine and kind of average for europe. Nevertheless, the service could be a little bit faster and more attentive. The table was a little bit dirty and not cleaned before we were seated."
58,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent Pho slightly off the beaten path in Amsterdam. Lively atmosphere only to be outdone by the vocal staff cooking and shouting at each other below. On short-staffed days, be sure to not be in a hurry because odds are it'll be a while. Still worth a visit when in the neighborhood though."
59,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I caught a cold while in Amsterdam and was craving something warm and comforting. So I quickly googled the closest pho restaurant to where I was and	 Ô MAI popped up. We got there and the restaurant was empty, I ordered the pho dac biet …"

72,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 1 star ,3 years ago,Ordered chicken noodle soup and it was horrible - smelled and tasted like a broth of frozen chicken. I just left it after the very first spoon - it's impossible to eat stinky water. Beef was no better.
73,√î MAI Vietnamees Restaurant, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is oki, pho is good, but the service is rude and slow, sitting there for half hour without a drop of water being served. Trying to pay, the waiter pretend not to see me. Don’t let it destroy your mode, there are better places"
