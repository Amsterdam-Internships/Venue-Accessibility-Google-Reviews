0,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,a month ago,Wonderful place to lunch before/after exploring the Botanical Gardens. Consider calling ahead and booking a reservation so you can easily get a table when you’d like too. Everything was delicious - but - they sprinkle magic dust on their barbecue chips to make them extra delicious!
1,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Ordered the cauliflower and the jumbo scallops. The cauliflower had a pleasant texture, crispy on the outside (no overly crispy or crunchy) and tender on the inside. Still on the fence regarding the sweet and sour sauce that it's sprinkled …"

Got the house made chips and they had sugar and spices on them, a must have. My husband had a spicy margarita which was on point if you like it spicy. The chocolate semi-fredo for dessert was cold and very refreshing."
12,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great stop after an easy hike through the cactus gardens. Great selection on wine, beer, and specialty cocktails!  Staff are friendly and nice.  Soups were amazing, large is enough for two people. Salads looked amazing, great fresh vegetables and beautifully cooked chicken."
13,Gertrude's Cafe, 4 stars ,a month ago,"The French Dip special didn't live up to the description, especially the not caramelized onions.  Bread got soggy quickly and meat was tough.  However, the Cactus Cosmo and service was outstanding.  Nice ambience too."
14,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"The food here was top quality and tasted great! I ordered the smoked tofu, which was delicious. It was drizzled in mango sauce which really made the flavors pop. Unfortunately the portion was a little small for a full meal so I had to add …"

18,Gertrude's Cafe, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"The service was less than expected for the price point. You now need to wait twice in line. One to pick up the menu and once to order, which you do at the entrance.  The dip sandwich and chips were tasty but the berry crumble was way too …"

22,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Great mid day meal. My son had The Hot Mess from the breakfast menu and he gobbled it up. It was quite tasty from my taste of the bit that was left. The fried tofu was crunchy and well flavored and the doughnut holes were delicious.

31,Gertrude's Cafe, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Nice place to eat at the gardens. The prices are typical but you have to pay to get into the gardens first, which ups the ante. A variety of Southwest fare. Their salsa is yummy.  Outdoor and indoor tables."

51,Gertrude's Cafe, 1 star ,2 months ago,Gertrude's has gone downhill.  Food is not as good as it used to be.   Both Host and Hostess yelled at me as I was putting on a mask per their requirements because I wasn't doing it fast enough to satisfy them.  It was rude and embarrassing.  I will NEVER dine there again!

My food came out cold, it had to be sent back, and and they lost my husband’s food. Our waiter sent someone else out to bring us our check(guess he didn’t want to deal with us). Not great. Won’t be back. Really disappointed."

95,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Fantastic food and great service. You can't beat the beautiful setting. The outdoor patio has heaters. You need a reservation.

96,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,5 months ago,This place is awesome and super good food. Only thing that’s silly to me is they still make you put on a mask just to walk through the doors and literally take it off two steps in.
97,Gertrude's Cafe, 1 star ,7 months ago,"There were flies everywhere! Not just a fly or two, literally all over the restaurant and one dropped in our carrot hummus.

104,Gertrude's Cafe, 2 stars ,a year ago,"At best, it was mediocre. Our server was great, and the atmosphere was lovely, but the majority of the food was disappointing, especially considering the price. Out of six of us, maybe one completely liked their meal. The sides and drinks were great, but burgers were overcooked and entrees were bland."
105,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Waitstaff were very personal and welcoming. They knew about all the good sites to visit in the city. Food was on point. Coming from the East coast, who wouldn't want to sit in a patio surrounded by cactuses. Went there a few times on my trip. Definitely an oasis in the desert."

110,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, nice setting and reasonable prices (at least by NYC standards) given that the guests are, in a sense, captive, since there aren't other dining options close by."
111,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and conviniently located right next to the Desert Botanical Garden. It's pricy but worth it if you are looking for a fine dining experience.
112,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"First of all - I rarely experience (limited) fine dining menus. Second of all I expect to enjoy the pricer items when I do. Last, and importantly, I sincerely enjoyed the foods, beverage selections, and services, and so to did my Granddaughter."

118,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Called because I was going to be late to my reservation at 7:30pm, they told me because i called they would still seat me but informed me the kitchen closes at 8pm. Excellent customer service and amazing food, 10/10 will be coming back."
119,Gertrude's Cafe, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice atmosphere, service was good, food was not as good. The hummus appetizer was very good, but my entrée was just ok and my wife's was so salty it was barely edible. It was a decent experience overall but I don't think we'll be back."
120,Gertrude's Cafe, 3 stars ,10 months ago,Atmosphere was nice. Our server was fantastic. The biggest problem we had was all the food was bland even with all the ingredients they use. It is pretty pricey for just okay food.
121,Gertrude's Cafe, 4 stars ,a month ago,Interesting menu. Nice outdoor dining with great food and service.
122,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,11 months ago,My wife and I ate here after seeing the gardens. The menu is full of vegan options that go above and beyond the standard offerings. We ordered several dishes and still didn't manage to try everything-- which was a relief when most menus have one dairy-free option at most.
123,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Really good food and decent portions in a lovely atmosphere. A bit limited in selection but everything is tasty and not something you'd get everywhere. Nice drink menu as well.

126,Gertrude's Cafe, 1 star ,a year ago,This place is terrible. We ordered the Korean thighs and the chicken was DRY and it looked OLD. The Thai noodles were not what I expected. We exchanged it for potatoes and they looked like they were from breakfast . The cook or server came …

129,Gertrude's Cafe, 4 stars ,9 months ago,This is usually a 5 star place. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I don't care for the current menu. The pre-pandemic menu was killer. They had a martini/cosmo drink that was a nectar from the gods and a menu that left you …
130,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Gertrude's is back and with a new cover over the outside dinning area. Even with Covid-19 it's a great place to eat. Food, service and health adjustment  all were great. We did Luminaries after just an outstanding date night. Really suggest reservation due to reduced seating."

132,Gertrude's Cafe, 3 stars ,9 months ago,Food was good. On the expensive side but we'll prepared. Don't expect to sit inside without a reservation. We sat outside in the heat while the entire inside was vacant throughout our lunch. Makes no sense.
133,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,4 months ago,A few more choices would have been nice.  The hummus was a little runny. But.. enjoyable.
134,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,a year ago,This one is a bit of a mixed review.. the food was good and so was the service and the ambiance was superb at night. The heaters were also a plus. The main negative which couldn't be helped and unfortunately was a nuisance was the bugs ‍♂️ …
135,Gertrude's Cafe, 4 stars ,a year ago,Very nice venue. Farm to table menu may limit some choices but very good if you find what you like. Good service and you can't beat the outdoor ambiance sitting in the garden.

148,Gertrude's Cafe, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good... just not great.  I would expect more from a restaurant that averages about $25 for a lunch entree.  Cauliflower appetizer was very good, but would have been nice if they put more than 3 shishito peppers in the dish instead …"

170,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Multiple vegan and vegetarian options.  Our server was friendly and attentive, wish I could remember his name.  We had the polenta bowl and the grain and seeds bowl, both were pleasant whole food surprises.  Maybe a little overpriced, but worth it as part of the Botanical Garden visit."
171,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My mom and I eat here every year before we walk the Luminarias. Wonderful service, delicious food, and gorgeous atmosphere. It's only been better every year we've gone. Their seasoning and wine selections are to die for."

185,Gertrude's Cafe, 1 star ,8 months ago,I’m visited Arizona for vacation and everywhere we visited did not require a mask but Gertrudes required one after we walked in 110 degrees in the heat and then tried to make us wear a mask. We just took our business elsewhere. The staff was also rude. Won’t ever be back.
186,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We tried this place after a friend of ours recommended it and loved it. It's the type of restaurant you go to if you want to hang out and not be rushed.  We enjoy going out to eat and not being turned out in 45 min or less. We hung out for …

199,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was exquisite, service fantastic. Highly reccomended."
200,Gertrude's Cafe, 4 stars ,5 years ago,If you love Mexican food this is the place to try. Great variety of tacos and other dishes. Margarhitas are excellent. Service is great. Ambiance is typical of cafeteria type arrangement and exterior may scare some away. Don!t be one of them. This place ranks right up there with best Mexican food.

206,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,a year ago,Beautiful and wonderful experience! Always at the top places we bring our out of town or local friends. A plus that's it located inside of the botanical garden.

220,Gertrude's Cafe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Corn Fritters topped with Aioli and fresh Cotija cheese IS A MUST TRY APPETIZER. Easily my favorite item of the night.

266,Gertrude's Cafe, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Very pretty restaurant,  very nice service. Really the only reason they have a star. The food was flavorless and dry. I would rather eat McDonald's than eat here again. Gorgeous location though."
267,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great little oasis in the Desert Botanical Gardens (separate entrances, garden entry is not required). Gertrude's is one of my go-to stops whenever I'm in Phoenix and the patio is more than enough desert garden for most people; myself included."
268,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious seasonal menus and great service. Love sitting on the patio surrounded by the beauty of nature.
269,Gertrude's Cafe, 1 star ,5 years ago,Wanted to take my girlfriend to a nice relaxing desert before the Bruce Morano light show. Ordered Berry - Lemon aid and donuts holes with sauce. The lemon - aid tasted like tap water with a squirt of lemon juice from the bottle. Lady next to us said have then add vodka. Talked to the host he just blew me off. NEVER AGAIN!

274,Gertrude's Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,Worst Service Ever. It's based on Racial Profilings. Very Racist especially the waiter. I don't recommend this to any one. Besides the burger cost $18. It just not right.
275,Gertrude's Cafe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Stellar food (some of the best chefs in AZ have worked or currently work here) and great people. Take a walk around the garden and finish the evening with a great meal (and maybe a drink on the patio)
