2,Caf√© 't Loosje, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Very rude staff! “You don’t have to be here!” The guy refused to serve us at the bar and as we were waiting for a car pickup, the waitress came to turn off the heating lamp outside (the terrace was empty) ha ha ha! Too bad it’s a beautiful place and I’ve had many lovely moments there in the past."
3,Caf√© 't Loosje, 1 star ,4 months ago,"The staff left us to stand in the doorway for ages while we waited to be QR scanned. The food is very limited (no fries ).. the burger bun was rock hard.

7,Caf√© 't Loosje, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool, relaxed setting positioned in front of a market place on a Saturday, good atmosphere. Then we eventually got served... 'Pint' was 3/4 full. Toastie (chorizo & cheese) took 45 minutes to come out, was bone dry and very average. Think I could've rustled one up better at home."
8,Caf√© 't Loosje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A well-rounded joint in the centre of Amsterdam. Great service, food well above average, good beer. What else can one ask for. I was glad to leave a tip (although not required in these lands). I would certainly recommend it and come back."

14,Caf√© 't Loosje, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice laid back place. Great for watching life go by. A smart selection of drinks and value for money food. My personal fav. If I had to choose would be eggs from the oven. Their nacho platter feeds a table. Highly recommended.

19,Caf√© 't Loosje, 1 star ,3 years ago,Got handed the worst pint of my life in this bar....if you gave this to a person in ireland it would cause a riot. I poured it into the half pint glass beside it and it was actually less than half a pint

33,Caf√© 't Loosje, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I hate to give one star as I feel it's rarely fair to owners. However, I faced real shady practices in this bar tonight: the owner refused to split our bill (50€+ bill) because ""it's too busy tonight we can't split bills"" then refused to produce an invoice for my company which I needed to reimburse this meal."

35,Caf√© 't Loosje, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The staff here were incredibly rude to me and my friends as soon as we entered and continued to harass us until we left, telling us to go and drink on the street where it's illegal to carry open containers of alcohol.
