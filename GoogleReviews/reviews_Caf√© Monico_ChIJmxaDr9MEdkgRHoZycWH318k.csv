0,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved herena our waitress she was kind and lovely. This was a better experience than Sexy Fish! Good food, pasta cooked correctly and a nice fresh selection on the menu.  Service was extraordinary even with no reservation and a time constraint for dinner as I needed to go to a show. Worth the money and trip."
1,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely gem on Shaftesbury Avenue. Great decor but not pretentious. Prices are very reasonable and the food is lovely. Makes a welcome addition in amongst some of touristy restaurants in the area
2,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful Art Deco style cafe, great team, I like a good service. It was mostly great, but my sirloin steak was a bit overcooked other then that it was perfect. I know tiramisu is a basic dessert but I love it and it was delicious"

8,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Exceptional service and environment. Ask for a table upstairs as the views over the chandelier and the bar are great in the evenings with dimmed lights. The set menu for dinner offer three choices with 2 or 3 course options avaliable.
9,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I am visiting London for business very often, at least three times a month. Organizing always business dinners with colleagues and partners. This was one of the worse experiences we ever had. …"
10,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We visited Cafe Monico last week as we were early for the theatre and so we stopped in for a drink. It was a very nice bar which we would definitely visit again if we had the opportunity
11,Caf√© Monico, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Been coming here for a few years now and never really had any problem but yesterday was quite bad. I ordered the beetroot burger (1 of 2 dishes that could be made vegan) and received a lukewarm burger with some old stale bread- the waitress …

17,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good theatre menu, but you have to ask to get the offer which includes the free glass of prosecco. Good quality food and chic surroundings."
18,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely small restaurant in the heart of the west end.  We had booked and were given a nice table upstairs.  Staff were polite and friendly,  but sometimes the service could have been a little quicker. We had a pre-theatre menu which came …"

20,Caf√© Monico, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The venue itself is amazing. We sat upstairs overlooking the bar and the atmosphere was great. …
21,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,2 years ago,We arrived at 7pm and were served drinks. Unfortunately we waited for 30 mins and still hadn't had the order taken for our mains. There were barely any waiters around and the ones we could see were focused on serving a very large table. We …
22,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good menu - not too little choice and not too much. Food is delicious and beautifully presented.  Cocktails also very good - have their own concoctions which make a nice change from the usual. Very nice setting and atmosphere. Excellent service. Reasonably priced.
23,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good restaurant. We booked before Les Mis which is right next door. The service was pretty good although they didn’t top up our glasses from the bottle of wine we ordered at any point during dinner. Having said that; food arrived in good …
24,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had few cocktails with friends at the bar. Some French fries nicely cooked, crunchy and tasty. Cocktails were delicious. I'll have dinner next time I visit. Great place"
25,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really beautiful bar in the centre of the space with seating around the outside. We were sat upstairs and it was lovely. I had the cheeseburger, which was very meaty and well cooked. The service was fine, but nothing special. Great place for a group catch up"
26,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A really nice cafe with a European feel. Relaxed and enjoyable. We only went for drinks. The ambience is great. Nice and clean. Fair prices for West End. Nice friendly staff. Enjoy the place before it gets very well known.
27,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We had a reservation for 7.45pm, we waited 30 minutes until we were sat and that was after having to ask the host again which he seemed to have forgotten us. The waiter blatantly ignored us and spoke to tables that were sat after us and we …"
28,Caf√© Monico, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Been a customer for a while of Cafe Mónico, however, over the last year it has gone down in service and atmosphere. Last night when I stopped by for a drink, it took a while for the order to get prepared, they are under staffed, I didn't …"
29,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really cool place. Fine food (nothing spectacular) and great ambience downtown. I would definitely prefer it to be less... noisy, but that's London; most of the places are super noisy. Also very limited number of whiskey etiquettes which is super weird for a place like this."
30,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a lovely meal with my family. Great food, steak portions were generous, calamari perfectly done. Atmosphere was great and staff were very attentive. Fab value for money."
31,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Popped in before going to a show, really good bar service friendly and quick, made great cocktails, open kitchen, so you can see your food being prepped, tables downstairs and upstairs looking down onto bar. Really nice atmosphere, quick service and reasonable prices."
32,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is fab - the four of us that dined together are collectively not that easy to please but the verdict was unanimous- we loved it. The food is great - steaks were mouthwatering, champagne chilled to perfection, desserts might be …"
33,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We popped in on the off chance that cafe Monica had space on a busy Saturday evening. The hosts were so lovely and did everything in their power to find us a table. We ended up by the bar where we had amazing service, yummy food and …"
34,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,3 years ago,Unfortunately we had a bad experience at this restaurant despite our positive expectations after reading the reviews. Service was okay - we had to wait about ten minutes before we ordered our drinks but they were busy so we understood. …
35,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Went here last night before the theatre, we ate vegan and had the stuffed aubergine and the aubergine pasta and a side of fries.  We experienced excellent service and the food was really delicious, there were a few vegan dishes, but these …"
36,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had dinner with 5 friends. We all had starters and mains, although no one could manage desert! My chicken liver pate was good but the rump steak for two was particularly well cooked. Not sure there was a choice of sauces with the steak but …"
37,Caf√© Monico, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not that impressed for a central London restaurant. The food was ok but rather tasteless but there were a few dishes that were tasty. The staff were a bit aloof and our waiter concentrated on a table of ladies as opposed to our table of 8.
Not sure I'd go back but the food was well priced but nothing special."
38,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely place for lunch, the portions are very generous. When we went it was quiet and their was only one waitir serving. So the service wasn't  great but the food and cocktails were amazing."
39,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I have been here once before and know the portions are small. But even by this standard, the portion sizes were laughable tonight. They were tiny. I was with a couple of friends and they both ordered steak. One steak was half the size of …"

49,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Underrated and fantastic surprising little place for a delicious, adequately priced, comfortable and cosy dinner before a show in the west end. I love it here and bring all my out of town guests when we go to the theater nearby."
50,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"From Gabriella at the desk to the quality of food, drink and service this is one of those comfortable and stimulating places to meat, eat and drink in central London. Ground floor and the window to Shaftesbury Avenue or more discrete …"
51,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Had dinner here. Chose to go for the set menu, so maybe this is why the quality was poor. But then on the other hand - how bad can it get? My partner went for risotto- and when it came we were shocked! It was served on a flat plate and it …"
52,Caf√© Monico, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Unfortunately in England the servers get tipped 22% whether or not they provide excellent service (at this restaurant). I asked the server if they had any rye whiskey. He didn't even know what that was! Do the English not drink rye …
53,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great Service, Great value food and and not a Tourist Trap. You go for the set menus which are unbelievably priced (£14 for 2 courses - Nov 16) or go for the a la carte with more options and bigger portions. Service here is exceptional. I've been three times in the past month (after my first visit)"
54,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,5 years ago,We came here just for a cocktail and ended up having three each! 🙊🙊🙊 good service and beautiful place - too good for such a touristy location! Can't give it 5 stars because the Bellini was served in a normal glass! What?
55,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Went here woth my wife and son on hos recommendation. Lovely place with a great atmosphere and lovely jazzy music in the background. Food was really nice either from set or maim menus and all resonably priced. For 3 of us for 2 courses and wine was about £75. Staff really attentive and service was slick.
56,Caf√© Monico, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Ambiance is nice - but food not great and pricey for what it is.
Food (including fish) served on cold plates
Mussels starter tasteless …"

58,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We went here for drinks and small bites and the atmosphere was great, great background music, not too busy when we arrived, we got a good table and chatted the night away. The service from the waiter downstairs at the back was excellent!"
59,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Given its location I was expecting overpriced and lazy, but the breakfasts here at least are good value and taste great. …"
60,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Oddly quiet little place in central on a Saturday morning, but don't be put off by that. Easily one of the better breakfasts I've had around (they'll do a half English if you're not in the mood for a belly bursting Full), coffee was lovely and vibrant andd the service was even better, the banter was necessary to offset my hangover."
61,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Lovely new restaurant from Soho House & Co. The layout is perfect, most tables offering a private space and a good view around the restaurant. The food is traditional European cuisine, excellently executed. Plenty of vegetarian options too."
62,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,5 years ago,"High prices, the Cappuccino wasn't good, the beer was flat, and the tiramisù was only cream, not biscuit at all, i don't suggest it."
63,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A little touch of Parisian glamour with great food, friendly staff and a good location. Love the oysters, the tartare and the steaks! Excellent cocktails. Avoid the sister restaurant, Cafe Boheme, and come here!"
64,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Our servers were lovely and very attentive. It's a beautiful room with well balanced food and a very reasonable tasting menu. Would definitely come back.
65,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Wanted a restaurant for a special early dinner close to the Queens Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue. Booked on line via Bookatable, easy. Walked from our hotel in Soho 5 mins came round the corner Restaurant next door to the Theatre, Winner! …"
66,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Had a fantastic dining experience here the other night with my boyfriend. Every waiter was very courteous and was helpful in making rexommomendations. The steak tartare was one of the best I ever had. I think the chips were perfectly crispy …
67,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"If you’re looking for the best brunch spot on Shaftesbury Avenue, you have to get yourself to Café Monico, a vintage style brasserie that serves delicious food no matter what time of day. After a late-morning stroll through the theater …"
68,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible service. Rude and lazy staff. The service and unprofessional attitude of the staff  do not make up for the over priced drinks and ridiculous waiting time. Felt like I was inconveniencing them by simply trying to buy a drink. Would not recommend wasting your money here. 0 star experience.
69,Caf√© Monico, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Okay food. So-so service. Great wine list,  the carafe is value for money.  Noise a bit offputing. Background music not in the background, which combined with the acoustics was annoying. Minestrone soup a disaster. Tuna Nicoise salad actually brilliant.  Anchovies,  boiled new potatoes and crisp romaine, haricotes. Solid mixology."
70,Caf√© Monico, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Elegant art deco ambience with good variety cocktails. Helpful, friendly staff and conveniently located adjacent Gielgud Theatre. Good to pop in for pre or post show food and drink."
71,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quiet cafe,  reasonably priced- delicious food!"
72,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very classy restaurant with a 1930's vibe. We ate a pre-theatre menu which was great value at £20 for three courses with a glass of Prosecco. Very nice food. Will certainly return.
73,Caf√© Monico, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not too bad, given the touristy location, but I wouldn't take a detour. Calimari was tough and although moules were well cooked the accompanying fries were parsimonious and bland. Also, how can Moules Mariniere not come with bread to mop up the juices!?"
74,Caf√© Monico, 1 star ,3 years ago,Never been anywhere with such rude staff! Took an hour and a half to get starters on the table! Food was appalling. Example: The risotto was made out of Basmati instead of Arborio  and the waitress poured wine into my water glass. Seriously …
75,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"one of the best places ive been to. amazing nostalgic atmosphere on 1930s paris, perfect old jazz music and lighting. great design and attention to detail. friendly staff, great food for very vlgood prices! i will become a regular for sure!!!"
76,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent food. Menu had something for everyone. Staff couldn't have more attentive. Loved the background music. Jazzy. It was my 2nd visit and there will definitely be a 3rd and 4th......
77,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Two weeks in on my three weeks trip in London, came across this restaurant randomly and it was the best dinner so far. Not pretentious, attentive service, good vibe and most importantly, the food is much better than I expected."
78,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food, but I can't in good conscience give it five stars considering how much it would have been at full price. It's very good, but not exceptional. Weak beer list too."
79,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Solid brasserie experience and well executed. Nice ambiance, friendly and capable staff and simple but excellent food. Don't be put off by the Shaftsbury Avenue location."
80,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great cocktails! The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides were delicious! Great little place in the middle of busy Shaftesbury Av.
81,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Superb service.

Attentive and chatty staff. …"
82,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great for Queens theatre in both location (one minute away) plus pre-theatre deal available 3 courses and prosecco for £20!! Intimate, vibrant atmosphere with soft jazz (melodic not free syle) and lighting to suit a romantic evening. Would recommend."
83,Caf√© Monico, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I recommend another menu not steak
84,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good restaurants around Piccadilly is becoming the norm (thankfully) and this establishment is no exception. Mostly French classics with some Italian. An attentive waitstaff and good food  what's not to love.

90,Caf√© Monico, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the pre theatre menu. Of three main dishes on offer, one was not available (this was before 7pm). I had two vegetarian dishes, neither tasted of anything. Not good, really not good."

95,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Food and staff were fantastic. The only thing that put me off was i asked for a Disaronno and diet coke and i was looked at like a crazy person. He said i will do it seperate and you mix yourself which i thought was odd.
96,Caf√© Monico, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely Valentine meal with five wonderful people, Cafe decor was amazing, food and company great and the Champagne superb. Definitely will be back."
97,Caf√© Monico, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good cocktails and a nice ambiance. The selection of beers is average, so if that's what you are after then I would suggest looking elsewhere."

111,Caf√© Monico, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The food selection is very poor. The dish I selected was watery and testless. Nothing special. I returned to Cafe Monico after few years to give it one more chance but its gone worse..sorry
112,Caf√© Monico, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very central London location and not to busy after 19:30 when the theatre crowd leave, but still took quite a while for food to arrive.  The food isn’t very good.  Avoid."
