0,Pahop Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We loved eating here - the best glass noodles I have ever had. The service was lovely and ultimately the family that owned this restaurant were really sweet. The owner beckoned is inside after looking at the menu and we weren’t …
1,Pahop Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Seriously cannot understand the bad reviews for this place. This is some of the best Thai I have ever had...and I have had a lot of Thai food! The roasted duck was amazing! The chicken yellow curry was as well. The owner was lovely! Highly recommend this place.
2,Pahop Thai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I don’t usually leave a rating, just feel the restaurant deserve a better rating. The food is great and authentic, the environment may not fancy as you thought but if you are looking for some good Thai food this would be a great option."
3,Pahop Thai, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Absolutely delicious food and very good value, particularly the one-plate-meals at the start of the menu. Two of us had a starter, a main course and a beer each and the total bill was under €40 altogether. Friendly but unobtrusive service, and in a great part of the city if you want to visit a good bar after the meal."
4,Pahop Thai, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I had a green curry craving and ran over to Pahop Thai. The food was ready quickly, was tasty and there was lots of tofu in my dish! I have eaten here before and am always happy."
5,Pahop Thai, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible service, they treated us very bad and we spend quite some money there.
Toilet very very dirty and just not a nice place.
Too bad because the food was decent but not wow. Canned drinks and tap water €2."
6,Pahop Thai, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Worst food ever!!! I ordered pad thai and after a few bites i tossed the food away, it tasted very strange,gooey and dripping in oil and nothing like Thai food, over salted and plain weird. We got very bad food poisoning. Would never EVER recommend this to anyone!"

10,Pahop Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice Pad Thai and papaya salad
11,Pahop Thai, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Pad Thai was very good but the man that served wasn't too friendly. He might have had a bad day, for the food alone I'd go back."

15,Pahop Thai, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) It was unbelievable that it was badly rated. Close to the taste of a real food stand.
The service was normal as well, and I went for lunch, but it was a great answer. …"
16,Pahop Thai, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Cheap fine food. But something can still happen to the service. The floor of the toilet looked as if there had been a minor earthquake, and from previous comments it has been for some time. The toilet seat looked so …"
17,Pahop Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,(Translated by Google) Really recommended !! Don't be put off by the fact that the tent looks a bit moodless. The food is amazing! The lady who cooks the food is very sweet and gives you advice when you can't choose. The yellow curry is …
18,Pahop Thai, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) They were looking for an Indonesian restaurant, but they were all busy, at 6.00 pm they were the only visitors here in the evening, the price tag was not cheap, the restaurant was authentic, family, and hung up photos …"
19,Pahop Thai, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"(Translated by Google) A little hidden away between the market stalls is this eatery whose interior is in urgent need of replacement. Or at least a lick of paint. But don't be fooled, the dishes taste excellent. We have already collected …"
