1,Lunchroom Grannies, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Cozy atmosphere, delicious food, big portions. Highly recommend!"
2,Lunchroom Grannies, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Amazing food, the best owners and a satisfied tummy. Grannies is fantastic on multiple level and has now become my go-to for those more continental cravings (including the famous Dutch food) ‚Ä¶"
3,Lunchroom Grannies, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is really sweet, with really good food at a good price. The guys running it were very friendly and the service was excellent, though during the lunch rush it seemed understaffed. They could do with a great barista to take the coffee to the next level. But it's a really charming place with tasty food and a lot of heart."
4,Lunchroom Grannies, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Could easily be listed as a top 10 cafes in Amsterdam. Ranks right up there with MOEDERS. Food is very hearty and very Dutch. We had the meatloaf(!) and quiche. Farmers omelette looked tasty too.  Both were amazing.  Decor is very unique ‚Ä¶
