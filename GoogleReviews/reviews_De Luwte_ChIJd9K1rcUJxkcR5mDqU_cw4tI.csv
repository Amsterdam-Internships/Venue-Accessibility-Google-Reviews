0,De Luwte, 5 stars ,a week ago,Such a cosy atmosphere and the food was amaaazing! From starters to dessert everything was so delicious and the service is outstanding specially Yeral. We will definitely be back!
1,De Luwte, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Very disappointing, inexperienced and untrained staff. The waitresses are friendly and try their best. It is clearly that this restaurant manager doesn’t train on basic restaurant skills. For example food doesn’t arrive at the same time on …"

3,De Luwte, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good service and the duck was really well done. A bit small for me, but ok. Interesting wine selection and good draft Weiss bier. Place is very comfortable and stylish. Would come back for sure."
4,De Luwte, 1 star ,5 months ago,"This was so disappointing, went for lunch and waited 45 minutes for the avocado toast and club sandwich, which was not great. The waitresses sat inside at a table talking with who seemed to be the owner and ignored the customers, it was so frustrating . Definitely won’t go back here as they have absolutely no customer service."
5,De Luwte, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Good food and not to expensive prices for some dishes to share. Very nice waitress and charming ambience.
6,De Luwte, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice spot. Service and food was good. We had the chopped salad and the pasta aglio e olio
7,De Luwte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The first time I was there I had the best scallops I've tried; for dessert I had the cheesecake which is amazing! That time the service was just outstanding.

8,De Luwte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We were lucky enough to cycle by on a warm and almost-late evening hoping to eat here without reservations. And so we did. Everything as you'd want it to be: good service, fine food, and just the right ambience."
9,De Luwte, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent food and service in a cosy and warm atmosphere. It's a little jem and a must go place if you are in Amsterdam.
10,De Luwte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a delightful little restaurant, it's located in a quite residential area on one of Amsterdam's cannels. The food here is exquisite. It's not cheap but it's well worth the money and well worth a visit."
11,De Luwte, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good atmosphere. Duck was really tasty. Service was questionable, but might have been unlucky with our waitress."
12,De Luwte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best restaurant I had in Amsterdam. Michelin grade tenderloin for only €25 (dinner). Wow~~

16,De Luwte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely restaurant. We went in early on a Saturday evening only to find they were fully booked but they offered us a table until 8pm which was fine. We had the ""catch of the day"" which was delicious and beautifully cooked. All the staff were …"
17,De Luwte, 5 stars ,a year ago,If you're an American tourist please stop at this restaurant!!! Amazing food to the point that I haven't tasted anything this fresh before. The staff are so friendly and spoke English to me perfectly and made me feel so welcomed. Awesome atmosphere to be in right by the canal too. Try the edameme its to die for.
18,De Luwte, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is advertised as French cuisine but it's basically typical Dutch  food and the menu has little to nothing to do with French cuisine.
As usual in a modern Dutch place, the selection is very limited so if you're …"

20,De Luwte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went recently on a Sunday night without a reservation. Very friendly service and a dark, warming ambience with really nice interior decor. The food was great (I had a burrata starter and duck confit main) and fairly priced for the quality …"
21,De Luwte, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Looking at the reviews it's somewhat overrated. The food is okay but not great, it's a bit outdated modern presented on the plate.

22,De Luwte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent quality and menu range, brilliant vegetarian options and great cuts of meat - I highly recommend the venison steak, it was one of the best I've ever had. Excellent service with very good knowledge of the whole running of a restaurant and proper etiquette - better than most places in the UK!"
23,De Luwte, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I came here two days in a row because of how friendly the staff was and because of their warm drinks. Coffee was good, but hot chocolate was better. Prices are okay, but the friendly service made it worth it."
24,De Luwte, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A lovely neighborhood restaurant with both tourists and local people, warm and welcoming.  The staff convey an unobtrusive, relaxed and congenial ambiance. I had a question about an entree I was unsure about and the waitress let me try a …"
25,De Luwte, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice canal side restaurant, friendly wait staff (although they did disappear for a little bit) and the food was quite good. Scallops were well cooked if only seared on one side. The pasta was complex but tasty and the other main good but forgettable."
26,De Luwte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent restaurant with fantastic service. Sebastian was a great laugh and helpful with wine selections to go with food.

29,De Luwte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely amazing experience! The service was impeccable with all servers being attentive and polite; the location is amazing with a view over a canal; and the food was one of the best food experiences I've ever had! Slightly pricey but worth everything!!!
30,De Luwte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Attentive and knowledgeable staff. Adventurous cuisine that works. Small select menu Clearly an accomplished chef. Fusion cuisine with finesse and style. Wine list/alcohol etc simple and complimentary.  An excellent night out.
31,De Luwte, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food but complex services. Seems they couldn't manage so many guests. Red wines are way too warm (room temp, 23°)"
32,De Luwte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Combine great food and dining with a cosy and quaint setting and you get this wonderful restaurant. Has an Italian theme with food and wine set to it. Has both set menus and a la carte options available. Has a good wine list and some really …
33,De Luwte, 1 star ,4 months ago,Very poor service. I have to ask for literally everything. They do not seem about to make any business.
34,De Luwte, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"We came with very high expectations to this restaurant, but it turned out to be deceptive. The food was mediocre. I had the duck breast, which came to the table cold, and with an unfitting chocolate sauce and a poor side. The iberico pork …"
35,De Luwte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the most wonderful experiences we had here in Amsterdam.  In our stay of 8 days, we have come back 3 or 4 times.  The services is so friendly and the food is right on point.  I absolutely recommend Dr Luwte to anyone who appreciates good food, atmosphere and friendliness."
36,De Luwte, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"One of my favourite restaurants in Amsterdam! Always delicious, good service and in the summer a nice patio. For Your Little Black Book I dine out 3 times a week and De Luwte is one of my best discoveries last year!"

61,De Luwte, 1 star ,2 years ago,"THEY ARE NOT OPEN. We drove all the way there and they’re closed. This has happened multiple times in this city. I don’t know why they are so stupid that they don’t know how to put their hours of operation on Google, but they really are that stupid."
