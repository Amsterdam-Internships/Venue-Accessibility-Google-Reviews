0,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 3 stars ,a month ago,"Caramel chocolate cake was delicious, well-balanced flavours and textures. Portion was decent for the price. However, my experience with this sweet caramel cake was completely soured by the bitter service. Not sure why the counter staff was …"
1,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Tasty cakes, delicious and beautiful bonbons with nice coffee. Although a bit on a high price point they totally worth it.
The interior is very nostalgic and well designed. Little marble tables with …"
2,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Excellent patisserie! You might not be able to snatch a seat inside, but make sure to order same cake for takeaway anyway. The chocolate cake and Swedish princess cake were absolutely divine. Great place to enjoy a pot of tea and cake in between shopping."
3,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The chocolates here were AMAZING! The pies and cakes were almost sold out when we went so if that’s what you’re looking for, I’d suggest going early. Great cappuccino as well!"
4,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great french bakery. Reasonable prices.
5,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,a month ago,Oh my God! the cakes are to die for but the marzipan bombons are something else. Get one of each. You can eat inside but it gets a bit crowded on the weekends. They also have amazing candied fruit and classic florentines! Amazing spot.
6,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My friends said it’s a kinda famous place for chocolate products. The cakes and chocolate are good! There are so many chocolates to choose from, I cannot decide lol."
7,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We walked by, saw the pastries in the window and stepped in. Boy were we happy we did. I had hands down the best apple cake ever and my husband enjoyed a delicious caramel cheesecake. Everything looked delicious and the staff was super friendly and patient in explaining what everything is. We would definitely come back!"
8,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This was one of the best dessert experiences in my life! Especially the chocolate cake. Not too sweet (I would call it mature sweet), but full of flavor! All the 3 cakes we took were of an exceptional taste. I really really enjoyed it here. Definitely recommend!"
9,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Excelent place with delicious cakes and pastries and amazing coffee!

10,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,5 months ago,A tasty tiramisu and a latte macchiato is what I had💯 would definitely recommend and visit again.
11,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Finest quality chocolate and pastries, true to old Amsterdam style. You can also grab a fresh coffee but beware, it's quite small and can be busy often as many people take the chance to go there during their shopping in the 9 streets."
12,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It looks good, but it tastes even better!
This is one of my most favorite cake shop in the ENTIRE WORLD. Their cake combination of flavors are new and creative, such as mocha chocolate walnut, and rich …"
13,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 1 star ,3 months ago,"The taste of the pastries are good, but the staff are not friendly. We were head in the line to get a table and they gave the table to a local couple and didn't apologize."
14,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"I went with very high expectations, but I found the bombons and the cakes just ok, nothing incredible that justifies the price. Only the white chocolate and pistachio mini cakes were really good. Bombons in general quite normal. The pastries were also good."
15,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best patisserie in Amsterdam. Amazing cake selection and each one is tastier that the other. Amazing indeed.
16,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Returned to Pompadour recently for their delectable dark chocolate Orangettes. This is a classy chocolatier and tearoom on Huidenstraat with opening hours of 10-6pm (M-F), 9-6pm (Sat) and 12-6pm (Sun). …"
17,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing authentic place!
Local chocolaterie, with relaxed vibes and lovely owner. …"
18,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Listen, there is nothing like this place. The madeleines are to die for. The service exquisite. Best in town. I could easily wax poetic about this place. Superlatives and all that. Takes you back in time… just fab fab fab."
19,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Incredibly good but service could be better. Don’t think that common politeness when asked about recommendations for cakes is too much to ask (specifically the older gentleman). But really great qualify and cute interior.
20,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very well balanced cakes. The different components weren't overwhelmingly sweet and were very cohesive in texture and taste.
21,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great place to have cakes and hot chocolate. Not so many tabled available, thus you might be asked to wait outside. The staff is warm and friendly."
22,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Our favorite place for brunch if in the city. Delicious freshly made pastries and good coffee. Can be a little busy during weekends.

24,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I Love that place. Each time i visit the city, i pass by for a tea and some pastries.
Chocolate are good too. …"
25,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Yummy hot chocolate. The pastry I tried was alright but probably mostly because it looked like it was chocolate from the outside but wasn’t actually. There are no labels and no one explained what was what. Regardless it was a nice place to stop by and sit at.
26,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Kinda of expensive chocolates and pastries. It was good, but not amazingly good. Wish I liked it more."
27,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty cake
Place is so nice
Prices are a little bit high …"
28,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Rich aromatic chocolates just for 1.75€! Cakes are also great. They have just 6 small tables so take out could be a good idea.
29,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"They have the best sweets! It is the perfect balans between sweetnes and tardiness. My friend and I ordered an raspberry and grean tea cake with grean mousse, a passionfruit tart and jasmin tea. Every penny is worth it, the pastries were so delightful. Would definitely recommend to everyone who loves patisseries."
30,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cosy with tasty pastries, it gives you an old glamour feel inside. The cakes are great as is their hot chocolate, they don’t have a great tea selection though."
31,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"Famous for chocolate and pastries, but don't overlook the savory. They have the best quiche lorraine I've ever tried. The spinach quiche is delicious, but the quiche lorraine is heaven. …"
32,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Panacea of decadence to give you the boost in the midst of your shopping. Good for your eyes and soul. Step back out with a spring in your step.
33,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,a month ago,"One of the best, if not the best, french patisseries in Amsterdam. Nice service also. 100% recommended. Their little financiers are insane."
34,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,8 months ago,A very charming chocolaterie in one of the most gorgeous parts of the city. The sponge cakes are especially lovely! Definitely worth the trip!!!
35,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,a year ago,A dream for cake lovers like myself! They taste all so good. The cakes are little artworks with very well balanced flavours and structures that make for a wonderful feast for the senses. The interior is beautiful and although not original …
36,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I had some cakes and drink. It was tasty.
37,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I like little tea rooms like this where you can drink something while eating a cake. We stepped inside and we were a bit lost. The welcoming wasn't really friendly and we were a bit confused about how to order. Apparently you have to order …
38,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A reasonable selection of pastries for tea or coffee; a little heavy on the mousse-end of the dessert spectrum but their financiers and lemon tart are absolutely outstanding. The rest of the desserts are pretty good, albeit a bit too creamy for my personal taste. Super polite and friendly, and always helpful."
39,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,a year ago,"High quality desserts, looks beautiful tastes beautiful too!"
40,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Delicious pastries, bad behavior to expats!"

50,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Yummy pies and cakes. We tried 5 options. All very good. My favorite was the lemon. Chocolate came in last good but not memorable. The atmosphere was a bit fussy and small to sit down. Especially if you have any kids. Mine were older but if …
51,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"When I planned my trip to Amsterdam last year, I made some research into the different chocolatiers in the city. Since I had limited time, I selected 3 chocolatiers, but got a good variety of products at each of them. Pompadour came out on …"
52,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We had fantastic cappuccino here, served with a tiny complimentary almond cake. We tried the ham/cheese and cheese/ginger tosti (a kind of thin grilled cheese sandwich), plus fresh-squeezed orange juice (actually watched them squeeze it!) …"
53,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing pastries and a chouette space inside.
54,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Quite a small and fancy looking place. Great desserts, both visually and in taste! Most desserts are the same price (€5) so going for the biggest one might be worth it if you want to get full. Some are smaller yet packed with flavor."
55,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My fav place in Amsterdam. It has such good cakes! Cannot get enough of them. I loved the meringue and raspberries the most.
56,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice spot to taste delicious things!
57,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cozy little place for cake and coffee in Amsterdam.  Apple pie and cakes are really good and staff is very friendly.  Prices are not too bad and there is quite a bit of indoor seating.

59,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious hot chocolate the way it should.be and delectable chocolate bites. Careful!
60,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"That's what I call a hidden gem. They serve great hot chocolate, not something based on cacao powder, real hot chocolate. Cakes are amazing. And if you're there for a lunch - try one of their quiches."
61,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very testy deserts. My warm recommendation
62,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 1 star ,4 years ago,"TERRIBLE! It was my second visit. The first time was OK, but this time I had taken guests and arrived at 5:40 pm, but the attendant put us out saying that the shop was closed. I'd walked more than 2 km with 2 kids and I felt disrespected …"
63,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Their apple cake is amazing. So is the little cake that accompanies their range of coffee drinks. Clean toilets and obviously popular among the locals. The man and woman running it are quietly hospitable and efficient.
64,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One word: delicious! A must visit in Amsterdam.
65,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great shop for pastries and tea.  I never miss it when I'm in Amsterdam.  If it's too crowded I take my pastry across the street to the little coffee shop.  It is, after all, Amsterdam."
66,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best patisserie in town. If you have time stop by for a coffee and a slice of cake. You won't regret it :) no need to say that also chocolate is mind blowing.
67,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The greatest madeleines in Amsterdam. Great collection of cakes and chocolate and really nice interior. If they are full definitely wait for a spot it will be worth the wait.

71,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Fine chocolate and pastries - you can buy Valrhona chocolate here, but mostly they sell lovely truffles and pastries made with it. There are also a few tables where you can sit and drink tea, coffee, or fine hot chocolate."

78,Chocolaterie Pompadour, 5 stars ,3 years ago,It’s a tiny place with welcoming staff & delicious sweets. You can chill & have a cake or tarts with cup of coffee. Or just get some fine chocolates.
