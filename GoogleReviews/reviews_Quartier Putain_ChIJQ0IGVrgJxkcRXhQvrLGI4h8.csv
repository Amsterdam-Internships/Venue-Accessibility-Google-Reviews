11,Quartier Putain, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a hidden gem in the red light district. I was a bit disappointed to know they ran out of their home made apple pie that day. I guess you'll have to go a bit early, I think we went there around 6-7 pm. …"
12,Quartier Putain, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is very cozy. We had some apple cake and a hot chocolate and a cappuccino. The staff was really nice explaining us where the name of this cafe comes from (it isn't as simple as one might think!) and giving us discounts for other activities.

17,Quartier Putain, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A great stop for a break alongside the oldest building in Amsterdam! This place is run by two guys who care about their customers.

30,Quartier Putain, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Another great place to have a breakfast in town!

37,Quartier Putain, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good-quality coffee, which is difficult to find in this chaotic, typical neighborhood.
