0,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Had a really good time at the restaurant. The waitress and owner were super friendly and the food was delicious. This restaurant it’s a good “cost benefit”, you can find lunch and dinner options starting 9 euros (which for Amsterdam is super cheap) - really good pasta options! Beer was cold, delicious and fair price! I recommend it!"
1,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Not half that bad. We ordered a 3 pizzas and 3 times pasta. Everybody was satisfied with the food. …
2,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Great food and the staff were super nice to us.  Good place to spend time with family, including children! I’ll come back for sure!"
3,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Tucked Away in Rembrandt Square Cosy Little Italian   Beautiful Inside      Very Near to The Three Sisters Pub
4,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Waitress very friendly, waiter was NOT❗ Anti pasta was a dissapointment."
5,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 months ago,Ice creams are not good at all. Lazy and unrespectful service. We waited 15 minutes to get the bill in order to pay. Should have left without paying considering how pitifull the experience was. To be avoided even for a simple drink
6,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Waited for almost an hour and the food wasn’t tasty at all. The Pasta was really dry and the pizza we had was terrible. The waitress was also unfriendly.
7,La Madonnina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible experience. Dirty table , flies everywhere, pizza was a glorified cheese toasty and the carbonara tasted just like milk and pasta. Couldn't even finish half of our meal because it tasted so bad"
8,La Madonnina, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Avoid at all cost.  A tourist trap, for certain.  Terrible service, unfriendly staff, poorly and stingingly prepared food, taking forever to serve it (and it was NOT busy at all) and to crown it all, most of our chairs were half broken. We …"
9,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Disappointing.
I was served with a dirty glass, the meal didn't match what I had ordered according to the menu, I was asked to pay for something I hadn't ordered and most …"
10,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good looking interior and clean. Menu is varied and not expensive, especially for the nice location at Rembrandt square. I had the vegetariana pizza and it was good. A bit quiet though on Sunday evening."
11,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Nice and tasty pizza. Very friendly service. I recommend this place .
12,La Madonnina, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Tourist trap! Great location but terrible food
The tomato soup tasted kind of like ketchup. They charge you for the type of pasta you chose (e.g charged us 0.80 for choosing penne)"
13,La Madonnina, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Really bad service and average pizza. One of my friends got her Food 30 minutes later than the rest and they forgot the side dish pasta of my other friend. Also when we got served, the waitress broke a plate in our table and didn't even …"
14,La Madonnina, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Worst experience ever. Our tortellini were good but Carppacio was disgusting. The woman Who looks like if she was The Boss, was very rude with everyone."
15,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good location, overlooking Rembrandtplein.
But the food itself was not good. The pizza was quite bland and tasteless. The servers were friendly enough, but inattentive, and it was difficult to get their attention."
16,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 months ago,Garlic bread with cheese is actually a pita with butter and basil. Horrible. Avoid at all costs.
17,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Bland food. Terrible service. Added a lot of salt and the pizza was okay.
18,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Looks great from inside and carbonara was perfect enough to enjoy our evening.
19,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Reasonably nice Italian restaurant. Fairly standard as Italian restaurants go. Nice place to eat in the evening due to heated outdoor area.
20,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,8 months ago,The stuff was really nice and kind. The food was good. The portion of lasagne was good but there was NO bechamel. The pizza was good as well and about the spaghetti carbonara - it had a little bit different taste than I’m used to from Italy but it was still good.
21,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent place for a bite to eat and a beer. You pay a bit of a premium for eating on the square, but it's by no means expensive. Nice outdoor dining area with a few under table heaters and blankets for when it's cold. Staff were attentive and friendly."
22,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The decent price could not make up for the poor service. Ordered garlic cheese bread which was no longer warm when brought to the table. The waiter seemed annoyed because we had questions about what we were ordering. The food, for 4 of us, …"
23,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited twice in our stay for dinner. Staff were very good, genuine in their welcome, helpful, engaging and made time for a chat, good sense of humour and excellent service. The pasta was very tasty - the best we have had outside of Italy. …"
24,La Madonnina, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very bad restaurant. The waiters were very service-minded and the food were really bad. I had a pizza and it tasted exactly like a frozen pizza that you just heat up in the oven for a couple of minutes. My friend had a pasta which also was …
25,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,8 months ago,Pizza is not too bad. Other than That our meals were not tasty. I don’t recommend
26,La Madonnina, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Staff was pretty unfriendly, dishes were bad. Cant recommend, just a trap for tourists"
27,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Absolutely shocking.
I understand that they were busy but still waiting for our order over one hour now. …"
28,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I do not recommend.
Bad service, rather rude, dirty cutlery. Half of the cutlery need to be changed because there were pieces of food from previous customers. …"
29,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We were only in Amsterdam for 2 nights, and we ate here both nights.  I love to sit under the large umbrellas, eating al-fresco, and this was just what the doctor ordered.  The food was good, as were the beer, the prices and the service. …"
30,La Madonnina, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice big terrace, good ice cream. Bottled beers were unfortunately not really cold."
31,La Madonnina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Too expensive for what they offer. We ordered Saltimbocca and they did not have salvia which is a staple ingredient.
Also the pasta were ordinary and the shrimp was so little because of the cooking …"
32,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ive given the 2 stars for the location which is a great area. I was starving when i came here and wanted pasta as i havnt had this in a while prices were between 8 to 12 euro's which i thought was very reasonable compared to the competition …
33,La Madonnina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, moderate value. Problem we had should be directed to most restaurants in central Amsterdam. Children's menu consists mainly of chicken nuggets. Why can't restaurants offer smaller versions of their meals? We want our kids to …"
34,La Madonnina, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Me and my sister have eaten here on two separate trips to Amsterdam. It's basic Italian food. Not fantastic, but nice. The first time we ate here was a very busy Friday night, and so the service wasn't totally perfect (we had to ask for the …"
35,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Got a really authentic Italian pizza that was inexpensive and delicious...staff was friendly and beer was good
36,La Madonnina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The pasta we ordered tasted very flat. No one checked on us after we got the food. They handed us the bill without any words, rather rude.
Won’t go there again."
37,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 years ago,"One word to this place: TERRIBLE! The Pizza was one of the worst Pizza's I've ever eaten! The service is very bad and unfriendly. One of the service personal spit a chewgum next to our place! We said him, he has to put the gum away, but he …"
38,La Madonnina, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Good ok. But they don’t give invoices with tax on it. Even if you ask.
39,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We ordered pasta frutti di mare and it was just tomato sauce with surimi. It didn't have any special taste and it was cold. The ""pesto"" pasta for a strange reason has milk and not so much pesto. The amount of pasta in the plate is exaggerate and the sauce is terrible. It doesn't worth it."
40,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Where to start... My mother is first generation italian and this is not italian food. Do not eat here!! The capresse salad came with cheap, fake mozzarella and old tomatos on a bed of what I assume was supposed to be the greens portion of …"
41,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Wish we had read reviews before visiting, rude staff that make you feel like you are a nuisance, bland food with no seasoning, slow service, and cheap flat cola in the place of coca cola but just as expensive. Not a good experience,  I …"
42,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I got the lasagna. I knew that the restaurant is not really Italian but I expected some decency. The taste was modest, but the dish was dirty in the exterior and a part of the food was burnt and stuck to the plate so I couldn't eat everything. Nobody from the staff asked me anything while eating or after."
43,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 years ago,"In summary: terrible food, terrible service, overpriced, incompetent staff.

Please read below for a more detailed explanation. …"
44,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Leaving a review to counter some of the negative ones on here. Just had lunch (pizza, pasta, a cheeseboard and a kid's chicken meal), the service was quick, the food was decent and reasonably priced. If you're a family looking for something quick and easy that isn't junk food, this place is fine."
45,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This restaurant was really bad and I don't recommend it.
The service was awful and after waiting for a long time we had to tell them to come even tho the restaurant wasn't full. …"
46,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 years ago,"It took an hour and a half for our food to arrive for non-complex orders. The cutlery was unclean and the staff blamed the industrial dishwasher being too hot for them. Servers were rude, and several soups had things in them I'd rather not find out what. Disgusting place, barely mediocre food, and absolutely terrible service."
47,La Madonnina, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Pizza Quatro formaggi"" - very good. Good taste of different cheeses. However waiter (lady) quie rude. Nice view."
48,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 years ago,This place sucks. Tourist trap XL... Overpriced and lying staff. They totally forgot about out starters AND our main dishes. When confronted they started lying about the reasons for the delay.... laughable... we ordered a simple pasta and a pizza... stay away from this place.... Really!
49,La Madonnina, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Unfriendly service, food is not homemade probably frozen food. Stay away from this tourist trap!"
50,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Prices reasonable, food disappointing. Sadly a lot of the prime locations seem to be trading on their position rather than the quality of the food.
Creamy spinach pasta made with partly dissolved stock cube, and over salty."
51,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Not bad. Veal was a bit dry. Pizza was large, more than enough for one person. Prices were ok for restaurant location."
52,La Madonnina, 1 star ,7 years ago,"It was horrible, it is just a fake place. Service is just slow and it's just like they don't care and they show now interest in you as customers.
They set your plates down on the table and without words they walk away. The …"
53,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I liked the food, I liked the staff despite all the negative reviews!"
54,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty food, generous plating and decent prices make up for an overall pleasant experience if you want to grab lunch or dinner. Keep in mind that during peak hours, serving might be a bit on the slow side."
55,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I agree with lots on here. Rude, incompetent staff that didn't listen or seem to care. Wrong wine, had to ask for pepper and parmesan. Waiter huffed when I asked for tap water and the pasta, which arrived suspiciously quickly, was …"
56,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Should've read the online reviews before going to this place. Worst pizza I've had, without exaggeration. Staff are slow and clueless. They forgot my simple order, and entree arrived after over 1 hour, upon second request!!! Shut this joint down!"
57,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Dirty place!!! Ordered onion soup but got a bowl of what looked and tasted like dish water.
Chose to leave after that, which was a good decision as when i looked in the …"
58,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The worst restaurant in Amsterdam, the Zuppa di peche soup was cooked with Surimi fish substitutes and smelled badly, the onion soup was just oil and cooked onion Calamari alla romana are cooked in disgusting curry sauce, Cozze al forno are …"
59,La Madonnina, 1 star ,8 years ago,"Simply HORRIBLE, this italian restaurant is just a bad pizzeria. I ate  pizza la Madonina and the special salad. First, the restaurant looks dirty, the products ware not fresh, the vejetables of the pizza weren´t cooking, the olive oil  did …"
60,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Some of the worst service ever had. Completely forgot about us with the restaurant empty, pretty rude service as well. Way over priced for mediocre food at best. The most ridiculous part of this was that as a starter they serve IMITATION CRAB MEAT instead of  SHRIMP."
61,La Madonnina, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Reasonable pizza and red house wine, not too expensive. Friendly staff."
62,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible!
Absolutely disgusting food. Complete waste of money,  left feeling sick and angry. Avoid by any means necessary, should of left as soon as i saw the colour changing fake candles."
63,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Despite of the good location, this is a place to avoid. The disappointment starts with the service, the beer taste really weird and the lasagna was more like a soup of cheese."
64,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 years ago,The food is terrible. The salad I ordered was dirty and not washed. The spaghetti pesto came with an ugly cheese sauce and was not fresh made. The table towel was not clean and service was very unprofessional. I wont eat here again!
65,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The pizzas we had were tasteless and obviously made from poor ingredients. The ""pasta frutti di mare"" that another person in our party had, appeared to be primarily spagetti and surimi."
66,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,We ordered food that never came but they tried to charge us for it. We got warm white wine - TWICE! The men's bathrooms had no functioning lock.
67,La Madonnina, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Do I really have to give it one star? This must be the worst ""Restaurant"" in Amsterdam. The food we ordered was killed by using most of the salt available to the chef. Bad food, bad service, bad seating (cramped and flavoured by the smells from the toilets)."
68,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Horrible food and terrible service. Visited it with my boyfriend. They did not seem to want to serve us at all, they were very rude and ignored us on several occasions. I would say almost to the point where it felt racist, because to other people of different nationalities they were very cordial and polite."
69,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Sat down before reading all the negative reviews. I was by myself so didn’t need much service. The Cannelloni I had was pretty good and worth the price of 9 Euros.
70,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had the margarita pizza and a couple of heinekens, it was fantastic."
71,La Madonnina, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Slow service, average food"
72,La Madonnina, 1 star ,2 years ago,Stayed 45 minutes for the food to arrive. Food tastes average. Would not recommend this place! So many better options all around.
73,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 years ago,"1h30 before they tell us that our order was lost between our table and the kitchen. Every time we asked them during the long wait they were like ""just 5 min more and it's ready"". So we just left."
74,La Madonnina, 1 star ,a year ago,"The taste of the food is of low quality, Heineken beer tastes like another beer, so Italian is just umbrellas. 🤔😒"
75,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"My girfriend got a bacterial infection after a visit here. A week of diarrhea, cramps, bad sleeping and eventually antibiotics. Furthermore the pizza's aren't that tasty."
76,La Madonnina, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very poor and disappointing food quality. It seems like the pizzas were thrown on the table directly from the fridge!
77,La Madonnina, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Poor quality ""italian"" food.  Not even close to italian food - yellow cheese on the dishes and salads no more than iceberg lettuce with italian names.  Go somewhere else on the square - anywhere else."
78,La Madonnina, 1 star ,8 years ago,"As of february 2014, the food is awful, the service is bad, and they won't give you tap water.  Make yourself a favor and buy your pre-cooked food at the supermarket, it will be the same."
79,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great staff and food, Rembrandt Square is always nice. I was in Amsterdam for about a month and only ate at a few places more than once and I was there at least four times."
80,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Really limit pizza was quite ok but pasta are just terrible, too much cooked without taste, do not come here.."
81,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Friendly / but not really Italian
82,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,Staff was rude and couldn’t speak English well. The food had no taste really. Wine was good though
83,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, loved the food."
84,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The food wasen't good, To mush salt.
We waited more than an hour.
Bad meal, bad time."
85,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,a year ago,Cold Pint for a good price!
86,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worthless place, should be closed down.
Rude, anti-social staff that have no sense of professionalism nor hospitality. Food is of industrial grade"
87,La Madonnina, 1 star ,a year ago,My girlfriend is italian so she knows what she is talking about: We can't recommend the Pizza at all.
88,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Veeeery long service time. Views are great, and pizza tasted good (maybe because of 1.5 hour waiting ?)."
89,La Madonnina, 1 star ,2 years ago,Not quality food. Prepared quickly. Only Heineken on tap. Nothing else.
90,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Awful food & bad service. Found myself wondering if someone could have spat in my food. No flavour to the food, avoid at all costs!!"
91,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice meal at a reasonable price. Staff is caring, but little overwhelmed sometimes (slow)."
92,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Pizza was not so worse like described in the reviews before, but the venue is not charming at all. Let's say it like that..."
93,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Not the best pasta you'll ever have (by a long way), but most definitely the very best home-made cream of tomato soup."
94,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We had two pizzas with really meagre toppings. Nothing special, just a tourist trap."
95,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I would rather not recommend this place. You'll get an somewhat okayish pizza but don't expect anything special.
96,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,Awful food! Do not be foolish from the prices and the staff! Do not recommended!
97,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Food is blant and not fresh. The exterior and interior is dirty. Prices are okay.
98,La Madonnina, 1 star ,3 years ago,Well you can buy better lasagne in any store in freezers. Avoid by any chance.
99,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Reasonably priced, staff a bit inattentive but other than that a fairly standard, no frills restaurant"
100,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Not horrible, slow service, food is okay - but it's not great and not even close to being fresh."
101,La Madonnina, 1 star ,5 months ago,Extremely bad service.... 🤢
102,La Madonnina, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Food only average. Prices partially inadequate.

109,La Madonnina, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Decent food and service at a reasonable price considering the location.
110,La Madonnina, 1 star ,4 years ago,Incompetent waiters and absolutely disgusting and messy restaurant. Should be avoided by all means.
111,La Madonnina, 5 stars ,a year ago,It is awesome. The people are great and also the food.
