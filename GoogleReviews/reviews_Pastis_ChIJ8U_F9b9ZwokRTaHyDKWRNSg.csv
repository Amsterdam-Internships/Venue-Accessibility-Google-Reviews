2,Pastis, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Pastis’s burger is one of the best. It was cooked perfectly. It tasted juicy and delicious and it was certainly filling. My group also split the pancakes, which were fluffy and sprinkled with just the right amount of sugar. …"

9,Pastis, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"My recommendation: go with someone who is willing to share. The best combo on the menu is the burger and the steak sandwich. To be honest, cannot think of a more deadly combination. Add in a couple dirty martinis and you have yourself a night out!"
10,Pastis, 3 stars ,a month ago,"I wanted to come here for quite a while. I had a reservation for a Tuesday night, hoping that we'd avoid the crowds. Nope. This place was crowded and loud. The place is beautiful, but there's nothing in the decor to attenuate the noise. On …"
11,Pastis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very expensive.. But also very good. Tried escargot and the patê for appetizer. Both really good. For main dish, my father had the steak tartare, I had the lamb, and my brother had a sandwich. I tried theirs and were really tasty. Mine was …"

20,Pastis, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I always have an amazing time here. Delicious food and drinks, gorgeous spot. Top notch service. The burger is NO JOKE and deserves to be top rated. Everything is good. Good oyster spot. One of my favorite restaurants in the city for sure."
21,Pastis, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Classic . The same owners of Baltazar in Soho. Same ambience. Kind of noisy. Some fish meat and pasta. Limited menu.The service was good. I had the chicken paillard with almonds and salad. It was very delicious.

24,Pastis, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"I LOVE the food here, they never disappoint. However the staff is not trained the same as it once was. We asked for a specific table outside and were told to our face that it was reserved.   A short while later, another table was switched …"
25,Pastis, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"I was unimpressed but wouldn't have left a review except for the canned sardines.  Really, they served a can.  With sardines. I won't say the price. Let's say the bill was high for me.  On the other hand, the duck was exceptional, so I have to feel mixed about the experience.  I wouldn't go back."
26,Pastis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Really good food! Service was friendly and helpful but def a little slow (it’s a big place). The burger and mussels were lovely so tasty. Raspberry dessert SO GOOD

32,Pastis, 5 stars ,a month ago,The couple that runs the bar is my favorite since cheers. Great Parisian atmosphere with rich choice in menu. We were completely satisfied with starters and one side. Can't imagine people finishing starters and entree that's how large the portions are .
33,Pastis, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Great cocktails, great ambience, great servers. Their outside area is nice but it’s packed. I honestly preferred the inside :). The interior designing is magnificent and the music they play matches. Love how fresh and tasty their food was. …"
34,Pastis, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Excellent across the board. It’s so nice to have a restaurant know how to deliver quality customer service and excellent food at the same time.
I just wish this concept carried across the continental divide to Colorado…"
35,Pastis, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"This is a great restaurant!! I chose to eat here for my birthday last night. My Mom and I ordered the grilled branzino with beans and tapenade.

43,Pastis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Food was delicious and the service was great. I suggests you also try the Mac & Cheese. Unfortunately we devoured it before I could snap a picture.
44,Pastis, 5 stars ,11 months ago,This review is months late but needs to be posted because their food is INCREDIBLE. The French Onion Soup will probably be the best you’ve ever had. I took a 45min trip back just to have their Steak Sandwich again - so that’s really all …

46,Pastis, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Delicious steak, excellent customer service! Even the guest are really cool. My friends and I hated the crème brûlée, it was disgusting but we made jokes out of it."
47,Pastis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Came out at noon, early enough to do a walk-in. Waiters were really awesome and helpful. Social distancing is great, giving people their space. In a great location as well. The hot chocolate is very delicious. The steak tartare is also …"
48,Pastis, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"My wife had told me about this place once upon a time, but it was closed for years. This last trip to NYC I happened to cross it and sent her picture asking if it was the same place. She lost her mind. We were in NY for a week and went down …"
49,Pastis, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"I had the Cheeseburger a l'Americaine. It comes with fries. It's like a really really good fast food burger. 2 med sized patties, cheese, and a nice bun. I ommited the lettuce, onion, pickles and got the sauce on the side."

Have one.
The salade niçoise was freshly prepared 👌 dressing to salad ratio. The tuna was …"
57,Pastis, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Everything was super salty from fries, French onion soup to mussels. I’ve never eaten any food made this salty in my life. It was filled with tourists(felt bad for them)and I’ve had much better french food from other “less known” restaurants in the city. Would not recommend."
58,Pastis, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"One of those restaurant-group owned restaurant that’s worth returning. Returned here for the first time since late 2019

65,Pastis, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I had lunch during the pandemic, outside. Safety measures were appropriate, such as contact-less menu and check, ample space between tables, capacity limit in restrooms, masks... all of which made me feel very comfortable. I ordered a pilsner and the house  cheeseburger; they were good. Service was very attentive."
66,Pastis, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I went here on my birthday this past Saturday. I ordered a steak frites, wanting my steak well done. The first time around, my steak came out pink and rare (honest mistake, I get it.) The second time around, half of my steak was well done, …"
67,Pastis, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,pricey place but very good food! difficult to find a chef who will actually cook meat blue / rare here but this place did not disappoint
68,Pastis, 4 stars ,7 months ago,I have eaten here in the past. If the weather is good definitely eat outside if you do not like very noisy environments. The food is very good quality. However the service is a little slow but worth the wait! If you do not mind a noisy energetic atmosphere then sitting inside would be the option for you.
69,Pastis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Truly missed this place. Did not miss how loud it is. Excellent service & food. Ambience & decor is a step above its previous location.  The is a bit overwhelming but it is Pastis after all. Glad to have them back.

73,Pastis, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Honestly I haven’t had a place, or a meal that had genuinely impressed me or made me happy in a long time. The vibe is great and the food was terrific.

80,Pastis, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Have always been a great fan of Pastis. My recent dinner experience was, however, a disaster. Opted for ""fish of the day"", a medium size grilled perch. First of all there was hardly anything to eat (26€), and secondly the tiny piece of fish …"

101,Pastis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very busy and trendy place. French (brunch) menu with excellently prepared dishes. Great place to combine with a visit to the Whitney museum. Best to make a reservation in the weekends

112,Pastis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great vibe and delicious food. The herrings were incredible - a tour-de-force when you think that it's basically pickled fish with potatoes. I don't know what they add in their baked eggs with asparagus but I finished it all. I loved the …

119,Pastis, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"We came here for dinner, love the vibe, super nice staff and the food. We order the oysters and the hanger steak both really good.

149,Pastis, 4 stars ,a year ago,It was empty around early dinner time. Daughter had a cocktail with almond tones. She loved it. Hamburger was good but onion soup was outstanding. Seven year old grandson had the hangar steak which he devoured. …
150,Pastis, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Dessert and coffee very good. Service good .not sure if they give refills but at $5 cup they should. The server had to look for raw sugar cubes and found them . White sugar is so last decade.

154,Pastis, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The atmosphere is great , the waiter is nice, however my BF has ordered beef bourguignon and he didn’t like it at all because it was with bacon (nothing mention that it was with bacon) and he has an allergy so now he is not okay ! I hope that you put next time all the details so that we can go back happy about our experience !"
155,Pastis, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Very good brasserie. Pate was special, steak tartare almost as special but good. Service was efficient for a busy Tuesday night. Lively, interesting cross section of humanity."

157,Pastis, 4 stars ,9 months ago,The food is good. We sat outside and the ambience was poor. Some plants or flowers would help and some better furniture. If you pay 200 bucks for dinner you should be able to expect a more pleasant environment

165,Pastis, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Very yummi food most go again
166,Pastis, 4 stars ,a year ago,Have always loved Pastis our fave is the chicken paillard salad. The onion soup is very good but pretty salty this time and the artichoke hearts were a new try for us and were good but the olive tapenade was slightly strong. Probably being a bit picky like I said we always enjoy it here and the service is great!
167,Pastis, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious.  They have a great outdoor dining setup with heaters.  Had brunch in 28° weather and still enjoyed it. Great selection of hot cocktails for the winter weather.

184,Pastis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Missed Pastis. Such an iconic place. Food, atmosphere, everything was good."
185,Pastis, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We ordered take out, perhaps that’s why our fries were cold and tasted as if they were reheated? The burger and steak sandwich were good. Perhaps the dine-in experience might be more pleasant ."
186,Pastis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved it then love it now. Had a wonderful brunch today. Everyone loved their dish.

238,Pastis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Took me back to the good old days of NYC when French bistro concepts were all the rage. It's like they never left. Great food, near chaotic energy, a certain level of snark. It brought back a piece of New York I thought died out. Loved every moment of it."

280,Pastis, 4 stars ,9 years ago,The best eatery in the Meatpacking District since our beloved Florent was unceremoniously shuttered. Great for brunch or a late night snack. Hate waiting? Not a regular? Then consider yourself warned. You may be in line for a table during peak hours.
