0,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Located in the red light district, but you wouldn't think it. It's hidden in a private garden that isolates you from the bustle of the streets. …"
1,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great restaurant tucked away on a side alley just outside of the red light district. Good atmosphere, great service, we did the set menu, and everything we had was absolutely delicious. Would highly recommend!"
2,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice restaurant with a nice high class surprise 3-5 course menu and good wines alongside. You'll end up at around 100€ per person including drinks and tip. I think it's worth it.
3,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious contemporary cuisine and nice staff.
Good wine and jazz.
You must go
:-)"
4,Blauw aan de Wal, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Excuisite, well combined dishes and very friendly unpretentious service. Personally, I didn't like the dark, sort of stylish but not so stylish atmosphere. But the place is a hidden gem, in a quiet backyard, right in the middle of the redlight district."
5,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,An quiet oasis in a middle of Red Light district. Not cheap but in our opinion was worth the money. Nice friendly service. Every course was delicious and beautifully presented. Would visit again.
6,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Phenomenal dining experience! Everything I ordered was beautifully presented, perfectly executed, and absolutely delicious. The only thing better than the fantastic food was the phenomenal service. Like the other waiters there, the waiter …"
7,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely brilliant and utterly amazing cuisine experience.
8,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic gem hidden down a alley. Half way down the alley the sign appears, once inside its very cozy and comfortable. …"
9,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Located in the Red Light district but as it's hidden in a private garden, it seems you are miles from the busy streets. A tasty five-course meal was more than enough, with delicious wine, white and red, suggested by the waiter. I dined …"
10,Blauw aan de Wal, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Visited here with four friends on a recent trip to Amsterdam, and we had a four course dinner for €52 each. Each of the courses was good whilst not spectacular as one might expect for the price; the main course of cod was particularly …"
11,Blauw aan de Wal, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"This place used to be my go to whenever I stopped in Amsterdam.

The food was great, the wine selection succulent and the service courteous. …"
12,Blauw aan de Wal, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The atmosphere is old fashion, specially upstairs. Make sure you seat downstairs: the decoration is much more interesting and cozy with some brick walls and wood details (upstairs seems like a claustrophobic hotel from the 90s’, with white …"
13,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Had a lovely evening dining alone here. Service was friendly and informal, the food was exquisite, but be prepared for long waiting times between courses -- at least it allows you to digest in between a bit. This is a full evening's event …"
14,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Visiting Blauw aan de Wal was a real delight. The food was utterly delicious and every course a surprise and a treat. The service was excellent - friendly and knowledgeable, great advice on wines. Can't recommend highly enough!"
15,Blauw aan de Wal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really good restaurant. You have to chose the number of courses you are going to take. I took 5 and it was OK. Quite a lot overall but I am not a big eater and I managed. There are some times between each courses (15 - 25mn) and that helps. …
16,Blauw aan de Wal, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice setting downstairs. Upstairs felt like an afterthought. Service was okay. Food was okay. Food took too long, we cancelled dessert as we'd already been there far too long. Felt rushed and awkward. Too costly. Not great for Valentine's Day dinner."
17,Blauw aan de Wal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Somehow this is labeled as Mediterranean cuisine.  It is that in the sense that France and Italy have access to the sea shoreline.  It is a 4-6 course dinner with  French/Italian influence.  Very few seats; cozy atmosphere, very attentive staff."
18,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant is down a little alley off one of the main red light streets. Don't let that put you off. Culinary delight awaits. An old Spice warehouse has been converted to a provider of simply delicious food and wine, in simple but …"
19,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"This really is a nice place to go to for a special occasion. The food is very well prepared and the quality is excellent. Their wine selection is also a perfect match and the service is not in the way, but they are very knowledgeable and …"
20,Blauw aan de Wal, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Service and food are amazing but the noise of the coffee machine, bar, sink area in the middle of the ground floor dining area is absolutely awful! Makes you want to rush through your meal to have some peace and quiet."
21,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Extraordinarily talented creative chef.  Superb and friendly service.   Secreted down a tiny alleyway off the main drag of the red light district...this tiny (need a reservation!) resto delivers amazing sui generus culinary surprises: …
22,Blauw aan de Wal, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A fixed price menu with 3, 4 & 5 course options.  Intimate space. Good quality food. Sit back and be surprised by the inventive dishes that are brought."
23,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A gem hidden amongst the red light district. Possibly a little formal as a setting, easily forgiven considering the quality of food and on this occasion we were hosted by very friendly staff. Give it a try."
24,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic food, matched wine and service.  Very tricky to find, down a little alley,,but with the hunt.  You’ll end up in an oasis in a crazy part of the city."
25,Blauw aan de Wal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely unexpected relaxing spot in the middle of De Wallen (also known as Red Lights). Fantastic food, quiet and charming. The prices are pleasant too."
