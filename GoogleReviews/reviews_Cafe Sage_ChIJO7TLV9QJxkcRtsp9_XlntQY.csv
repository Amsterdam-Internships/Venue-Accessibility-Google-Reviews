There were signs everywhere saying to order inside, but inside they refused and said we must order outside. The outdoor seating area is very nice."

2,Cafe Sage, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Hip but relaxed place. Nice interior. Great choice for breakfast if you have time to spend I recommend to pick more dishes to share. Food is delicious but portions can be smaller than you would expect from the price tag.
