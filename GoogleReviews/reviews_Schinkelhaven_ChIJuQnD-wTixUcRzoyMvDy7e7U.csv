0,Schinkelhaven, 1 star ,4 months ago,"I was really disappointed by this experience. Burger bread was too hard, the fries chopped like onions and the salad (?).... . This is exactly how to ruin a burger."
1,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Nice cafe with decent food, the burger was really good. Plenty of beers on tap."
2,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice place, nice food and good beer."
3,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice terras, with heating and friendly staff. Good food for a reasanobel price. Next to the Vondelpark. Sate with fries and salade for 16,50."
4,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Nice neighborhood bar with surprisingly wonderful apple pie.
5,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place! Excellent price quality. Great atmosphere! Good to go with friends or fun dates (weekends could be kind of loud)
They also have a cool outside area!"
6,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice bar for both, drinks and snacks. A good choice for either sunny or rainy days as it has indoors and outdoors sitting. Good selection beers and right by Vondelpark. For more experiences follow @quiquinnv"
7,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really great service, and food selection. The nachos are to die for especially because they had almost no salt."
8,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice relaxed cafe at a great location. Friendly staff, though I'd avoid the evening hours in the weekend as it is just too busy. Unless of course you make sure you're first and start your session early ;)"
9,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Very good food, steak was tiny though. A little on the expensive side, otherwise recommended."
10,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great local cafe / bar to chill in after New Year's walk though Vondelpark.
11,Schinkelhaven, 2 stars ,a year ago,Staff is friendly and beer selection OK (on par with most cafes in the city). Don't go there for food and don't ask for the Amsterdamnse plankje. It's gross. There are options within less than 100m that are far superior to what this cafe can offer.
12,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice place. We are coming quite frequently with my partner, just to have couple of drinks and have an hour for ourselves, without kids. Great location, good drinks, good terrace, very good service. Not too noisy. Recommend üëçüòä"
13,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food and beers. I enjoyed my past visits, but the last one when we came in a bigger group the waitress was stressed and forgot our orders. I wouldn't give more than 2 stars for that time but on average from all my visits it deserves a ‚Ä¶"
14,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Exactly what you expect: beers and simple but good food.
Nothing more nothing less."
15,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place close to the Vondelpark (oppositie entrance of Leideplein). Can be crowded on nice spring and summer days and a nice place during warm evenings.
16,Schinkelhaven, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The bar terrace is nice for enjoying a beer on those odd days the sun actually shines in the Netherlands.  The choice of beers on tap and in bottle is pretty decent. But their menu choices are limited and food quality is a real let down. My ‚Ä¶
17,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I like this place. Staff is always in a good mood and it's just at the exit of vonderpark. Tried bitterballen there and there were quite good. There are a lot of seats on the terrace which is a definite plus. They usually have like 5 different beers on tap and a good mix of IPA, lager, pills"
18,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went here for a quick lunch after we had a meeting nearby. It was acceptable, but don't expect anything fancy. When we where there the coffee machine wasn't working. They do have a nice terrace and are close to the vondelpark"
19,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious burgers, extremely friendly and attentive waiters, great beer selection right outside vondelpark with a nice terrace. Perfect! ‚Ä¶"
20,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A very causy and stylish pub. The Local Dutch people said that it was a typical Dutch pub! We went there for my sister's birthday. After about 11.00 you can also dance around the bar! Besides outside tables are very good option  too.
21,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Awesome terrace seating right next to Vondelpark. Fresh, creative salads and delicious burgers and fries, affordable drinks, and seemed to be a popular place for young locals. Our service was very friendly, too. Loved it!"

23,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Schinkelhaven is a great place to eat and have drinks with your friends. They have a great variety of Craftbeers and their dishes match great with the beers that they are serving. The staff is very passionate about the flavours as well and ‚Ä¶
24,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"De Schinkelhaven burger is absolutely delicious! Service was a little slow and unpersonal but in his defence, it was quite busy and just 1 waiter"
25,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A really cool place in the high-end district of Aud Zuid. There are many eating places in the area, but this one has a great ambience and interesting people. The food is great. Try the special burger."
26,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We crashed here on a particularly cold winter afternoon for a hot cup of chocolate milk and were glad we did. Quiet and cosy, great place to catch up with a friend over a cup of coffee. There were some colouring books and pens for the kids. Good location on the edge of the Vondelpark."
27,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place to hang out and drink with friends.
28,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We go there very frequently. In a very good location and they serve good food and good drinks. Staff is very friendly too. And the place is fairly priced. Perfect spot for a quick snack or a quick drink.
29,Schinkelhaven, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Way too expensive, not worthy. A plate is 15‚Ç¨! I ordered the chicken with peanut sauce and I didn't like it. It was like eating directly from a peanut butter jar and the salad was imposible to eat, I don't know what it had but was extremely bitter."
30,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Having a drink and take in the atmosphere of Amsterdam, cafe Schinkelhaven is the place to go. Nice outdoor patios that are filled in the summer. The indoor part of the cafe is typical Dutch cafe decor, it's functional and serves the purpose. Lots of beer options, don't miss this place, it's so easy to just flee in to vondelpark."
31,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had a great tuna melt and excellent ginger beer. Also very nice and friendly customer service. Would go there again!

34,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service and quality of the food.  Uitsmijters and toasties  are great, but you can order a bunch of things. The sphere is superb and food is really fresh  üòä. Really worth it."
35,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty food, friendly staff, a kids option, high chair and change table, yet not overrun with kids. Good selection of beers. Veggie burger was great."

40,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Quite possibly the best burger this side of the hemisphere. Service is great, friendly and the ambiance is very ""gezellig"". Go ahead, you know you want to try it now."
41,Schinkelhaven, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Another great experience, really great service and cozy environment!"
42,Schinkelhaven, 1 star ,3 years ago,"So, I get a horrible tasting salat ü•ó (13,50‚Ç¨) that bad that I actually send it back and ask for fries instead -and they say you have to pay for the salat anyway - (which they took awayüòÇ) but (yeah me!)

45,Schinkelhaven, 4 stars ,a year ago,Dutch normal bar next to the park . Nice easy street terrace.  God to have an occasional drink ..
46,Schinkelhaven, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"16,5‚Ç¨ for a regular hamburger? Too expensive for me, maybe is just the ""Amsterdam way"". Beer was fair, though also expensive (5‚Ç¨). I would not pay that price for a regualr, nothing-special-dinner."

55,Schinkelhaven, 1 star ,3 years ago,Overpriced like hell! A rochefort 8 that you can buy in the supermarket for 1.90 euro costs there 6.75. Really? Even in the supermarket they make profit but how much profit do you need? Pfff never again!
