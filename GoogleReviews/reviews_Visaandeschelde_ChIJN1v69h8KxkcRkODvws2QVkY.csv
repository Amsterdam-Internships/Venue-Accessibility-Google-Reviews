13,Visaandeschelde, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice location, nice waitresses, good amuses, good fresh oysters, but very unfortunately the rest was not good. The bouillabaisse should be called a bisque with salmon  and shellfish, main dish was monkfish: a concrete with bad mushroom saus ‚Ä¶"

25,Visaandeschelde, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We opted for the tasting menu  with wine pairing and were not disappointed. No bread service. Service was inconsistent - some were efficient and some could not care less - could be that it was late for them (we came at 9:30). But if you crave for good seafood, this is worth a visit."

33,Visaandeschelde, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Extraordinary good restaurant. If you want to be treated like a King or Queen you should go to Vis aan de Schelde.

42,Visaandeschelde, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"Went on Valentine's day and had the 4-course set menu. The main course was a bit boring, but the rest of the meal was good. The courses were far appart so spent 3 hours in the restaurant which in my opinion is too long."
