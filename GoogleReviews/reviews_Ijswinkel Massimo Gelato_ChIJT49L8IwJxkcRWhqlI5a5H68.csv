0,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Five freaking stars, absolutely no hesitation. The pistachio flavor is just the best thing that has happened to mankind. The service is lovely as well, definitely a must try in Amsterdam!! The other flavors, tiramisu and gorgonzola with mascarpone and figs are also really good."
1,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Massimo's has the best gelato and sorbet. I have tried the hazelnut gelato and sorbet, the figs and ricotta, gorgonzola and figs, and tiramisu. All have been amazing. The only flavour I didn't love was the chocolate caramel and salt. I found it to be a bit too much."
2,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Excellent ice-creams.
Being a regular customer, I just wished the flavours would change a bit more and why not trying out some new flavours with more daring ingredients? (for example: olive oil, basil, rosemary‚Ä¶)"
3,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing tiramisu ice cream! Also recommend the milk chocolate which is pretty dark and the berries! Great choice for vegan and non vegan ice cream üç¶
4,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very good ice cream. Each flavor has a unique texture, for example small hazelnut pieces in hazelnut icecream etc. Chocolate salty caramel and tiramisu probably my favourites so far. Service friendly and prices ok for amsterdam. Depending on time of day there may be a queue, at most i had to wait 10 min so far but often it‚Äôs quick."
5,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Ever wondered why people stand in line for this ice-cream parlor? There are an amazing selection of hand-made ice-creams, with unique flavours like real fig-based and ricotta icecreams. Flavours you don't see at your standard parlor. I paid ‚Ä¶"
6,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"What a nice place with fantastic ice cream and really strong espresso, as it should be. The ice cream there has a taste and consistent I never had before - first class. We highly recommend to visit this place as it has the perfect ice cream üëç Wish you would be near Heidelberg in Germany üòÄ"
7,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Typical delicious Italian gelato flavor, but I ordered a sorbet pistachio, but the staff gave it the wrong gelato pistachio...:("
8,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"One of the best places to grab some gelato in Amsterdam. Fresh and Delicious... the tiramisu flavour was epic to say the least. The texture was also perfect. Given the wide assortment of flavours, clearly gotta go here more often. ‚Ä¶"
9,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"By far the best ice cream in the Netherlands. Can be easily compared to some of the best ice cream in Italy. The vegan options are really good, a game changer if you are lactose intolerant. ‚Ä¶"
10,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Very tasty Italian gelato ice cream is available there. These icecream are made in the same place. They are really good. Especially the pistachio is very very nice. You can take away too. The container keeps ice for 40-50 minutes. Must taste icecream atleast once from this place.
11,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Update 20210807

Recommended: Pistachio, ricotta&figs, all sorbets. ‚Ä¶"
12,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great ice cream! The best pistachio I've ever had, but we tasted some more and they were all great too (dark chocolate, caramel & salt, riccota & rigs...). Not expensive at all considering how good they are!!"
13,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious ice cream but terrible customer service. Unfortunately the young lady who served me with curly brown hair and glasses couldn‚Äôt remember how to say please, hello, Thankyou or even ask me what I would like. I must say the ice cream itself was nice, but for that price tag there are many better options with basic customer service"
14,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Really nice ice cream, I missed only the smell of freshly baked cones. Lots of gelato varieties, ice cream and sorbet. There are queues sometimes but it's worth the wait."
15,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,10 months ago,"First time we went, it was 5 stars.
But last time one I choose was just so-so..
Still best Gelato shop in Amsterdam."
16,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,When You are visiting the aerea ‚ÄúTHE PIJP‚Äù then this is the place to be for a good coffee! They have oatmilk and other milk choices. You must try all the dolcis which are amazing ! Initially they are famous for their good icecream but they ‚Ä¶
17,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Loved the pistacchio sorbet!
A trip to Italy in a bite (in a lick actually)."
18,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very good quality ice-cream. Good ingrediants. I tried pistachio and hazelnut. Both are really good. I will definitely go back to try more flavours. üëçüëçüëç
19,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The most delicious gelato in the city. Nice variety of tastes. The pistachio and dark chocolate are the best!
20,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,5 months ago,These flavours bring you back to all those sweet memories from childhood after mom picked you up from school and brought you to that lovely traditional ice cream shop in your home little town. Google should create a 6th star for places like this!!
21,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Decent ice cream but to queue so long for it... would be just a regular place in Italy and 3 times cheaper. Quite overrated. ‚Ä¶
22,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you love gelato, you must go here. This is the  real deal. I had the pistachio and ricotta with caramelized figs. So good! There was a line but it moved quickly. Very friendly and helpful staff.  If you can't decide, ask for a taste."
23,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I can't say enough about Massimo Gelato. In my 6 nights in Amsterdam we visited 3 times. Highly recommend the pistachio! Enjoyed a latte with our gelato which was also very good. Stop in, have a sample of a flavor if you're unsure, and enjoy a scoop or two of this wonderful gelato!"
24,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Definitely the best (and most authentic) gelato in Amsterdam.  I joined my husband on a business trip to the Netherlands for the sole purpose to do some research on gelaterias in countries other than Italy.  I was so incredibly impressed by ‚Ä¶
25,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,Love their vegan ice cream! I had the vegan pistachio and hazelnut gelato. Can‚Äôt believe it was vegan! Will definitely return for their other flavors :)
26,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Best ice cream store in De Pijp area.
You have plenty of flavors, my favorite is Fig and Ricotta."
27,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love, love & love üíó I love the small portions and the option to get variety of flavors. For ice cream lovers, you can now have 2-3 flavors in small portions without the guilt or breaking the bank. Tried the pistachio and chocolate today ‚Ä¶"
28,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,4 months ago,The gelato store is lovely decorated. You might like it if you prefer really really sweet ice cream.
29,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good ice-cream but too little. I tryed the chocolate with pink salt and caramel (a very good one) and the coconut in which you can taste some grated coconut, not only the flavor. They have a lot of different types, so you will find the ‚Ä¶"
30,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Absolutely excellent gelato, pistachio was so rich and natural, full of roasted pistachios. Definitely recommended! Only downside is that they don‚Äôt serve corns, cups only which was a little bit disappointing, but still amazing ice cream!"
31,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food, Quality, Price:
Lots of flavours to choose from and honestly I could've eaten everything! In the end I opted for pistachio, tiramisu, and ricotta & fig. Man, everything was so ‚Ä¶"
32,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Second time in this place and again super tasty ice cream. I recommend to try  pistachio flavor. Unfortunately they don't offer cookie cones, only disposable cups. But they do ask if you want a small cookie with your order."
33,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"U can always see a long queue in front of this little store that serves the best gelato in town! Their pistachio, almond, and chessecake flavours are the best!"
34,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We walked 40 minutes to find this place as I was told they had the best vegan gelato in town. Let me tell you that ain't no lie. This place is absolutely amazing, they had so many flavors.  I tried the peach and pistachio,  the peach is to die for. I cant wait to return!!!"
35,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"this is what we deserve, impeccable quality ice cream. we‚Äôre loving the vegan gelato options."
36,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best ice cream in the buurt and top in Amsterdam. Don't miss it if you are near! (be ready for a queue if the day is sunny)
37,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Ice cream are delicious however it has changed so much since the beginning. Very small portions and staff almost rude. It was one of my fav things to do in Amsterdam but it is certainly not any longer. Too bad.
38,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Nice Taste but dont accept cash, Sorry!

Edit: There are everywhere Shops who have much more Money in their Cashtrays and still Work with Cash! Aslong you dont accept Cash i will not enter you Buisness!"
39,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Their ice creams are just as good if not even better than the few great gelateria I have selected and tried in Italy. Very creamy, flavourful, a real food orgasm. 4.5‚Ç¨ for 3 scoops is very reasonable."
40,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very tasty icecream . I took sorbetto passion fruit and It was delicious. My wife took icecream with pistache and almond and she loved it
41,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The dark chocolate and hazelnut sorbetti are absolutely delicious! So worth the wait, I'll come back for sure! More vegan flavors to come? :)"
42,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 2 stars ,10 months ago,"The ice creams are actually very good quality, probably among the best in town ! But it just too expensive. The ratio price/quality/quantity is just not reasonable. In addition,  the price for the 10L pack used to be the same whether you ‚Ä¶"
43,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"They make their icecream at place so you always have a nice, dellicious , fresh icecream when you order it. I tried many flavor of icecream there and almost all of them were as good as others and in my opinion best icecream I had in ‚Ä¶"
44,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Ice cream was tasty and not expensive
45,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Favourite regular ice cream spot! And with 4/5 vegan options as well as sorbets.
46,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I have tried many Gelatos around the globe and confidently i can say this one has best taste and quality ever . It is a must whenever i visit Amsterdam
47,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I tried ice cream of Massimo Gelato upon advice of an Italian friend from Rome. I had dark chocolate and forest fruits. Taste is pleasantly strong. I will come back to try other flavors üç®
48,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best ice cream in Amsterdam.
49,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Seller ask to pay in advance before showing how big is one medium portion. Due to I bought 4 medium(2 for kids) it was too much but its already paid :( So I didn't have chance to estimate the size before buy it. Finally taste is smth average I would say, total dissapointment, sorry for that."
50,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Delicious ice cream, very creamy, lovely texture and various not so mainstream, it's a must try! I don't give 5 starts because they dont have waffle cones and because I don't think their cups where they scoop the ice-cream is too sustainable or eco-friendly"
51,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,One of the best ice cream shop in Amsterdam. Really. I mean it.
52,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious vegan ice cream. They have pistachio, dark chocolate and hazelnut, all amazing!"
53,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I'm an icecream lover and I can tell you these guys came up with one of the best icecreams I have ever tried. The queue doesn't lie. Btw don't worry about it cause it only gonna take 5 minutes. Get to visit this jewel of amsterdam with good ‚Ä¶
54,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Just perfect ! Very good price, very good product,
Nice people at the desk : you HAVE TO go !!!!!!"
55,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Easily the best ice cream in the Netherlands. Potentially some of the best ice cream in Europe, even. It's just so good."
56,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best gelato in Amsterdam. Every flavour is incredible. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place!
57,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"This is one of the best gelatos I've had in my life. We had the pistachio - hazelnut, which was the best by far with a great flavor and texture. We also had creme - tiramisu, was also good but the other one was just incredible."
58,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Just the best ice cream. Even better than the one found in italy.. Vegan option. Try the pistacio as well just a unique experience.. Just GO!!
59,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"The BEST ICE CREAM in the city.
(I probably shouldn't say that publicly because I like being able to go without having to queue, but oh well) ‚Ä¶"
60,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Ice cream is nice but there is a waiting time of 20 minutes. Having 1 guy to serve ice-cream is way too low and creates huge queues.
61,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,7 months ago,I loveeee massimo and I go there many times a week. However today Friday around 7PM It was such a disappointment. The cashier was sooooo rude. She was bothered we were there. The other 2 girls didnt seem to be in a mood to work either. They ‚Ä¶
62,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best Panettone ever! We bought a Chocolate version specially for the kids, following a recommendation from a cafe manager - never tried anything more delicious! It‚Äôs homemade in Italy, also beautifully wrapped, thus could be a nice gift if you are visiting friends or a family."
63,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best Italian gelato in Amsterdam, I come here every week since the opening and Massimo always surprises me with his special new flavours ‚ù£Ô∏èüç¶"
64,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Overall nice and ok experience if slow. On flavour for me it was too clean and natural, I prefer a sweeter gelato."
65,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"This is literally the best gelato in Amsterdam, I have tried several places in the city and none of them are close to this quality. Perks to the pistachio flavour, it is awesome."
66,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Visited twice. Amazing ice cream, really the best!! Very unfriendly staff :("
67,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Gelato in Amsterdam so far. Pistachio is an excelent choice...go for it! Gelato is made there, in front of you, everything is fresh."
68,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is the absolute coffee and ice cream heaven. Just like in the best places in Italy, and then better! Wow, we are blessed to have a place like this in Amsterdam!"
69,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 2 stars ,a year ago,"First of all, I must say that the ice-creams are delicious, this is THE place in Amsterdam if you want a good gelato. BUT, as a regular customer I also have to give the following feedback: I have been there recently and the last 2 times ‚Ä¶"
70,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"When you thought you've had good ice cream,you haven't been to this small establishment who makes their own ice cream right there.
The line speaks fir itself üòä
Don't miss it for the world!"
71,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Definitely The BEST Gelato in the town! It also got approved by all of my italian friends so it means that's its √† place to beüòâ
72,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"After trying multiple places in Amsterdam over the past few years, Massimo always stands out as the best ice cream in the city that I could find. The ice cream is always delicious, and the staff is very friendly, and it has become my go to place for ice cream for a while now."
73,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best place to get gelato in Amsterdam. It is a bit pricey (don't expect italian prices), but it is worth it.
They have nice flavours of the month; so far I've seen Pineapple, Figs, ‚Ä¶"
74,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Tasty custom made ice cream. It can be crowded and you'll need to wait in a queue. My perconal advice is trying chocolate with salty caramel. It's delicious
75,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best in Amsterdam. I just find dark chocolate a bit on the sweet side, would be lovely to taste the bitterness of cacao a little more. But overall friendly staff, high quality ice cream. Worth waiting in looong lines on warm days."
76,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Was okay. Nothing too great. Also they only have cups, not cones. A bit sad. Waffle cones are more sustainable than paper cup."
77,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Incredible ice cream! Real Italian, all flavors are amazing. Dark chocolate sorbetto is my favorite. Only place to go for ice cream in Amsterdam!"
78,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good ice cream, some flavors are a complete miss (e.g. peach or salty caramel)."
79,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I love Italian üç® and that's what you will find here, if you don't mind the queue, only a testimony for how good it is. I love the vanilla and pistachio combination."
80,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place has one of the best ice creams I have ever tried! My friends recommended this place and I visited it twice when in Amsterdam. Make sure you try their pistachio ice cream - it‚Äôs sooo good! ü§©
81,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I have been told amazing things about this gelateria  months  it was opened in Amsterdam. After tasting this gelato I just stopped trying others. Massimo Gelato exceeds any expectations. (Back in Italy for some months, I got constantly ‚Ä¶"
82,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good ice creams, many varieties but somehow I miss cone ;)"
83,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing ice cream available in lots of flavors. Definitely recommend!
84,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,You might think they don‚Äôt look elegant but they are LEKKER! Nice chewy feeling
85,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Definitely best ice cream in Amsterdam. Went there with colleagues who suggested flavours I‚Äôd usually never order and boy, was I surprised! Couldn‚Äôt pick a favourite as everything I tried was delicious. Extremely fresh ingredients (you can ‚Ä¶"
86,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I'm a vegan by any means, but I tried the dark chocolate (huge fan of dark chocolate) vegan ice cream. It was delicious ü§§ you can barely feel the difference. The vegan ice cream just feel lighter than the classic ice cream. A good address ‚Ä¶"
87,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best ice-cream I have tried here. Like in Italy
88,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Until now the best Italian ice cream in town. Originals flavours and you can taste the quality of the ingredients!! If you are in the neighbours you should give a try. P. S. All gluten free.  Second opinion it is even better than the first!! Just amazing!!! üíô üíô üíô
89,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,There is nothing that I can write that expresses how good the ice cream are. Just come and try.
90,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The absolute best ice cream so far in The Netherlands.

Staff was super friendly even with a long queue of people waiting at the very ‚Ä¶"
91,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 months ago,(One of) the best gelato places in Amsterdam
92,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Honestly the best ice cream I've tasted in Amsterdam. They have weekly changing flavours but also have an decent standard selection of home-made ice cream. They even offer some vegan options and several low-sugar options too. If you love it ‚Ä¶
93,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The gelato is very good but accepting only card payments isn't the best imo
94,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing icecream, however, be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes in a queue."
95,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Best ice cream in AMS. Italian.  Be prepared cause you will wait
96,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ice cream was good but not off the charts. Certainly not worth waiting almost 25 minutes in line on a Thursday evening. There are a lot of other ice cream shops that also serve good ice cream in Amsterdam where there is much less of a line. Next time I'll go there instead.
97,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Impeccable vegan gelato. I was blown away by how many options there were for vegan flavours! A whole freezer of them! Best vegan ice cream I have ever tried. Would 100% recommend if you are thinking about coming here.
98,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 1 star ,a year ago,"I agree with others about the expensive price vs tiny portion size. Somehow, I was charged 7 euro for less than 100 ml of gelato. The pistachio gelato has an unpleasant waxy quality. Definitely not worth the long wait (on a busy afternoon, they have only one person helping customers)."
99,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best homemade ice cream in Amsterdam ! The Hazelnut ice cream is seriously delicious üëçüèª
100,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The gelato is really good but there is a huge lack of consistency in the size of the scoops. A couple of times I have been here and they are normal, a couple other times the scoops are really tiny, and the girl with the glasses in ‚Ä¶"
101,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Loved it! Tried couple of combos and both were delicious üòã
102,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Super yummy ice-creams and a lot of vegan flavours as well. The owner is also very friendly and even though he is busy in the back making the ice-cream he comes out to great you and has a lot of personal contact with the customers. And with your coffee you get a small cup with ice-cream (they choose for you though)!
103,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good stuff, writing a review wouldn't do the flavours justice. You have to try it for yourself. There are many places that sell gelato, but so far Massimo's is just better. ‚Ä¶"
104,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had mocha and pistachio ice cream. The mocca was already great, but the pistachio was the best I've had in my 42 years of walking around on this planet. There was a queue outside, I'd say this was 20% service that could be faster, 20% customers taking their sweet time to pick out what they want, and 60% amazing ice cream."
105,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We were there when it first opened. By far the best Gelato/ ice cream you will find in Europe. Massimo is like our modern day Willie Wonka! Our little one loved visiting. The staff is great and truly a family. The pistachio is hands down my ‚Ä¶
106,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm pretty sure this is the best quality ice-cream in Amsterdam. Lovely range of interesting flavours. I had the chocolate with rose and Himalayan salt!
Nice little corner shop that a lot of people are finding their way to. Friendly staff. Well worth a visit."
107,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Most amazing gelato I had. The vanilla is simply great! The pistachio is better then the nut itself, but the chocolate salted caramel is just mind blowing."
108,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very good and tasty gelato. True Italian craftmanship.
109,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best ice cream (home made) in Amsterdam! Full of flavour, original flavours, also vegan options, very kind staff and very good price. There is always a queue! Cannot miss it"
110,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I‚Äôve had 5 ice creams here, love almost all of them. Pistachio 5/5, ricotta and figs 5/5, hazelnut 5/5, except for cheesecake 2/5... tasted more like yogurt as it didn‚Äôt have the funkiness of cheesecakes and missing cake base biscuit ‚Ä¶"
111,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Really lovely ice cream, but the girl behind the counter was so extremely rude i felt bad about myself all evening. Not going back."
112,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The long queues at this place proves how amazing it is. But only after you try their ricotta and caramelized figs ice cream you will understand what it really means! Beat thing- they have amazing vegan options and their ice cream are gluten free ü§ó even non ice cream fans will like it here.. And will become ice cream addicts for sure üòé
113,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Greatest icecream place in Amsterdam. Always queue and busy, but totally worth it!"
114,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I love everything about this shop! Tasty ice-cream, heart-full team, nice location, so authentic. Opened when others not. We will come again soon! Love, love, love!"
115,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 1 star ,a year ago,"I was a frequent customer of Massimo, always trying to go there when I wanted to have ice-cream and recommending to all my friends, as I was thinking it was the best in Amsterdam, until today, seeing the owner's unbelievably rude attitude. ‚Ä¶"
116,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It is truly the most delicious gelato: flavor, texture, consistence as it came directly from Italy! Plus, the stuff is super nice. Can't wait to come by again!"
117,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had been here for the workshop & after that I bought some for home. My husband and I like the gelatos very much. Specifically pistachio is become my favourite and my husband likes chocolado most. I must say Massimo you are one of the finnest in Gelato making. It's amazing!
118,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Oh my God what an AMAZING ice cream! As an Italian I was suspicious but, I've got to say it again... What an AMAZING ice cream! I choose 2 tastes: caff√® del professore & pistacchio. Both amazing but now I know why his gelato al Pistacchio is so famous! Thanks to the super funny Chiara, she helps me a lot."
119,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always a sad moment when the cup is empty.

Definitely the best ice cream place in Amsterdam!"
120,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely a must if you search for the best ice-cream of the entire Amsterdam!!
I have been so many times there and the quality is still so high that is ‚Ä¶"
121,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Not only the best in Amsterdam. The best ever!!! Pistachio is absolutely killing.
Wide variety of vegan ice cream. ‚Ä¶"
122,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved the ice cream, real gilato taste and pistachio flavour is a must try there. Small sitting area too available in the corner. Fruity as well as usual flavor available too"
123,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Gelato was good but quite pricey for what it is at 6.40euros for 2 scoops. Maybe can increase the size of the scoops to make it more worth it. But considering the permanent long queue outside, people don't seem to mind."
124,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Possibly the best gelato in the city. Full of natural flavour and not too much sugar. Low sugar options are also available, highlighting how conscious they are of making natural tasting icecream. We tried 4 flavours and all were delicious. Awesome stuff."
125,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best ice cream of Amsterdam, would compete and win with every ice cream place in Italy as well. Price for a 3 cup ice cream is 4.5‚Ç¨."

127,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,Massimo Gelato was so delicious I did not sop eating to take a picture. That‚Äôs very rare for me. I‚Äôve been to Italy several times and this one immediately takes be back to Rome. Gorgeous.
128,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The smoothest gelato going around - a great range of flavours - u need to try them all - renowned for their hazelnut or pistachio but I can‚Äôt go past the Tiramisu or choc salted Carmel with a second scoop of fiord do latte
129,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"By far best Ice cream in Amsterdam and it could compete with the best ice cream in Italy!! Owner and staff are Italian, fluent in English. Prices are very competitive. Ice cream flavors are all hand-made with natural ingredients according ‚Ä¶"
130,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Top Ice Cream of Amsterdam and not only! This place makes ice cream which is even better than most ice cream shops in Italy. I love all sorbetto tastes! I also recommend the affogato, a must try with a scoop of pistachio or almond! The ‚Ä¶"
131,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Favourite ice cream in AMS no doubt. there are other good one like montepelmo or venetie, but this one is my favorite! Just keep the quality and service up! I kcan imagine is not easy being so popular and having long queues, but if quality and service drops, so will be the popularity! ;)"
132,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best place to eat ice cream in the city. Surrounded by strand of bars, this gelato is always around the corner after a drink. Staff has a happy vibe, adding to your gelato experience!"
133,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Im editing my 5 star review because of today‚Äôs experience. I found out this place little over two years ago and it was by far my favourite ice cream place in the Netherlands. Came here today with friends for the first time after two years, ‚Ä¶"
134,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,9 months ago,They have more vegan flavors than the usual lemon/mango/strawberry which is an amazing plus!
135,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My friend recommended this place to me, because he knows I am a fan of Italian food (and, in fact, of Italy :)) This is a truly amazing gelato, such a fresh taste! I also recommend to try espresso ginseng (not so common thing to find!). These five stars are actually ten - five more from my wife :)"
136,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place serves the best pistachio ice-cream I've ever tasted. However I have to point out the negatives.. the first time my bf and I went, I got a the pistachio and he got another flavour, despite ordering the same one scoop, mine was 3 ‚Ä¶"
137,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,My all time favorite gelato place!!!! The thing is they still keep their quality in the plenty of flavors they offer!!! Will definitely come back again and again!
138,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best gelato ever. Very big choice of vegan flavours . And everything is freshly made in the shop self. Don‚Äôt get scared of the queue, it goes very fast and is unavoidable with this quality of ice cream."
139,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best place to get gelato in Amsterdam. The service is always friendly and welcoming. There are special flavours that change regularly which means there is always something new to try. The pistachio gelato is my favourite flavour. It is worth the wait in line!
140,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"No superlatives to describe how good the gelato is, I am partial to the pistachio flavor. Our goto ice cream spot in the neighborhood. Their shakes are not bad either."
141,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Freshly made with amazing quality. Ice cream ingredients are on display. It can be difficult to chose a selection as each option is busting with flavor. Probably the best ice cream experience of my life.
142,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best gelato in town! You have to go there at least once!
143,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow! Gelato with a big G! One of the best I‚Äôve ever had! However, not only it stands out for its gelato but also for its great and friendly staff (I was always served by Italian staff btw). I strongly recommend pistacchio and nocciola. If, like me, you are a nostalgic Italian resident here in Amsterdam, this is the right place for you!"
144,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very authentic Italian ice cream! Yummmyyyyy
145,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best ice cream place in Pijp. There's always a line and they deserve it. Even though it's super busy the service is always great, they are cheerful and happy to help. Big yes!"
146,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great ice cream in many flavours, both traditional and more unusual. There is also a good selection of vegan ice creams which taste great. Friendly and warm service. A great spot to sit and have a coffee or something sweet."
147,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best ice cream of Amsterdam. If the weather is good, prepare for a 20-25 minutes waiting.  That's why, I prefer rainy days or trying to be there at 12:00."
148,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The ice cream in this place is just phenomenal! Staff also super friendly! When visiting, mind the massive queue!"
149,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Definitely the best gelato I've found in Amsterdam. I had two scoops: one was Himalayan salt/chocolate and the other was ricotta, fig, and cinnamon. Both tasted great, but the ricotta was a must-try. There are a couple of places to sit, but not much space, so plan to visit this place for a to-go gelato to be enjoyed in the nearby park."
150,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Don‚Äôt be put off if the queue goes out the door and down the street... it‚Äôs moves pretty quickly and it‚Äôs well worth the wait! ‚Ä¶

I think you are the best ice cream place in Amsterdam but you should become even better by recycling the waste as you got so much plastic and paper , please make separate bins for cups and plastic spoons. Be environment friendly in all it's means! Thank you üåøüíö"
155,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I dare say that this gelato is better than any gelato I had in Italy. Absolutely amazing flavours, high quality gelato - can't get enough of it, and I have to make a stop at Massimo's every weekend. I would stand in line for their gelato ‚Ä¶"

159,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went on a Sunday night and there was still a line up. The line went fast. It‚Äôs absolutely delicious! Nice seating outside and really quick service. Their cheesecake and berries gelato is def worth the 5 stars alone.
160,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 2 stars ,a year ago,You'll queue for 30min to get too sweet and chemical flavoured ice-cream. This place is successful because there isn't other option in the neighborhood.
161,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing amazing  ice cream, lots of flavours, including a few original ones, vegan options as well. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I couldn't recommend it more. Stop by, it's totally worth it!"

164,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited last night, first time. I have been to Italy several times, Tuscany, Molise and always try ice cream. Massimo's is better than any I have tasted in Italy, superb!"
165,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good ice cream. 4 stars because to my taste the ice cream wasn‚Äôt kept cold enough in the shop. It also would be nice if they actually spoke Dutch as well.
166,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'll try and keep it short, I will be going back! I had actually gone to the Albert Cuyp to have ice cream at the Yoghurt Barn but they were no longer there, instead it's now some kind of toasty sandwich restaurant. I was pointed in the ‚Ä¶"

171,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,a year ago,If you aren't using your Fitbit's 10K step goal to make daily icecream runs what did you really but it for?? Navigate yourself to this glorious gelateria and pretend that you're in Italy. You won't regret it
172,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best icecream in town, hands down. Went all over Italy but didn't find a pistachio icecream as good as the pistachio at Massimo. Seriously, write me a message if you can find better icecream in the city."
173,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wow. What a treat! Doesn‚Äôt get better than this spot in terms of ice cream in Amsterdam.
174,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 3 stars ,6 months ago,It was a bit overrated. No need for the long line since the gelato was not that good.
175,Ijswinkel Massimo Gelato, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I live near the shop and had many times ice cream from this place. Today, while I was enjoying an ice cream on the bench outside the shop I saw one of the employees trying to put a lot of plastic and cred boards in the garbage bins outside ‚Ä¶"
