0,De Engelbewaarder, 1 star ,6 months ago,"After waiting for 15 min to finally order we waited 50 min for our food and got this sad bread for 6€. Staff is pretty slow and the one serving us was a bit rude. Didn’t even clean the tables.
Location is nice tho."
1,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Absolutely beautiful little local bar with restaurant area in the back. Great selection of drinks.
This is one of my favourite bars in Amsterdam, with a great atmosphere. Super lively on a weekend."
2,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,First of... the view is beautiful and this place is one of the coziest places in Amsterdam center. If you are lucky enough to sit by the window you will love it  even more. …
3,De Engelbewaarder, 1 star ,5 months ago,Poor service; first order took 30 minutes to arrive.  Subsequent orders were quicker but the bill was again inexplicably delayed. Great location but the blasé wait staff doesn't make me want to come again.
4,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Walking past, one hardly sees the interior of this popular beer house and restaurant. But at peak times, a mostly-older (but loud) crowd fills this no-nonsense pair of first-floor rooms, either drinking the very wide selection of beers on …"
5,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,a month ago,The steak was great.
6,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favorite local places to have a beer in Amsterdam. Terrace outside has till late the sun. Good beer selection, live jazz on Sunday and even the bitterballen are tasty!"
7,De Engelbewaarder, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Waitress forgot our food more than once and never came back to check on us. Great atmosphere appauling service. How difficult is an order of nuts, blocks of cheese and sliced sausage?"
8,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there twice, both times were amazing. Good apple pie and nice hot chocolate.
Deep fried food looked like it had a bit old oil but tasted good enough. Staff is friendly and there are board games available!"
9,De Engelbewaarder, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent jazz, beer not overpriced. You might be intimidated to go in solo but you’ll be ok if you squeeze in some corner. Yes, actually I was the only Asian in this shop"
10,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very nice and quiet place. The waitress was very kind and the drinks were really good. I recommend it!
11,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Pic is view from terrace at flat boat. Perfect spot in the p.m.-sun. Location itself is cosy, brown and clean. Friendly owner!"
12,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"(Updated to 5 stars) Great beer and atmosphere. Food has improved a lot and is very good. Fast service for what they have to put up with (stairs, tourists, road, etc). I appreciate the wait staff, they hustle."
13,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Okay drinks and okay atmosphere.  I didn’t experience anything extraordinary.
14,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,7 months ago,One of the nicest and peaceful channels in Amsterdam.
15,De Engelbewaarder, 1 star ,a year ago,Terrible service! We seated and watched the waitress walk around past us about 10 times until we finally caught her attention by waiving. She brought our drinks and forgot our snacks as she was mostly chatting with other customer who were her friends. Not ever coming back!
16,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great beer selection and ambiance, whether visiting in the afternoon or evening. The food is also excellent, with large size portions (a main is more than enough, in my experience). It's often pretty busy in the evenings, so be prepared to sit at the bar."
17,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We went into the Guardian Angel following a literary tour from a local. It was a nice, quiet place, with a 70's/80's decôr that evoked a stimulating, creative atmosphere. The mint tea was refreshing and the apple cake (or pie) was the best …"
18,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fabulous place to go on Sunday afternoons for the live Jazz Jam Session.  Service is excellent, a wide choice of beers and on top of that they have a super menu, not just standard Dutch fare.  All the locals are friendly!!  You never know who will show up to jam, some well known Sax players!!"
19,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Can't really remember a lot of the night I was in there but as my intention was to go in and do exactly that I guess its good! from what I can remember the atmosphere was great with lots of singing and the bar staff where really friendly to us even though the majority of the people drinking in there were locals.
20,De Engelbewaarder, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good beer and live jazz. Expensive, crowded and the staff to busy and somewhat disorganized. It will no doubt be better at a quieter time, but we drank our beer and took off. Even paying the bill was a hassle. It is still known as a literary café, but that was true on the old days. Now it feels like a.cash cow ..."
21,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I come here for dinner and some beers each time I'm in Amsterdam for work. Top-notch food at a good price, 19 independent beers on tap, a nice crowd of locals & super friendly staff that always make me feel at home away from home. A real gem"
22,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The classic Amsterdam ""eetcafé"" - an eating pub.  At the same time a very good restaurant at reasonable prices and a packed pub (when there's not a pandemic on), not yet overrun with tourists."
23,De Engelbewaarder, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The food was delicious but the server seemed completely oblivious to us even though we were sitting in the middle of the dining room. I had to ask three times to get a beer and even after the third try it took a good 10 minutes for her to remember.
24,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Lively spot for drinks or dinner. Good selection of beers on tap and bottle. It's a popular spot with the locals, and if you'd like to have dinner you should make a reservation in advance."
25,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Nice selection of beers. Good stop for a drink.
26,De Engelbewaarder, 1 star ,5 years ago,I have previously had good food and service however today it was dreadful to the point I will not go back.  My friends Coffee came warm and not hot as did my hot chocolate.  The waitress reluctantly warmed up the HC but said there was …
27,De Engelbewaarder, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst service we've experienced... Ever.
Food took 1hour + to come out, not kidding.
We didn't all get the food at the same time, first 2, then another 2, and after …"
28,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,4 years ago,On Sunday's there's a jam session. Great café on Kloveniersburgwal
29,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good beer, lovely food and great staff"
30,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Sunday afternoon jazz is great. They need to replace the bungee cord on hanging loudspeakers before they drop on somone. Great dinners are a surprise for the laid back decore.
31,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love, love, love this place. Great for a drink or a meal. As this is more like a great bar that also serves a good dinner as opposed to a cafe, the dinner menu is far more impressive than the lunch menu."
32,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had great beers there! There are benches along the canal, which makes it super pleasant to have a beer outside! I highly recommend and the staff is super nice!"
33,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Always great atmosphere !

36,De Engelbewaarder, 1 star ,5 months ago,Slow service. 40 minutes for a beer.
37,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great spot for after work Belgian beers. When it's sunny you can sit outside by the canal. Dinner options are good.
38,De Engelbewaarder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great sourdough bread and Sunday jazz
39,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great beers and food and a relaxed atmosphere, but the staff is a bit too slow. Waited 20 until I could order..."
40,De Engelbewaarder, 3 stars ,a year ago,Service is very slow: we ordered sandwiches and soup of the day from the lunch menu. We have been waiting already 30 minutes or more...
41,De Engelbewaarder, 4 stars ,a year ago,One of the better terraces in town for late summer chilling. Good burgers to boot.
