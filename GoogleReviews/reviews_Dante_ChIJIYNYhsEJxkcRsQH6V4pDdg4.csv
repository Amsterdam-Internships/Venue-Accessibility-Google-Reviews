2,Dante, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Outstanding food and service.  The pizza is the best I've had in Europe.
3,Dante, 2 stars ,a month ago,"The staff is very rude! You almost need to go and prepare your own drink and food. The food is average and the drinks have nothing extraordinary. I won‚Äôt return, and I would definitely not recommend this place"
4,Dante, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly staff, good food (hot). Really nice atmosphere on the canals edge."
5,Dante, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"very delicious pizza, unfortunately for eating desserts the kitchen was already closed at 9:30pm"
6,Dante, 1 star ,5 months ago,"We sat outside for over 30 minutes and didn‚Äôt even get a menu card. The waiters ignored us and it‚Äôs clearly not a priority to them to treat their costumers well. We went to the restaurant next to it and got served by a very nice, humerus waiter immediately."
7,Dante, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"We waited for an hour for our food and the burger was overcooked - dry and hard.
It's huge restaurant with tiny kitchen and they can't possibly serve all the ‚Ä¶"
8,Dante, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Dante is a beautiful and cozy restaurant with a very good menu and nice wines, you can sit at the Singel as well as on the Spuistraat side. The service is very kind and professional. I would love to come here back soon!"
9,Dante, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Not amazing. We waited 1 hours to have food (and there wasn't that many people in the restaurant). The food was okay but expensive and for the waiting time not really worth it. Go to another restaurant in this street, you'll have much better options."
10,Dante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pleasant, helpful staff. Good size meals with tasty food. We had the Linguini Vongole, the Nachos, Chicken Caesar Salad and Margarita Pizza."

12,Dante, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Service was really good. It was cold outside and I got a blanket. The dishes were ok, it was good but not overwhelming. Nice location !"
13,Dante, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Service fairly quick and our waiter was lovely, food did the job for two hungry walkers but wouldn't go out of our way to revisit."
14,Dante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great spot for drinks and food. Staff was friendly and food was good. Walking distance from where we were staying. Loved the look and good selection of drinks.

16,Dante, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great place and nice crew. LOVE their fresh smoothies!!!
17,Dante, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"For me, medhideluxe is the best. Pasta was cold and too expensive."
18,Dante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The penne with spicy chilli sauce is single handedly the best pasta I have ever had. Stumbled here last year when I was on a trip to Amsterdam and made a point to come back just for the pasta. The bread is also amazing and for 5 euro it is worth it. The service is friendly and quick depending on when you come.
19,Dante, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"First stop when landed in amsterdam was to get some lunch and drinks, saw this little place and gave it a go, the hotdog was amazing and chips were great. Nicely priced and located."

42,Dante, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had a pizza and a salad. The waiter showed up right after we sat down and asked for drinks, we ordered right after and (I swear to every bacon on the planet) after about 5 minutes he showed up with a great tasting pizza and a fantastic salad. The service was fast and caring (cheers to Rapha√´l!) and very affordable. Thanks!"

46,Dante, 1 star ,2 years ago,Don't bother ordering any food on the menu. Waited 1.5 hrs for them to tell me that they're starting to work on my steak and spaghetti. Left the establishment right afterwards. They serve drinks quickly though...
47,Dante, 4 stars ,4 months ago,It was lovely and the food was delicious.
48,Dante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best hotdog I've ever had in my life! The staff are friendly, multi-lingual and the food is well-priced and absolutely delicious. We ordered hotdogs, burgers and linguine which tasted fantastic. Highly recommended!"
49,Dante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love this place. I tried it out because it has mu son's name and I have to say it was a great choice. The menu is diverse and the food is exquisitely replendant. The waiters are freindly and inviting as well as the service being on point. Definatly get the Dante burger that thing is absolutly fantastic.
50,Dante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pizza arrived a bit cold. Sweet potatoes were yummy.
51,Dante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place to meet up, or grab some food. The staff are good, and while I've given it four stars it can sometimes feel a bit flat, perhaps it's too big on those winters nights, but in the summertime it can really generate a great ‚Ä¶"

53,Dante, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Really nice atmosphere with outdoor space on both sides so you can chase the sunshine.  Good wine and beer selection.  Food was delicious as well.  Gorgeous two story bar that looks even better from the top floor
54,Dante, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Service is bad (we sat for 15 minutes before we actually went and stood in front of the waitress to get served), 1 burger came out medium and the other blue (having asked for medium) and then the staff were convinced that it was medium and ‚Ä¶"

56,Dante, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Lovely decoration and polite staff however I think the food is a little over priced and the menu a little restrictive on choice.  I have eaten here several times and cannot fault the quality. ‚Ä¶
57,Dante, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The service is slow but kind. The menu limited but good for a quick bite. Coffee is not that good but cocktails are nice! The location is great with tables outside but protected from air or rain.
58,Dante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It was a special experience. The cooks has explained every piece of meal they cooked and did the whole process before our eyes. It was worth every minute and every bit of food.
59,Dante, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Really really bad service for Amsterdam.
Waitresses dounfortunately do not pay attention at all and asking you 3 times if you really still want to have the nachos which you have ordered 40 /60 and 80 min before. Finally we left..."
60,Dante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I really don‚Äôt understand the 3,9 rating. It was some of the best pasta and risotto we ever had. You have a great view, friendly staff and very very good food."

65,Dante, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"While on our first night (2nd trip) here from America, we decided to walk around to familiarize ourselves with the area (staying in Jordaan), we stopped at Dante for the very rustic-modern decor that is scaling throughout Pinterest and the ‚Ä¶"
66,Dante, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Fast service. Rather small portions for the pasta dishes. They offer bread when ordering the drinks, but this costs 5 euros. The bread itself was good."
67,Dante, 1 star ,5 months ago,Low level food and overpriced bottle of water.
68,Dante, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Ok, so it's not quick. But there is a full bar with Fritz, an excellent mixologist. The music is chill and atmosphere cozy.

69,Dante, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The staff is very friendly and food is good !
70,Dante, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place. Too strict with the table and chairs arrangement. We had to wait for a table for four while there was a free table for two where they denied to bring two more chairs to accommodate us.
71,Dante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had the penne all'arrabbiata, olives and homemade fries for dinner with my partner. All tasted amazing would highly recommend, price was reasonable as well and good location on street front"
72,Dante, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Slow service, unremarkable to inedible food (incredibly bitter steak salad in particular). When confronted with the steak, and admitting the bad taste, only offered excuses... Would not go there again."
73,Dante, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Stopped here for lunch, nice place with some good food, slightly limited menu but what's on it is great! Central location, polite staff. Good little spot."
74,Dante, 4 stars ,6 years ago,This is a great place to come if you want a good atmosphere and some good pub food. I had the burger which was delicious. Very friendly staff.
75,Dante, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"A nice place, good food in Front of the water !"
76,Dante, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cannot describe their carpaccio. You have to try it yourself. Cosy place just behind corner of busy loud streets on canal bank. Perfect in so many ways. Also popular, so expect it to be full..."

My wife had the seafood pasta and I went for the ""Fungi Truffle"" pizza which i can safely say was one of the best pizzas I've ever had!!"
211,Dante, 1 star ,a week ago,"WARNING!!!

The service takes so long, you need to ask them to reheat the food before it actually arrives. The cocktails had no alcohol whatsoever, so only alcoholfree drinks."
