0,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Awesome please with an awesome food on a reasonable price!
1,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Beyond the incredible food and service, they treat you like family. My wife and I came to Amsterdam to round out our honeymoon trip and the next time we return, we will be sure to visit Pizzeria Portofino to recreate our great memories."
2,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great food with nice outdoor seats
3,Porto Fino, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice little place, I had a calazone pizza which was pretty good, my wife had Salmon and my daughter had the sea bass which was all well cooked. Tbe service we received was also good."
4,Porto Fino, 1 star ,7 months ago,"This is NOT an Italian restaurant. They can‚Äôt even spell Portofino correctly. The service is bad, some staff is downright rude. Tables and deck outside are filthy. Food is low quality. If you want a bad taste of how Egyptians take on Italian dishes, this is your place."
5,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Had pizzas but I wasn't impressed. Didn't even finish. The main issue is the dough, I like it thin and crisp"
6,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Ordered Carpaccio...it came out mostly frozen and watery. To top it off...powdered parmesan cheese. This place obviously relies on its location instead of food to bring in customers.
7,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Our group of 4 happened across this restaurant as we looked for a place for dinner.  We enjoyed the waiter and the food.  Three vegetarians among us and all found good options although none of us had pizza.  Most of the people around us ‚Ä¶
8,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place! Pleasant atmosphere! Friendly staff! üëç
9,Porto Fino, 1 star ,a year ago,"Absolutely not recommendable.  The most horrible restaurant visit of our lives.

At first we waited half an eternity for the food, although nobody was there. ‚Ä¶"
10,Porto Fino, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Service,and ambient was great ,but you should rly avoid eating calamari here.Overpriced and no taste at all plus not to mention sallat that was proly only washed under water (maybe)"
11,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Not the best pizza, pretty standard, nothing special. Me & my friend were the only two people in the Pizzeria accompanied by an overly friendly owner who wouldn't let us eat in peace. Amusingly at one point we thought he was asking if we ‚Ä¶"
12,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very FRIENDLY and surprisingly tasty pizza for the cheap price.
13,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The service was terrible, not only we sat in front of a waiter who ignored us for 10 minutes. When it was time to go, we paid the bill and he pointed at the credit card and said ""Tip Tip Tip"". I was shocked. A  tourist trap. But complements to the chief who made a delicious pizza."
14,Porto Fino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"More than pizza, a well positioned restaurant with a broad selection of all your Italian favourites, and reasonable prices"
15,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This pizza is to die for! Just happened to pass by and saw the pizza being served and I had to stop in! And I am so glad I did! The service was brilliant and the pizzas were perfect and out very fast even though it was a busy summer months. ‚Ä¶
16,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"very nice and kind people, I love that you can sit near the water and the food is also very delicious!"
17,Porto Fino, 1 star ,2 years ago,The worst restaurant experience EVER! It has nothing to do with Italy or with the prices they put in front of the restaurant (trying to get people to come inside and than ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù them with prices).. the food I saw on the table where a ‚Ä¶

20,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very tasty and *real* Italian food! It's cozy and well-cleaned compared to what you'd expect. The staff are very friendly and happy. And the price is good. üëç
21,Porto Fino, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Ambiance ok, brisk service. However, portions can be small, waiter said he didn't have any tap water when I asked for some, and when paying the bill he refused to give me the change (of 4 euros) telling me that this was for him!? ‚Ä¶"
22,Porto Fino, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Visited this place 16th September 2016
Food was ok, but I have never come across such rude and abrupt staff in all my life. ‚Ä¶"
23,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Stopped here as close to our hotel although my food was ok, Raviolli type dish (can't remember the exact name),  my wife's Spaghetti Bolognese was really watery and the waiter seemed to just want us out as quickly as possible. Almost like he wanted to close early. Definitely give this place a miss."
24,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Pollo is a great waiter.  Great service.  Very cozy place by the canal and bridge.
25,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Indoors the place has a weird smell. If you order coke you get black sugary water on tap, almost without gas. I mentioned it to the waiter and it became obvious he hates his job and blames customers. The food arrived late and did improve the first impression a little."
26,Porto Fino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"AVOID!!!

27,Porto Fino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent prices and food, but service was not so great. Rude waiter. They would't even show us the desert menu, after asking around 4 times."
28,Porto Fino, 1 star ,4 years ago,The pasta was overcooked and had no taste at all. They tried to cover it by puting way to much pepperoni. Service isn't good neither! The only positive is that they serve beer üòÑ
29,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food was tasty, the personal is very friendly and prices are ok, especially for Amsterdam. I would definitely recommend the restaurant."
30,Porto Fino, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly people obviously family run. Very fresh food and gorgeously tasty. Great value for money well worth it. Good location not right on busy car fumed road but overlooking canal.
31,Porto Fino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Food was horrible for all 3 people in my party, service was very lacking as well as all 3 wait staff were clearly intoxicated. Far better choices available within a couple of minutes from here"
32,Porto Fino, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"We didn't leave Pizzaria Portofino as happy as we entered. Watch out: the portions are way too small to be called a full meal. The pizza's are a bit tasteless and the lasagne is about the size of a donut. The prices are high (a glass of coca cola for 3,5 euro) and we couldn't split the bill. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
33,Porto Fino, 1 star ,2 years ago,Don't go here. Very unfriendly to customers.. You get ripped of your money and the quality is disgusting. The man who received our order was on his phone all the time and he tried to make jokes... 4 Persons ate there and all of us were very unhappy.
34,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had an excellent pizza here during a day trip to Amsterdam. I‚Äôd go as far to say, one of the best. Excellent service too."
35,Porto Fino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unfriendly staff, mediocre food, right after ordering food we were asked to pay in advance before receiving our plate. Would not recomend to anyone."
36,Porto Fino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Pizza was Bad.
Service was terrible. Forced us to eat our Pizza in 15 minutes and sneaked around us the whole Time. ‚Ä¶"
37,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Imagine an Italian restaurant that doesn't bring pepper or parmesan to the table with your pasta unless you ask for it. Imagine an Itslian restaurant that doesn't bring bread, olive oil or balsamic before you get your food. The pasta is not inedible but it is nothing other than ordinary."
38,Porto Fino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good munchies-style food. I had the artichoke pizza. Like many places in town,  they do not take American Express #noamex."
39,Porto Fino, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Nothing special here. It's a tiny restaurant with okay food. My meal filled me up but it might have been slightly overpriced... but cheaper than some other places around. The staff aren't very talkative or friendly, but the guy wasn't rude either, so I can't complain."
40,Porto Fino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Wouldn't go there again. Pasta was way overcooked, no grated cheese - had to ask for it.  Seriously, for an Italian restaurant which should cook decent meals, it was pathetic."
41,Porto Fino, 1 star ,2 years ago,Service is terrible. Food not special at all. Pizza far from a real Napolitana pizza nor Roman. Try to avoid spending time and money at this place.
42,Porto Fino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"2018/04 2 Pizzas (Quatro formaggi and Calzione) and one Bolognese. Was average not too tasty or spicy, nothing special. Service was also average."
43,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place.Superfriendly waiter/service. Located close to one of the ""Grachten"". Great Pizza and Pasta."
44,Porto Fino, 1 star ,2 years ago,The place is practicly a tourist trap. Service is bad and the owner is mean and not supportive. Please save you money and pick another nice place to eat in Amstedam.
45,Porto Fino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This is not Italian restaurant, food is called the same but is of terrible quality. ‚Ä¶"
46,Porto Fino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely place to eat. Food v good and not too expensive.  Seems family run and staff very friendly.
47,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was not good, I wouldn't say awfull but really not tasty. Frozen meals are better.
Cheap price, and service is fine but not great."
48,Porto Fino, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Don t get tricked by the good prices, the food is mediocre and comes in small portions. Fries are from the supermarket, mayo and ketchup from packs, two leafes of salad. ..."
49,Porto Fino, 1 star ,3 years ago,Nice location. Rude female staff who practically took the table from us when closing the restaurant!! Very bad treatment. Food just ok and overpriced
50,Porto Fino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Was great food but people ordered after us was served first waited over an hour such a shame and no apologies
51,Porto Fino, 1 star ,4 years ago,This was without a doubt the worst restaurant I‚Äôve ever eaten at. Food quality was appalling and the service nearly as bad. Do not eat here.
52,Porto Fino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice welcome, good value for money compared to other places around. Food was good we ate here twice during our short stay."
