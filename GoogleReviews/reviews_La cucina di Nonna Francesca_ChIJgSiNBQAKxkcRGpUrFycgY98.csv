2,La cucina di Nonna Francesca, 1 star ,5 years ago,"This ""restaurant"" advertises themselves in their shop window as ""versgemaakte"".. freshly made. So the last thing you expect is to be served pre made pizza. Yet that's exactly what we got. I even watched them pull it out of the wrapper and heat it up. Next time I want cardboard I'll get some from Albert Heijn, thanks"
