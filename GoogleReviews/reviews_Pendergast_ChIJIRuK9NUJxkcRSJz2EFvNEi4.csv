0,Pendergast, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"A good place for an American BBQ meal. We ordered a sharing option that came with beef cheek, beef rib, pork rib plus sides of potato mash, Mac n cheese and salad. The meats were perfectly cooked and fall of the bone. The flavours were nice …"
1,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"A piece of ‘the south’ in Amsterdam. Americans can do one thing like no other: barbecue. This is the first place in Amsterdam, or rather the Netherlands, that really understands the barbeque as it is intended, with all the taste buds that …"
2,Pendergast, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Decent food, good service. Don't expect any steaks and such because everything is smoked beforehand! The side dishes were really good. We had the brisket and pork cheeks which are probably the most popular dishes."
3,Pendergast, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Heavenly taste, first time having brisket and not the last one.
The Place is unique, deco super simple, but cozy, the staff is super friendly.
now I understand why needed to book almost a week in advance. 💛💛"
4,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Ordered brisket and ribs. Both of them are great. Will definitely go again to try other main courses. Chocolate pecan cake was also so good. You won't regret
5,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I went to Pendergast without realizing that I’ve been there years ago. But once again, the food, the vibes, the service surprised me… everything was so good, so smooth (from the main to side dishes, especially the mashed potatoes) Thank you for existing 😇😇😇"

The meat was so tender! More than perfect bite! Staffs are friendly and helpful!"
7,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a month ago,Fantastic brisket and ribs. Fried burnt ends are the must-have you didn’t know you needed. Lemon cake is amazing. …
8,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent pulled pork and ribs. The pulled pork has a strong bbq flavor. The brisket could be a bit more salty. …
9,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 months ago,I’ve eaten here before and it was amazing but I also just had it delivered and it was absolutely perfect. Really pleased with everything and packaged correctly and the food is so delicious.
10,Pendergast, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"I quite like this place! Been back three times since I discovered it a month ago. The food can be a tad inconsistent (sometimes too salty) but when it is good, which it usually is, it’s great. Highlights are the corn bread, brisket and Mac and cheese. Staff is wonderfully friendly too"
11,Pendergast, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, great beer selection, a must visit if you like authentic BBQ food.

We started with the deep fried brisket burnt ends, think ""bitterballen"" but made …"
12,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for meat lovers, but you can find could salads too. Brisket was great, all the pork options amazing. We got to try all the side dishes. The beans with meat super. Corn bread tasty. Even the turkey was excellent. Only the mac and …"
13,Pendergast, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"The food and the drinks were delicious, if a little pricey. A style of food you won't find very easily in Amsterdam. …"
14,Pendergast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Meat lover's paradise.  The brisket was excellent, and so were the ribs. Service was friendly and very good.  Highly recommended.  I have one request for the management:  please keep some American wines - and Sam Adams!"
15,Pendergast, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"High quality and plenty quantity authentic comfort food in a cozy setting. The wine, cocktails also were a hit. The host is a very attentive and amiable person who will make you feel right at home. Definitely making a return visit as soon as possible highly recommended +++++"
16,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 months ago,A small cozy establishment with very friendly people and awesome food. I had the brisket and it was delicious! I prefer this over any steak any day! It was super tender and full of flavor!
17,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"KC bbq in Amsterdam!! I have only been once but will be back. They smoke the meats in house and all the sides are homemade as well.
We started with some delicious cocktails and the fried burnt ends. The burnt …"
18,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing cocktails, delicious brisket."

22,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Enjoyed my visit to Pendergast. It is a small restaurant so making a reservation is recommended. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Meat is of good quality, I would not recommend the salmon, compared to for example the brisket or …"
23,Pendergast, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice staff, great food. Pork ribs was my favourite. Some dishes did need longer marinade for more flavour."
24,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm generally not a fan of food in Amsterdam but Pendegast deserves its praise. It is all about meat here and the focus of the restaurant. But, vegetarians like me has a fab option in the seitan (even looks like meat) and many sides to choose from."
25,Pendergast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very special to have been here and taste the American way of food. Well done, new flavours and textures I have tasted. Don't be afraid of carbs, salt and fat. But ones in a while it is great."
26,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Cute little restaurant with one of the best BBQ meat I've ever eaten! The host was also very nice & attentive.
27,Pendergast, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Where do I begin..

Service was slow i.e had to ask for the menu 🙄 …"
28,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Glad to get a table, thanks for calling us from the waitlist. Food was awesome, both the ribs and the brisket, sides too! Can recommend!"
29,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful little restaurant with amazing food. As a man from the south, I know my BBQ, and they do it very well here. Very satisfied with not only the food but the staff as well. Highly recommend!"
30,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Holy COW! This was the best meat I’ve eaten in all of Amsterdam. I can not recommend this epic bbq grill enough. Please go and eat to your hearts content! The sharing platter was more than enough - we ordered 2 sharing platters for 6 people total and it was incredible. I won’t have to eat for days now 😂
31,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing bbq and sides.  The wine was great and the cocktails looked amazing. Really nice service as well.
32,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I am not even sure I should post a review being afraid that once people discover this hidden gem I may never be able to find an available table :) Best meat place I have ever eaten in, period"
33,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow! I very, very rarely eat meat but this was absolutely worth it. I had the fried burnt brisket ends and fried turkey as a starter and the brisket with a side of Mac and cheese as main and everything was divine. I'd been wanting to try …"
34,Pendergast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Quality food and nice service! I particularly liked the De Max cocktail, perfect for summer. I also liked the fact that the restaurant is small and cozy although the acoustics are not the best (it was hard to have a conversation 😅)"
35,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious dinner at Pendergast last night. My favorites were the brisket, pork ribs, mashed potato and baked beans. They have a nice selection of craft beers as well. Looking forward to visiting again already."
36,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"As always, it was sublime: great food, cocktails with a twist, and a nice, cosy setting. Brandon and his crew never let you down."
37,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Omg don't book a seat here. Leave them all for me. This place is amazing. Beef ribs and brisket never disappoint.
38,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best meats in Amsterdam, pulled pork was sensational. Cocktails are really good as well, staff is very friendly but might take a while to serve you on busy evenings. …"
39,Pendergast, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"A simple small venue, with laser focus on smoked meats - and some alternatives available. If you appreciate butter-soft slow-cooked meat, give this a try. Old Pal is a great cocktail pairing with its bitter taste to contrast the charred meats."
40,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 months ago,This place is a must try with its delicious barbecue and tasty sides. The atmosphere is cute and the staff is very friendly.
41,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Was here with a group of colleagues for a team dinner (one of them gave a recommendation for the place). Now I can wholeheartedly recommend it as well - very nice slow cooked meat (I think it was a bit smoked as well). Good service, cozy atmosphere. Would love to visit again."
42,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It’s a hidden gem (maybe not anymore after this review), among the best meat I tried in Amsterdam. Tiny restaurant with a cool interior."
43,Pendergast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Legit. The only place that makes me feel like I’m at a classy, elevated BBQ joint in the south. Drink menu is excellent, food is the kind you do not want to eat every week (but only for health reasons). …"
44,Pendergast, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Lovely little American BBQ place with a nice atmosphere and some of the most tender brisket I've ever had. Can't wait to go again!
45,Pendergast, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Excellent food and service. The brisket is a must and the pork ribs are the best I've tried in Amsterdam. Important to mention the Butchers Tears tap beer, the perfect match for the BBQ. I will come back for sure."
46,Pendergast, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very good Kansas style BBQ is this small joint. Super friendly staff and great food. Nice drink menu with lots of special liquors and good selection of craft beers.
47,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and service. The plate didn't seem like a lot of food, but it turned out to be more than enough. The ribs were really juicy, it was perfect. The sides were a little disappointing."
48,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Simply put, the absolute best smoke house in Amsterdam. Hands down.

Only slightly negative points: small place, so don't go with 20 people; and the wines are not my favorite. The beers largely compensate, though!!"
49,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Awesome food, great cocktails and good service!
The brisket and beef ribs were just perfect! One of the best places I've tried in Amsterdam. …"
50,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Pieces of meat that melt on your tongue, fresh coleslaw, pickled sour vegetables and creamy beans."
51,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing BBQ, quick service and very friendly!  Try the share plate you won't regret it (Mac and cheese side dish, cheese is life) I we t here with my brother and the food and service is amazing, 5 out of 5 stars, this is real BBQ!"
52,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food was absolutely delicious. I had the vegetarian version and loved it. My friend had meat and said it was one of the best he ever had.
53,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My favorite restaurant in all of Amsterdam. It’s always great food and amazing service. All the sides are amazing, the smoked meat is amazing. Nothing not to love here. Specifically I love the cornbread, baked beans, and brisket."
54,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great food! I particularly love their brisket and they meaty beans. The also make a wicked pecan pie. …
55,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really good impressive ! You have to taste it !
56,Pendergast, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Incredible food! Ribs are super impressive
57,Pendergast, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"A real-deal southern BBQ — superb meat and sides. Brisket is to die for. Stop reading, just book yourself a table here."
58,Pendergast, 1 star ,a year ago,"I ordered from this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. I have to tell you that we were all enormously DISAPPOINTED! The Mac and cheese was just pasta with cheese, the beef ribs and brisket was super salty even to be able to eat it, and the portions are tiny! It’s overpriced and I would NEVER order from here again!"
59,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I cleaned my plate!  Excellent selection of authentic, smoky barbeque. We got the brisket and pork cheek - yum. My cocktail was terrific, and they have a solid collection of bourbon and rye. Finished it off with chocolate pecan pie served with bourbon whipped cream.  Highly recommend."
60,Pendergast, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I liked the place, the side dishes are great, I liked the cocktails collection, the tall guy is super friendly and really helpful. The meat however was unfortunately too salty. We told them and they didn’t charge us for that dish. I do …"
61,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had to walk quite a bit of distance to get here since this place is a bit far from the city centre. However, it was totally worth it. The food was great. We tried to make a reservation (always do that for this place or call and check) …"
62,Pendergast, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Here I prefer ribs over brisket. Sides could be a little bit bigger. Nice quick service. Even though the beers choice is small the options are interesting.
63,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food , the brisket and the pulled pork  were amazing... I also liked the side dishes !! The beans and pulled pork also amazing!!"
64,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Insanely good restaurant! Have been here multiple times and it's always absolutely delicious. Small menu, but everything is done to perfection. The brisket is out of this world! Have always been far too stuffed from the mains to try a …"
65,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Excellent. Recommend the brisket and the ribs. Loved the salad sides!
66,Pendergast, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Loved it. Loved it. Loved it! As an ex KCMO citizen it felt like coming home. Great food. Great service. No nonsense... and eh.. killer cocktails!
67,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic BBQ food and very nice service! We ordered the ""Spread"" to share between the two of us with beef brisket (finger lickin 'good!!), pork ribs and cheeks. Everything was delicious, including the sides, and the portions are generous. …"
68,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazingly good place for slow cooked braised meat.  Beef brisket is a must to have. On top of That, the side dishes are good as well. We ordered mac and cheese and cooked beans with meat and we were not disappointed at all. Try the tap beer …"
69,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I've only ordered delivery (been meaning to visit the restaurant) but this is probably the best BBQ I've ever tasted. Better than anything I had in NYC or LA. Infact, better than the BBQ I had in Texas once too. It's delicious."
70,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Incredibly tasty food, served quickly. Cocktails also amazing."
71,Pendergast, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great brisket, and delicious appetizers. Portions are a bit too big, if you ask me.. 🤭"
72,Pendergast, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I'm an American and I've got the meat sweats. Amazing food and great service. Get the brisket!
73,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I came here a couple of times and their American BBQ is one of the top ones in Amsterdam. This time around I ordered via deliveroo and I was doubtful of how fast and in what condition will I get it, based on my bad experiences with …"
74,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Speaking as an American expat living in Amsterdam: this place is legit. Mouth-watering brisket, great ribs. Better than many BBQ places I’ve eaten at in the U.S. The chef is from Kansas City, which explains the authenticity. …"
75,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Holy moly. Perhaps the best pulled pork I’ve ever eaten. There were crunchy little bits of pork like chicharrones that were PACKED with flavor. The cornbread was perfect too, but I love whole corn in my cornbread, so your mileage may vary. …"
76,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had a great meal here. The brisket was delicious and we also really enjoyed the mac and cheese side. All food was of high quality. The restaurant is intimate and cosy. Highly recommend this place for any meat lovers.
77,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've been multiple times and every time I've been blown away by how good the meat is. The brisket and the baby back ribs are by far the best I've had. The sides complement it perfectly and the lemon butter cake was so good I got a second slice. Favourite restaurant in Amsterdam.
78,Pendergast, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great calf ribs, great BBQ, great cocktails; shame they Updike a bottle of wine that was 2x as expensive..."
79,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Look, I usually don't have a great association with BBQ or anything related. But when we went to Pendergast for the birthday of a family member, I was pleasantly surprised. The brisket was my personal favourite. The food was very tender and …"
80,Pendergast, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Cocktails (while waiting) and takeaway were as perfect as ever. People were enjoying eat-in now restrictions are easing; I can't wait to spend an entire evening here.
81,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing food and wine. If you enjoy meat then you should come here. Cooked to perfection. Hard to go wrong but shout out to the brisket and the ribs. Also the starters are great.
82,Pendergast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious full of flavour melt in the mouth meat. The sharer was plenty for 3 greedy eaters to share and the menu offered something for all tastes. The staff were helpful, friendly and attentive. Unfortunately there was a very rowdy large …"
83,Pendergast, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I enjoyed the BBQ overall with the pork cheeks being the star of my plate. The black eyed peas were spot on. The ribs were so moist and juicy they were on the border of being too soft and the rub was fantastic. The mac and cheese was creamy …
84,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good Kansas City style bbq. Meat is very tender and tasty. We had the brisket and the spare ribs. Good size portions of both. Sides were good too, and reasonably sized. We had the potato salad and meaty beans. Amazing amount of meat in …"
85,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great Kansas Style BBQ in Amsterdam!
Nice food and nice people."
86,Pendergast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A delightful little restaurant!  A ride on the number 5 tram will take you right there, but don’t blink or you’ll miss it. …"
87,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Superb brisket. Really good cocktails - best Old Fashioned I've had in years. And very friendly - managed to squeeze us in at the bar even though they were booked out. Beetroot with liquorice was great.
88,Pendergast, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It was my first time eating there and the waitress explained to me the way the meat is smoked is like how they smoke meat in Kansas city. Having been in Kansas city myself and eaten there I had very high expectations. Once the meat …
89,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is simply amazing. An independent restaurant with warm friendly service. They actually make you feel that they are pleased you have come to eat there. And then there is the smoked food. The slow cooked beef brisket was amazing …
90,Pendergast, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Virginian here. I've traveled and lived in Europe for about three years total: this is by far the best and most authentic barbecue place on the continent that I have discovered. …
91,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Potato salad is amazing, for meat order the brisket! The pork cheek is a bit heavy on pepper but if you love pepper get it. Otherwise enjoy the juicy juicy brisket! :) and of course get the pecan pie, it’s all about the whipped cream :)"
92,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, slow cooked meat specials. I still haven't had anything that I wouldn't recommend."
93,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My intuition told me it would be tasty but I was not ready for the pleasant surprise. The girlfriend and I launched off from Canada and have been enjoying a Europe trip on our way through Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. I normally wouldn't …"
94,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Truly the best brisket I can get on this side of the Mississippi.

Literally my only complaint is that they don’t offer fried okra, but as someone …"
95,Pendergast, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Had a lovely meal here on the recommendation of a colleague. I had the Brisket with mashed potatoes and my girlfriend had the pulled pork with Mac and Cheese.
The waitress was friendly and explained the menu to us with the note about …"
96,Pendergast, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Enjoyed an early Sunday dinner at Pendergast, starting with a cocktail. Friendly, enthusiastic waiter who explained & advised us on the menu. We selected the 'share' option - consisting of 3 main course picks & sides of your choice. You …"
97,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent smoked BBQ brought to you by a wonderful cook/owner from Kansas City. The meat is super tender and tastes amazing. Don't expect regular food here (like grilled baby ribs), smoked BBQ is something completely different. I promise you, it will be a good experience!"
98,Pendergast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A busy and crowded place. Squeezing in at the bar is not for the faint of heart. Reservations are required. The meats and fish are smoked on site each day. That means there is a limited supply of each. I had the beef brisket and, WOW! I'm …"
99,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best barbecue in the country. I don't really eat meat much anymore, but gladly make an exception to visit this restaurant. Everything is excellent from the sides to the desserts to the 1950s styling of the place. One of the true gems in this city. Please don't ever change or disappear."
100,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food...as authentic American smoked meat as I’ve found. Brisket, beef rib (the day’s special) pork cheek, beans...all awesome. Pricey but worth it. The beer was great, too. It’s a small place, but a good vibe and fun. The service was great too. I will be back!"
101,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Delicious food, the brisket is just amazing!"
102,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The brisket and the pork cheek were just delicious, you can see (taste!) all the work and care that goes into it. Sides are also perfect, very good beer, looking forward to the next visit!"
103,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely deliciously slow cooked BBQ fare. Three of us shared ribs, brisket and pork neck alongside mac & cheese, potato salad and meaty BBQ beans. The meats were all wonderfully cooked, pulled apart nicely without too much chew and had a …"
104,Pendergast, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"After reading all the rave reviews we decided to give this place a shot.
We tried the brisket and honestly were a bit disappointed/ underwhelmed. It was ok but unfortunately not more. …"
105,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"You need to understand that this place makes some of the best bbq I have ever had. Coming from someone who is from Kansas (land of famous KC style bbq), this is a big deal. The smoked brisket, pork cheeks, and turkey are all impeccable. If …"
106,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is my second time here, this is the best smokehouse in Amsterdam! Great service too!"
107,Pendergast, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Ribs had only fat on them, vegetarian Seitan tasted awful and was inedible. Ended up throwing the meal away."
108,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Quite possibly the best barbecue I have ever had. The brisket was heavenly. It fell apart at the touch of your fork and the layer of fat on the edge of each piece melted in your mouth like pepper flavored honey. Out of this world...
109,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great barbecue (of course with a very small menu for the small space) that really makes me feel like I'm back in the States.  Definitely do a reservation ahead of time.  I was really pleased with the smoked brisket. If only they'd do beef ribs...
110,Pendergast, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Meat-lovers delight
If the thought of slow-cooked, Southern-style comfort food makes your mouth water, then reserve a table here, quick! While the interior is nothing to write home …"
111,Pendergast, 1 star ,a year ago,"Not sure where all these good ratings come from but my experience is that this place is a rip-off. 30€ for ribs that were nothing but fat, the smallest amount of meat I have ever seen on ribs for twice the price."
112,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Seriously great - I'm an American, came here on July 4th looking for some authentic bbq.  Really great food, cocktails, owner is a great guy from KC that knows his stuff"
113,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Judging by the dress code of the host, I would have expected to only get served potatoes, slaw and pasta ... Then, quickly, the contrast became stark as the quality of the bark gave the corner of my eye a little spark. Brisket to set a …"
114,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The most delicious bbq that I have ever tasted (until now). The bbq sauce was also addictive. I'd recommend to order the mixed dish with a bit of everything to taste as much as possible.
115,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Hard to come by a brisket place in Europe and surprisingly they do it excellent. Other meat we ordered were all great but brisket is the highlight. Very friendly staff is the bonus. Definetely recommend it..
116,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I am from Kansas City but have lived in Amsterdam for over three years now...and I can tell you that Pendergast is the Most Authentic BBQ restaurant in The Netherlands.  A little taste of home, down to each last drop of their delicious BBQ sauce.  Thanks guys!"
117,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food and service, and I liked the cocktails too!"
118,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic authentic Kansas slow smoked to perfection meat combined with perfect home made side dishes! Try the spread: oh so good. And the service is great and friendly!
119,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A restaurant that understands what matters! Very tasty food. great drinks and very friendly, authentic people. Best BBQ I ever had! Must do for everyone who likes meat."
120,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A bbq joint that focuses on food, not on being hip. Raises the bar for smoked meats to a whole new level (in the Netherlands). Small but considered beer collection and some really nice wines. Friendly chef from the heartland of US barbecue is always in for a chat. Small place and cozy little tables, tastefully decorated."
121,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The closest I have come to Austin/Texan style bbq outside of the region (I hear the owners represent Kansas city style so i hope I'm not starting a war). And a limited but informed collection of whiskey! This place will be trouble for my wallet.
122,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Pendergast is truly a gem in the west of Amsterdam. There are few restaurants in the Netherlands that do American cuisine well. Pendergast knocks Kansas City BBQ out of the park while still offering spectacular options for vegetarians. The meats are of high quality and the smoked seitan may be the best I've ever had.
123,Pendergast, 2 stars ,a year ago,"After so many positive reviews we with my wife were really disappointed with this place and this food. First of all, place itself was not cozy (cheap not comfortable tables and chairs). The guy that served us was very friendly and ready to …"
124,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ridiculously good food. The salmon was by far the best I've ever had and it wasn't even the best thing on the table, the brisket and the pulled pork where sublime, the pickled beets where delicious. I was moaning the whole time. I can't stop thinking about it, I might be in love."
125,Pendergast, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pretty decent food. Spareribs were good but really black on the outside. The two person portions were a bit smaller than we expected. Service is good too. Didn’t speak Dutch though.
126,Pendergast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous!! The closest to down-home-Southern cooking that you're going to find outside of the deep South in the US. Some of the best ribs and brisket I've ever eaten. The service was excellent and very friendly, too!"
127,Pendergast, 5 stars ,a year ago,The best barbecue food I’ve had in the Netherlands. The ribs are insane and the meaty beans are next level.
128,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Not cheapest or biggest portions but authentic smoked bbq in a cozy environment. Probably the best American style ribs I’ve had in NL. Nice neighborhood restaurant
129,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A cosy restaurant with good vibes, delectable foods and fine wine. We enjoyed the best smoked brisket and ribs with an array of delicious side dishes and pickled carrots. A must if you are visiting Amsterdam"
130,Pendergast, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazed how a cozy dinner spot in Amsterdam made me feel like I was back in the states eating with my family after a great bbq... Seriously, this place is it! Delicious meats, sides to die for and smiles from the staff makes it one of the best places in town!"
131,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I've been twice now and waited to review until I knew it wasn't just a fluke the food was awesome in the first time I went.  This place is great. It's hard to get a table unless you go early. But it's worth the effort for sure.
132,Pendergast, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Meat was great!
Only thing which stopped this place getting 5 stars was because the food is prepared very early (most things are slow cooked, and started long before you get …"
133,Pendergast, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Delicious food made with passion. Staff is very friendly and helpfull. Eighter if you're a carnivore, vegetarian or vegan you'll find some nice items on the menu. I really enjoyed the seitan, kale and black eyed peas. They also do cocktails and high end whiskeys!"
134,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, wish I had ordered the platter of three dishes. Had the ribs and tasted some of the brisket. Real bbq flavors,  and meat comes right of the bone."
135,Pendergast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place is not for the lighthearted... everything they cook is slow cooked and it has an overwhelming bbq/smoke taste. I am looking forward to having an excuse to eat here again as soon as possible. Great service and good price for the great quality you get.

140,Pendergast, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favorite restaurant in Amsterdam. There is no one who does smoking and slow cooking as this guy does. He is skilled and extremely passionate about what he does, and judging from the food, he knows what he is doing! He would happily show you around the kitchen and let you meet the big smoker."

It's delicious and the service is really nice. Amazing little restaurant!"
