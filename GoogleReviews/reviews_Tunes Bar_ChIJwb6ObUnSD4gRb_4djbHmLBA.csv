0,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"What a fun pub!!! Friendly and funny employees,  super cool vibe, all the beers and liquors one person could need. Shuffle board and billiards! The chicken tenders and onion rings are delish!"
1,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I have been going to Toons for a very long time. This is some of the best bar food in the city. The smoked meats, the burgers, the wings are all great. They have daily food specials. There is a definitely a Cajun/New Orleans/Louisiana ‚Ä¶"
2,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Super friendly staff with good alternative music in the background but not so loud that you cannot converse with those around you. The front is a bar and the back room has the standard bar games including darts and shuffleboard.
3,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"I went to Toons today. After many months I have finally tried it. One of the best bartenders I have ever had came around: he was knowledgeable, funny, and personable. His name was Ben, and he took no sh*t. He was pressed by a very invalid ‚Ä¶"
4,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Difficult to park. Washroom area needs some loving. Dirt, mold, smelly area near the washrooms and inside the washrooms. Service was nice. Ribs were yummy. Reasonable prices."
5,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Stopped in night with the family for dinner after Zoo Lights. Great meal. The wings, burgers and pulled turkey were on point. The only downside is the music volume. Get it if it is crowded, but it was pretty empty, made it hard to have a ‚Ä¶"
6,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Great neighborhood pub with a decent beer selection, regular drink specials and a really good food menu. Some standards but also some unique dishes. A fun place to hang with friends."
7,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A casual and delightful atmosphere with room for escalating parties. Shuffleboard table, billiards, and arcade games.  Friendly staff and  good atmosphere for most types of conversation and revelry. Prices are fair and selection is ‚Ä¶"
8,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"üòä Tbh love the drinks, friendly/helpful staff, have even picked up their food carryout--just, must be some kind of curse, rendezvous at this convenient & tasty *nearby* neighborhood dive bar/grill  never gets me a second dateüòèüíî"
9,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Watched a Chiefs game here. If you're a Chiefs fan, this is the place to be on game day. Service was great, food was good, solid beer selection and the atmosphere during a game is awesome."
10,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Matt recommended the Ranch Water seltzer. So impressed and will always trust his opinion now. Best seltzer ever and don't know anywhere else that serves it.
11,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"I kind of want to keep this local to myself. But, it is a great example of a Chicago neighborhood bar. Get wings."
12,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Staff are very friendly and accomodating! Beer prices are reasonable, although selection is average, but bar food portion sizes are quite good! The bar seats are not the most comfortable for everyone. Accessibility from the south side ‚Ä¶"
13,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Awesome Kansas City Chiefs bar in the heart of Chicago. Get there early if you are from out of town to watch the chiefs game!
14,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I've been going to Toons for years since I work nearby. Toons is a great local neighborhood bar and grill with really good food especially for a bar, it's semi-kid friendly meaning although it's a bar families frequently go here and kids ‚Ä¶"
15,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Got the Wednesday burger special and will definitely be back for more. Had a fantastic beer menu as well! Tip: try the Chile habanero sauce if your a pepperhead.

18,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Toons is a neighborhood Chicago bar with exceptional food and drink. Fine dining bar food at a reasonable price. And  a beer selection that will complement whatever you order to eat. My compliments to the owner and wait staff!
19,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly and attentive staff, excellent food (personal fav is the Cubano, but never HD anything bad). Great local that also caters to Cubs pre/post-game, KC Chiefs, Blackhawks, and I'm sure others I don't know. Refer to first line. :)"
20,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great atmosphere, service is awesome. The bar tender Claire is awesome!"
21,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Great place. Service is always friendly and knowledgeable. Nice menu on food and beer. I do my own bbq so...that means mine is better than everyone's..that said. They do a good job and I would and do order it. Currently looks like the back ‚Ä¶

23,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Wow, great to see this is still a neighborhood tavern. My first time there was 1967 with my grandparents. All German back in the day. Don't quite remember the name back then, was definitely German though. Looks as though they are doing very well, glad to see it!"
24,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Friendliest bar on the neighborhood!! Super chill place (unless the chiefs win the Super bowl then it turns up!). Wings are great! Can‚Äôt go wrong here!
25,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Friendly, attentive staff. Not over crowded on Cub game days. Very good food and fair beer prices. Easy 10 min walk to Wrigley."
26,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great draft beer selection and plenty of bar food to choose from!
27,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Always great. Nice happy crowd. Great food. Great staff.
28,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love this bar! The best bar food you will find in Chicago. Big fan of their homemade burgers, fries and soups! Buffalo chicken tenders are addicting and service is always on point. Thanks for doing it up right!"
29,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We go here all the time on Mondays for half price wings. It‚Äôs a great deal and all the apps are half off. They also do $3.50 pbr tall boys and it‚Äôs become our Monday tradition. Love the garlic buffalo sauce and their onion rings are ‚Ä¶
30,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Watched England lose here. Great atmosphere (despite the couple of Italian tables). The bar girl was a legend.
31,Tunes Bar, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Food is good here but the atmosphere is blah. They also will not allow registered service dogs, despite paperwork provided. Not that friendly of a place, would not recommend."
32,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is one of my favorite local spots in the city. Great for Cubs fans and KC fans. They have shuffle board, darts and pool. They have a great beer selection and the best in house pineapple shots around. You can't go wrong with this place any day of the week."
33,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Crawfish Boils are the best. Must try the pineapple shots too
34,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Cozy neighborhood pub. Great wings, nice servers"
35,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Just a great, chill place with no pretension and friendly hosts."
36,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The bar was loud inside (not a complaint, just the way it was) so we sat outside with our group to eat and have a few beers. ‚Ä¶"
37,Tunes Bar, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Well, can‚Äôt speak for actually going in, but some guy was putting up chairs outside when we were riding by and asked us ‚Äúwhy are you staring at me?‚Äù  Kinda creep."
38,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love Toons! This place has been a neighborhood staple since I moved to Chicago. The at home feel plus an amazing staff makes you not want to leave. I love coming here anytime of year. This is a great place to catch a Cubs game if you ‚Ä¶
39,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Toons is my first stop in Wrigleyville. You cannot find a better burger than the KC Special. Grab a shot of pineapple vodka!
40,Tunes Bar, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Toons ""is what it is"".  Kind if divey.  Fun with friends, but keep the order simple.  Not the place to go for a cocktail, stick w/  a name Brand or classic (i.e. Whiskey and Coke) and you'll be fine."
41,Tunes Bar, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The place has cool stuff but is definitely worn down. It's time to replace the floors at least. The typical bar food is cheap and packaged, which isn't bad, just not my thing for I like a little home cooking type of foods. The staff is nice ‚Ä¶"
42,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is outstanding. Much better than the average Tavern fare. The price point is extremely reasonable, daily specials for food and booze. All the employees are really nice except one waitress dark hair, sort of thick. The owner and the other patrons are fantastic."

44,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best neighborhood bar in the city hands down. The staff is awesome, the food is great and is always a great spot to watch sports! If you are in the area and looking for a good low-key spot this is the place."
45,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a medium-sized bar with great staff and excellent customer service. They have dine in deals just like half priced appetizers on Mondays. Gets packed on weekends and game nights (football, baseball). I love it there. I had my first legal alcohol beverage there. It's home."
46,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great time here! The food was good and the service was great even when they were busy for the game.
47,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Recommended by a friend. Was not disappointed. The sandwich and beer selection/recommendations were fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed interacting with Ben the bartender. He gives good hugs.
48,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,The service could be better but the drinks are reasonably priced.  They have specials every night of the week and free darts in the back.  They also play a ride variety of music at this bar.  Everything from 80's pop to modern alternative to hip hop.  I have not tried the food here but from what I've seen the dishes look pretty tasty.
49,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,$5 Burger special today normally it is 9. The burger was very good. Their menu is not huge but it covers a number of dietary taste. They have salads they have sandwiches they have Burgers they have wraps and even some vegan options as well. ‚Ä¶
50,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Good food and very friendly service.  Rich and AG are great!!
51,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Toons is a great place to get a quick bite of American bar food. My boyfriend and I always go on Mondays for half off appetizers and the waitress that works that night provides great service. Definitely recommend the buffalo chicken strips!
52,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I went to Toons for the first time last night and as a Chiefs fan I can tell you there is no better bar in the city to watch a KC game. Food is damn good and the bartenders are quick, friendly, and accommodating. Oh and they have Dovetail lager on tap! Thank you!"
53,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Nice local spot food is great the staff is friendly and you have a good time with Chicago Cubs fans.
54,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Great place. Wish they had a larger patio. Don't forget to try their food ... fantastic.
55,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Fun neighborhood bar. Decent BBQ and good drink prices. Friendly staff and relatively chill patrons. There is a shuffleboard that takes four quarters and one pool table.
56,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Toons is my favorite bar in all of Chicago. Exceptionally good energy, friendly staff, amazing food. My Happy place 10/10"
57,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great wings and fun trivia night!
58,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Authentic neighborhood bar that hasn't lost its soul to commercial Wrigleyville. I wasn't very hungry and had only a bowl of chili (good!) but everyone in our party was happy with their food and drinks. Prices were very fair considering the location.
59,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome chiefs bar.  Food was really good.  Service was A+
60,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Toons is a great little neighborhood bar. They have pool and shuffleboard in the back. The bartenders are all really awesome, and they treat their regulars really well. On a weekend or after a Cubs game, it might be full of rowdy people, but otherwise it's really relaxed."
61,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I didn't become a man until I experienced Toons. The music, beer, and wait staff really makes you feel like you're at home in your living room. I never thought that beer and a bar would make me feel cozy like Toons. I want to personally thank everyone there for my man hood and the geniune service."
62,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Maybe I'm being a little biased because I am a native Kansas citian and Chiefs fan but what an awesome cozy little bar. Tommy was an excellent bartender and I was greeted with a handshake before I even sat down at the bar...wish we had this bar in Kansas City
63,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good daily specials, good prices, and the black and blue burger is delightful. Get there quickly on NCAA football days if you want to sit outside as patio space is limited, but it's pretty available the rest of the year!"
64,Tunes Bar, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Was there on 9/5/21. Worst service ever. Had to wait 15 minutes just to pay after awful service. One bartender was super wasted. Only bad service here twice and tonight may have ended my patronage here
65,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love Toon""s!!! Atmosphere is warm and friendly. Rich is the best. By far the best food I have had in a long time. It's always consistent. I've had ribs,wings,burger, the catfish po' boy and the beer batter onion rings. Everything is soooo good! Best on the northside for sure!!"
66,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved the signature drinks, but we were surprised to see the drinks were full priced even though they were advertised as half off on Mondays.  Karaoke was a great time, but the waitstaff could have been friendlier."
67,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I really like the wings at this location. The Buffalo and Korean are the best. Drinks are tasty and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is friendly I don't frequent bars often but the food and drinks and atmosphere is really nice.
68,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My home away from home. Great food, friendly staff, cool atmosphere!"
69,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cool spot that's open late. Great beers and drinks that are priced well. Away from the craziness of Clark St in Wrigleyville which makes this spot ideal to just hang out and be able to make conversation with friends without loud blaring music.
70,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Toons is one of my favorite spots. As a fan of 'dive' bars, this place lives up to it. Great, and cheap night of fun. Bar has a pool table, shuffle board, and great drinks. Will always hit this place up when I'm in Chicago."
71,Tunes Bar, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We came here few times and it was fine.  We stopped in for a drink after the Cubs parade and took 15 minutes to get the attention of the bartender.. yes, I know they were super busy so we totally understand that.. BUT then the waiters and ‚Ä¶"
72,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"All the makings of a solid/great neighborhood bar. Pool table, table shuffleboard, varied beer selection, and cheap food specials. The servers have a lot of personality and do a great job"
73,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great divey bar in a great Hood.   Their BBQ is top notch, as is all of their food - gotta have the wings! Pretty solid beer selection,  but not if you're a hipster beer cicerone wanna be (if you know what a cicerone is, you might be ‚Ä¶"
74,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best Chiefs Bar in the city! Its like home.

76,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of our favorite bars in the neighborhood! Great food and drink specials and nice people working there. Can't recommend enough.
77,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good beer selection with decent prices. Enough TVs. Food was hit or miss, some great, some not. Chicken tenders only had 3 small tenders."

79,Tunes Bar, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"I have never hated a bar more than I hated Toons. They only get the second star because, as I recall, they had a shuffleboard table in the back and this reviewer happens to love tabletop shuffleboard. Anyway, back to the hatred: I have ‚Ä¶"
80,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice local sports bar ambiance in the City.  The bathroom was much nicer than I expected, somewhere around a 6 on a ten point scale. Friendly staff. Fair pricing."
81,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just the best friendly neighborhood spot. Great daily specials and AJ is the best bartender.  Love to come here for a game of pool, wings, po boys and good beer selection."
82,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,8 years ago,Great place to go to watch some football.  This is a Chiefs bar and I feel at home on Sundays here.  I can even forgive the fact that it is also a Jayhawks Bar.  (M-I-Z-Z-O-U!!)  On Sunday that doesn't matter. ‚Ä¶
83,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice but small outside seating. Standard fare menu and drink selections. Attentive service. Half price burger on Wednesdays and other specials the rest of the week.
84,Tunes Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I had a major craving for a burger the week i ordered takeout from here. It was my first time ever being here despite it being no more than an 8 min walk home....the burger i had imagined in my head was juicy with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, ‚Ä¶"
85,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down one of my favorite places in the city. Friendly staff, good food, excellent drink selection, and pool, shuffleboard, and darts in the backroom. The perfect place to relax with some friends."
86,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great prices, has a great combo of food, games and drinks
Pool table (Can't recall if $1 or $1.50), darts (free) and another game I'm unsure of as I don't play it. Also has a safari hunting arcade game.
Note that the kitchen closes at 11pm"
87,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The menu and service were beyond our expectations. I really liked the environment of this spot. Awesome place to take my family out for dinner.
88,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Not a bad Kansas CIty bar on Southport in the Lakeview area. Decent beer selection. The onion ring platter is enough to serve 4 people. Check it out!
89,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Amazing Chiefs bar!

92,Tunes Bar, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Food was cold. Took 15 minutes to get a soda... and we were sitting next to the bar. Obnoxious jerks everywhere, laughing and jeering at people coming in with Santa hats on... three days before Christmas!! If you are a douche, jerk or one ‚Ä¶"
93,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is just a fantastic neighborhood dive bar. Great deals every day. Friendly and helpful staff. Pool, darts, shuffleboard, and virtual golf. Great spot."

101,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best ""traditional style"" wings in the city.  Buff Joes is the best in the Chicagoland area but toons takes the cake for downtown.  Birds Nest is good too but Toons has the most authentic buffalo flavor."

106,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Thursday's special is $4 for a 6-piece of wings (regularly $7) we ordered and the wings came out in 5 minutes fresh, hot and juicy!!"
107,Tunes Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,Not a real Chiefs bar if you're wondering. Won't even invest in an NFL package to get preseason games and won't try to get the games. This place is a fraud.
108,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great neighborhood bar. Always have good drink specials and the food is great.
109,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really fun bar, always packed on the weekends, but I always end up having a good time here. Pretty good prices as well!"

115,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A fun local spot. It's not really close to the action was far as the bars adjacent to Wrigley Field are concerned, but if you follow some of the locals, you'll find it."
116,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great bar to stop by at before a show at The Music Box or a game at Wrigley. Definitely get the Buffalo wings.
117,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favorites in Lakeview. Shuffleboard, pool, and always a really fun atmosphere. I've never had a bad time here."

148,Tunes Bar, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good place to enjoy bar food and catch a ball game, but could use more seating."
149,Tunes Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love this place. Neighborhood feel to it that is now starting to lack on the Southport Corridor. Plus they have shuffle board!
