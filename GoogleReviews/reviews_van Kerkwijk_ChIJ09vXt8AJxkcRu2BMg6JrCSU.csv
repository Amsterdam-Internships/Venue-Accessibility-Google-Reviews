0,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,This is a gem of a restaurant. We found it on our second last day & what a great discovery it was. We had lunch here on 2 consecutive days. The food was delicious. The service was slow-ish because the food was cooked from scratch. It's a no …

2,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Totally deserving its punctuation (4.6), this restaurant is the best experience we had in the city centre over 4 days. The restaurant is cute, the waitress is super fun, and there is no menu, which means very targeted quality homemade …"

4,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I was really looking forward to visiting this restaurant after reading the reviews. I was a bit hopeless as it was Saturday night (with an 8pm lockdown) and I had no bookings. When arrived at the restaurant it only had one table free and …
5,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,a week ago,I ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and Indonesian chicken which was little less spicy (to my taste being an Indian). Overall a good place to eat.
6,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Best experience in Amsterdam. The owner was so kind to us and explained all the menu. They gave us a traditional lollipop that I think is a must try... But I'll never try again hahaha
7,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We often found ourselves dining at the many cafes along Amsterdam’s waterways to enjoy the views. We were however pleasantly surprised to find a culinary treat just off the waterways at Van Kerkwijk.  With no written menu, our server …"

12,van Kerkwijk, 3 stars ,a week ago,"I have to say if it was two years ago, I would have rated this place +5 stars. But unfortunately the quality has downgraded after corona time. We ordered the popular and famous beef steak in strawberry sauce, the meat was a very low …"
13,van Kerkwijk, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"There was no menu, the waitress said she would tell us what they offer. In what restaurant you have no access to the menu?
Then she refused to tell us what's on the menu before ordering drinks. One of us …"
14,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I m putting four stars beacause when we ordered the meat loaf the waiter never asked us how we want our meat cooked and the strawberry sauce was very weak, there was no menu the waiter had to explain all the dishes. However the place was …"
15,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"This place was so good- I've seen it before and I should have stopped. This time I had a recommendation from a local and it really paid off. Very friendly staff, amazing food, decent prices. I can't wait to go back."

The restaurant lies on a street hidden in the old town city center of Amsterdam …"

We went there every day of our trip and we will def be back next time we are in town. Totally recommend!"
22,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely unreal food. Went by other Google reviews and wasn't disappointed. My wife was blown away by the Indonesian beef and I thought the fish salad was unreal - fresh, full of unique flavour and just the right portion sizes. Would highly recommend!"
23,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,a year ago,The place has a very rustic feel to it and a very authentic decoration. The desert was amazing. The portions are very large. Also they do not have a hand held menu but instead you will be listed the specials of the day by the wait staff. Would definitely recommend.
24,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Our top go-to place for delicious food. Its busy every time but the service and quality is stupendous.
The fun starts with the menu being orally announced once you are seated, the …"
25,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was great, we came when there were no free spaces to sit, but we're offered to wait a bit at the bar what we did. The atmosphere is very lively and friendly. The stuff was very welcoming. When it came to choosing food, the …"

28,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Total gem just off of dam square. No reservations and it does get busy, there is a bar area to drink while waiting that got quite cozy. No menu either the friendly team recited the menu table side. With fresh seasonal ingredients this gives …"
29,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really cozy small restaurant with amazing food. Price is normal, plates are huge. Bonus is the really cool waiter that will entertain you and make you feel great. I recommend the pork sandwich, the meat just melts in your mouth. Amazing place!"
30,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I was with a small group of very picky eaters who couldn't decide what to eat. We finally decided on this place despite knowing very little about it because it was close by.This turned out to be the nicest meal I've had in a long time. …
31,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This restaurant is a must on your visit to Amsterdam. The staff are happy and relax and sublime. The food is tasty, well presented and really reasonable.

32,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was quite an awesome experience. The staffs are really friendly and the food there is incredibly delicious. It is definitely worth to visit and for the price. I ordered the mussels, duck breast and grandma's pie. All of them are really tasty. I am definitely looking forward to visiting there again soon."
33,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I have to be honest when I say that anytime suggests a “grilled vegetable sandwich” to me as a vegetarian, I’m always cautious because I hate limp soggy grilled veggies. I have to say that van Kerkwijk cafe pleasantly surprised with …"
34,van Kerkwijk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Mussels were amazing. The mains were decent. Service was okay. Other tables were being served quicker and were given what looked like tap water although when we asked we were brusquely told they do not serve tap water.
35,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Cute little restaurant. There is a no written menu because there are new dishes everyday - so bring your short-term memory because the waitress will tell the options to you ;) There are many tasty options though - I had a goat cheese salad …
36,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My girlfriend and I decided to visit this place on a whim just after seeing it online. WOW. We were not disappointed. On arrival there was not a table free as it is quite a cosy place to eat so we were directed towards the bar. After about …
37,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Elegant and delicious. For starters we enjoyed the pastrami carpaccio and the mussells were divine. We ordered the Cod along with a Beef tenderloin with goats cheese and raspberry compote.   The dessert was fine... Not great... But an amaretto cheesecake.  Service was excellent.  As a guest in Amsterdam this was a true welcome mat.
38,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Super fresh and homemade food, nice lunch choice and very friendly Service."
39,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The restaurant doesn't have a menu, probably because the menu change often, and it was a bit challenging to follow the waitress explaining the options. I decided to just ask for her recommendation for a lunch meal, and was served a great …"
40,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great and lovely place! Meals are cooked from fresh products and you can feel it! Once at your table, you're greeted by the owner who declines the menu according to the products available this day. Food takes a while to get served, but worth the wait. Highly recommend!"
41,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is amazing  and the service is pretty good. Interesting part they don't have menu.. get recommendations!
42,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little restaurant, I found it by accident trying to escape the rain. I liked the idea of no menu, and no price. The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable, the wine was good and the food was even better. I had the mussels to start and the filet of beef with strawberry sauce. I would definitely visit again."
43,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Quite possibly one of the best meals I've ever had without breaking the bank. It's converted me to the idea I should pour my money into dinner rather than brunch because the meat was that damn good. I had pate, duck, and cheesecake. The fries which come with each meal are great too!"
44,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Came across this somewhat hidden Gem! I have nothing but positive feedback. after accidently stealing someone else's table, the staff didn't make a big deal and allowed us to stay sitting. They had a predetermined menu to choose from. Who …"
45,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing!! I had the Indonesian chicken and it was to die for. Their house made mayonnaise is the best thing I've tasted in a while. Highly recommend this place. They don't even have a menu, a guy named Carlo came and told us everything. A …"
46,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I ate here THREE times during my visit to Amsterdam it was that delicious. It is a smaller establishment, so if you do not want to wait for a table arrive before 6pm or be prepared to wait.  The menu changes and is not in paper form, a …"
47,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Just my kind of place when I’m touring abroad: small, simple, cozy, charming, centrally located yet a little bit hidden. Locals meet tourists yet NOT a tourist trap. He runs the kitchen, she runs the saloon. There’s no written menu, she …"
48,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice good looking service personnel, a bonus! No menu, order off the recommendation, comfy salad with pork tartar. Easy price too"
49,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Could not fault this excellent ""back Street"" cafe, and I use that word loosely as this is a grown up restaurant. Mackrel mouse, beef in strawberry sauce and apple walnut tart was all delicious. Great service too, no menu the waitress will talk you through it. Delightful."
50,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food was very good. We were a little worried about the check because there is no written menu. At the end it was as we expected. The attention was very nice too
51,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"You're gonna get fine dining food at regular restaurant prices here. This charming location has a quality selection of drinks to start. The menu is recited by heart, which is cute at first but ultimately annoying when you want to make an …"
52,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the best time! We waited a while for a table and they picked out some apps for us. The beer was fantastic, the wine was great, the service was delightful and the food was amazing. …"
53,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"So happy I followed the reviews and came here. It doesn't disappoint. I was just expecting a meat loaf sandwich for the main, but instead it was a lovely portion of meatloaf, side of salad and a side of fries. All up it was €21.25 much better than some other places prices"
54,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I honestly was a bit apprehensive of going here as it was quite small and looked like only local people were inside. I could have not been more wrong. The waiter (who I think might be the owner too) was amazing and definitely set the …
55,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great concept and vibe for a restaurant! Very busy spot with Excellent food selection. The steak with goat cheese and strawberry sauce was perfect. My friends chicken dish was also quite good
56,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The good thing about this restaurant is that they serve you like at home, and the food is great and worth the price. The bad thing is that u must drink here and the steak is really not that special as acclaimed."
57,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is the most excited I've been writing a review.
Yes, it's a small restaurant with two staff front of house and one chef but if you're on holiday there's no need to be in a rush. It's about 30min wait for a …"
58,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"There are no printed menus, instead the waitstaff impressively recite the day's offerings to each patron from memory. I ordered the warm goat cheese salad and it was perfect. The sweet warm tartness of the cheese and honey complemented the crisp vegetables perfectly. Good coffee as well served with a minature biscotti."
59,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,They don't have a written menu so I guess it changes a lot which is nice. The food was really superb. Simple and tasty.

64,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,No menu but trust what they suggest. The three different types of seafood we ordered were all fantastic. …
65,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The only restaurant with the kitchen open after 9pm around my hotel... The steak with goat cheese and strawberry sauce was divine!

69,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It's a restaurant a little different. The food is very good and the flavours of the ingredients combine perfectly. Recommendable.

73,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great food, staff and location, thanks."
74,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"If you are into sea food you should give it a try. The menu has some non-sea-food options but again, this is where sea food shall be eaten by far. A bit small place. The service wa kind and quite quick with - around 10 minutes of waiting for my meal while almost every table was busy."
75,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place without menu. Waiter tell u about their dishes position at this time. We can choose dinner from 6 dishes. It’s really tasty. The price is common. Recommend.

Quiet expensive but the soup is nice"
129,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars, is because they were short staffed. We had to wait a while for our table, even though tables were empty. Not the guys working fault,  but this is an honest review.  Considering the short …"

137,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful cafe restaurant hidden away in a backstreet. No written menu, but recited to you by a waiter who comes and sits at your table to go through what is available that day. Most unexpected!  Food is excellent quality and good value; …"
138,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such a nice place! We went here after my girlfriend had an equally amazing experience here on a previous occasion. We took guests with us this time. The interior is very cosy and warm (especially good on a cold day!) the menu is unusual in …
139,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cannot rate this place highly enough. Sharing starter was a perfect start to the meal, followed by an amazingly cooked fillet steak with goats cheese and strawberry compote. Topped off with the best brownie I've ever eaten. Washed down with …"
140,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food and great wait staff. Waiter had excellent beer serving skills and it was chilled to perfection. While the waitress explained the menu perfectly and kept me well topped up with extra beer. Great job all involved, it was a team effort in the end but we got there!"
141,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had the famous dish and it exceeded my expectations by far!
Highly recommended to a anyone planning to visit to Amsterdam"
142,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We found this vibrant restaurant close to the shopping center. It was very busy and we had to wait quite a bit but the wait was well worth it! We got coffee while waiting and it was soo creamy and delicious! The menu is chef's choice so we …
143,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Everything was fantastic. Dessert was what stood out to me. Apple and Pear pies were the best I have had. They have limited choices as they do not use a normal menu, but everything was delicious and reasonably priced. The beef with strawberry sauce and goat cheese was a favorite."
144,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"An absolute pleasure to have dined here.

The service was great, and the food blew us away. I had the steak with goat …"
145,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent. Don't be scared off by the small space and less traveled location down alley. Food is great and environment relaxing. Steak with goat cheese and strawberry sauce is amazing. Dessert is probably better had elsewhere. They are homemade, but the apple pie I tried was mediocre."
146,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The menu changes daily, but their nice staff will explain the menu to you. Their only  ever present item on the menu is the steak served on soft cheese and strawberry sauce - and that is to die for.  Other food we've had was also delicious. Recommended the restaurant to a few friends already, and we were there literally 15 minutes ago."
147,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Quite an experience. They don't have a menu on paper. There's someone that comes to offer the drinks and someone that comes to explain the menu, both super friendly. You choose from the the options, you can ask questions about the dish, ask …"
148,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent service!! The waitresses were organized and took note of every need, and had the whole menu off by heart. Very good food too! We had a full meal with desert and everything was excellent. We saw a review saying that prices were …"

With great service and homey delicious food!"
150,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing restaurant. No written menu but the lady who owns and works at the place will tell you what the specials of the day are. Amazing food! Everything was fresh and tasty! On top of all that the staff was very friendly and attentive. If your in the area looking for something to eat I would 100% recommend to go here.
151,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic spot. On a small side street very near the main Dam square. Very friendly service. Many changes daily- they just tell you what the options are. My tomato soup was sublime, and the house meatloaf sandwich was fantastic."
152,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delightful place.  We stumbled across this place our first night in Amsterdam. The meal and evening were one our best dining experiences this year.  The staff waswondeeful and the food divine.  Raved about it to all my Dutch friends the rest of the week.
153,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Super friendly staff,  cold beer,  and good eats.  What more could you ask for?"
154,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We went to this restaurant on our first night in Amsterdam, and went back again the following night. With no written menu, the wait staff approached each table to explain the day's meal options. This was a lot of fun. The staff really knew …"

156,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I was in Dam square and was hungry, and randomly ended up finding this place. The service is extremely friendly and attentive, and the style of the restaurant is very interesting (the menu changes daily, so one of the servers lists off the …"
157,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice and cozy small restaurant just a block away from the huge mess of the Dam, it saved our day. They only have a few dishes with what's fresh that day, a very friendly service and good quality food, with a focus on Dutch dishes of course. Absolutely recommended."
158,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This was such a neat restaurant with a limited amount of tables, so we had to wait awhile for a table to open up.  It was well worth the wait!  No menus, the waitress just came to the table and told what the specials for the day were.  I …"
159,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food! The concept of the restaurant is quite interesting. You'll probably need to wait for a table, since it's usually crowded, but the wait is definitely worth it! (Also, you can wait in a small table outside while having some nice …"
160,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The title sums it up. Van Kerkwijk is a Amsterdam gem. The lack of menu made me apprehensive but the staff are knowledgable, friendly, and run you through it all. …"
161,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful experience. Came here for lunch after visiting the royal residence. Vegetarian options galore. Server (maybe owner) had a warm disposition and recited the menu. Just a few options, which speaks to the quality of each item and lessens the decision fatigue. We shared a soup, salad and sandwich with two beers for 35 euros."
162,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My friend and I got into a table of two after arriving in Amsterdam in the evening for the first time. We got friendly service and a wait that was reasonable given that the restaurant is packed. Really tasty dishes with salad and fries to share between two. Got the breaded fish dish and it was great.
163,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cozy restaurant in a less crowded street. No menu and no prices. The waiters explains the menu in excellent English but it's still hard to choose between five different main courses when you don't see them before you. The food is really …
164,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food. Great staff. I got there around 3 pm. They didn't have the menu but they offered 4 salads and soups. I ordered pasta salad and it came with a garden salad on the side for 15 euros. I found the price reasonable.
165,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The service was fantastic, food is fresh tasting. I had the pork pate salad and wasn't disappointed even if a pate salad is an odd combination. Drink selection is varied. Would definitely eat here again."
166,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best food we ate in Amsterdam by far. The waiter was lovely, and went through the menu in detail. Soups were incredible and our mains were great as well. Very cheap for the quality of food and customer service, couldn't have wanted more!"
167,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"As a local, it is hard to impress me at restaurants since we have been to so many and obviously have our biased favorites. It is especially hard to impress me as we get closer to the center of the city. But WOW was I impressed last night. …"
168,van Kerkwijk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Although the food is ok, it is a little bit unusual that you don't know how much you will pay until you receive the cheque. There is no menu available, one of waiters comes to the table and recites the menu for you. As far as I understood, …"
169,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A lovely restaurant that had the best combination of character, well cooked food, and knowledgeable and friendly staff. We shared (two of us) a starter, then had a main and dessert and drink each and paid about £30, which for the quality of …"

We went Friday night and we have to wait almost an hour to get a table.
Then we were rewarded with very good and tasty meal.
Highly recommended."
172,van Kerkwijk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Extremely rude and low class waitress working at this restaurant , while presenting the menu in a very cold tone, she pointed out why one of us are checking our mobile. We were shocked by her behavior and asked her to calm down She asked us …"
173,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Don't come hungry, they take a while to serve you, but the food and the atmosphere is fantastic. Really really great staff and there is no menu  to read, you just wait for one of the waiters to come to your table to tell you what's on offer for the day. I would still recommend though"
174,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered a tomato soup, pate salad and goat cheese sandwich. Fantastic food. Everything has the right flavor, and the sandwich has a generous cut of goat cheese. Like it! …"
175,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 months ago,One of my favourite places in Amsterdam! Always a fantastic experience! 👏
176,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I was really happy. The service, the location. Not to many people, not too crowded, good vibes. There's no menu, the menu is told by the server, which really makes the customer in focus. 2 starters, 2 mains, 2 whisky/Coke, 2 glasses of white wine = 77 euros. Money well spend. Will come back soon."
177,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I came here before visiting the Anne Frank House, it was far away enough from tourism spots to be a more quiet, relaxed atmosphere. Their menu isn't posted, so you have to listen  until you hear something you like while the waitress goes …"
178,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My friend and I had lunch at van Kerkwijk today, and it was a wonderful experience as we started our trip in Amsterdam. The host greeted us warmly and patiently helped my friend choose from their daily menu. I had a fish salad (salmon, …"

181,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food.  They opened late for us.  I highly recommend the Indonesian Chicken its ver tasty.  Also mussels are great.  Its in the “new” area of the city, away from all the pot smokers and sex shops."
182,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"What a wonderful place! The staff were so friendly and the food absolutely delicious. I tried something new: beef with strawberry sauce. I also got the fish pate, cheesecake, and a nice light wine. Would definitely come back!"
183,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Local gem in a touristy area. Food was great and the service was really friendly as well. I enjoyed that the lunch menu was verbal and that you'll be getting it the way they want to prepare it. Don't go here if you think you'll have a problem with that.
184,van Kerkwijk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Dont know why this place is so highly rated  on Google. Did not  like the fact that there was  no menu. They could have charged me what they liked. Had the strawberry steak and felt that it was a average. Cooked medium rare not that I was asked. The steak was not that tender but guess this is what you get for 20+ Euro in Amsterdam.
185,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely place, very nice and friendly owner. Food was delicious. Portions of a main coerce are very big. We ordered starters and main dishes and couldn't finish. They had to pack our food to go. In the restaurant they didn't have a paper …"
186,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic food, super relaxed atmosphere and really friendly staff. Yes you cannot check out menu online first or read even because they can just recite the choices to you. However it doesn’t matter because the food is excellent!"
187,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Superb service, excellent fresh food and cosy ambience. Given that we walked in soon after kitchen had closed and after being turned down by other places in the area, we appreciated the exquisite platter of delicious food even more. If we could, we'd given them 6 stars without a second thought."
188,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is amazing. Worth the wait. If you are in Amsterdam you must treat yourself and enjoy. The place is small and packed full of charm and atmosphere. The food is simply delicious and every bite is a gift. I am so happy I ate here tonight. If and when I am in Amsterdam again I will be stopping by. A meal I will not forget!!!!
189,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Our waitress Fleur had such a great personality it was a great introduction to beautiful food.  The fillet steak on Goats Cheese was scrumptious although I don’t eat goats cheese and had ordered sirloin.  Don’t let this put you off though.  A great venue and great food.
190,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favourite dining experience in Amsterdam, you will not regret a meal here. Intimate friendly crowd in a relaxed setting. Staff are polite, happy and attentive. There is no menu so upon being placed you will be told the meal options, 3-4 …"
191,van Kerkwijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Tasty beer and the food was quite good. But the service was very slow. We had to wait a long time for the waitress to come and tell us about the menu. There was no printed menu, only the verbal one. And after that there was a long wait for …"
192,van Kerkwijk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Disappointing. We got the bread and three dips (smoked mackerel, blue cheese, and pork pate), salmon with asian-style sauce, cod with garlic aioli, a salad and fries (sides with the entrees), and some red wine. Total was about 65 euro (with …"
193,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"When we got in, we were a little confused on the procedure. It turned out we should tell the lady behind the bar how many people were in our party, then wait at the bar until she seated us. Her serving as hostess but not taking names was a …"

195,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Don't be fooled by the modest interior or the lack of a written menu ! This place is awesome! Super friendly staff, fair prices and very Dutch atmosphere.
The food is sublime ... anything you can order is great ! …"
196,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Small place with a very homey feel. The server comes and describes the days menu to you verbally instead of printing a menu. There was obvious care taken in building the menu and everything was prepared lovingly. Had a great time. Highly recommend.
197,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Looks like a few staples are surrounded by a changing set of other options. Beef and strawberry, chicken in coconut were amazing. Starters excellent. Atmosphere wonderful. Definitely go there again....don't be late, it gets packed and you cant book."
198,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We arrived at 7pm and it was full but we sat at the bar and had a beer while we waited because the reviews were so good. We were sat at a table after about 20 minutes so not too long. My boyfriend had the garlic mussels to start which …
199,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Just incredible place,
Staff is really friendly. This restaurant usually doesn’t have a menu and cooks uniquely plates that varry in meats and fish each day. …"
200,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Went with a small group, everyone loved it and thought it was charming yet cozy. We had the starter which was a platter of spreads and slices of meatloaf, so everone had something they liked. I had the Haddock dish (18€) for my main course delicious! Completely satisfied with my experience."
201,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good prices, nice atmosphere, delishious food"
202,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cute little restaurant with a homey feel and good food. It's not fine dinging but it's good and proper without any fuzz. They'll let you know the menu as you sit down. Prices are normal and the vibe is friendly.
203,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The atmosphere is super nice - the staff is very friendly and they make the place feel cosy and like a big family meeting! :) The place looks very well, it's super close to Dam Square and the food is delicious and affordable. There is no menu, but the waiter will recite the food that they have."
204,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Oh my delicious food god, this was amazing. If they serve the Indonesian Meatloaf that day - eat it. You'll love it. Prices are totally reasonable, I paid 12€ for a huge dish.
Don't miss out on this place!"
205,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Wonderful food, extremely welcoming staff with a creative and inspired menu. We had the mussels for a starter, Indonesian chicken and steak with goat cheese/strawberry purée (which came with fries and salad)- every bite was delicious! Highly recommend for a delish, relaxed and delightful experience."
206,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Excellent food and service, especially if you've eaten around Europe. Don't be intimidated about having to remember the menu - there are only a few things on it anyway. If you can, get the Irish steak with goat cheese and strawberry sauce. Really, a great place."
207,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best food I had on my trip to Amsterdam! All 3 courses blew us away.
208,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An absolutely amazing restaurant that has no menus. Instead, a staff member will join your table for a few minutes and explain the menu on offer for the night. The food was wonderfully cooked."
209,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This small restaurant was jam packed with people midweek and the wait was long. But it was totally with the effort. The food was truly delicious! Probably the best meal that we had in Amsterdam. Try the beef with goat cheese and strawberry sauce.
210,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We decided to head early to Van Kerkwijk as we had read that it could get packed for dinner. We arrived to find two tables occupied at 6.15pm on a Wednesday night. This however changed rather quickly and the place was filled in no time. …
211,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favorite place in Amsterdam. I've been to Amsterdam twice and been here twice. Can't even remember how we found it. It a small cozy place. No reservations. The menu is recited and changes daily. The food is delicious! Small, but filling …"
212,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really nice restaurant. Come early, otherwise you might have to wait for a free table. There's no menu card, but this wasn't a problem for us. The main dish was fanstastic, while as the starter (pastrami) could've been more exiting. Nevertheless, we would definitly come here again, as the food is really good :)"
213,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very small, but cosy restaurant. The unique formula that is definitely working is there are no menus, but they will tell you personally what is available that day and answer any questions you might have. …"
214,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Only time we are out in Amsterdam, but thus place was superb! I had a ham platter starter that was really good and a cut of beef tenderloin on strawberry sauce. A new twist for me but it was excellent! Coffee and dessert (apple pie) was …"
215,van Kerkwijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"This place serves lousy food (sorry it's true if u travel around a bit!... mayo, badly cooked fish, fries & bad salad don't exactly make a great meal) and very understaffed... They get away with it by having great smiles, no menus and …"
216,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very tasteful, very lovely, everything is fine with this restaurant!"
217,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Food to die for,  but you have to wait for the table. The chef does magic out of a less than 100 sq ft kitchen. They don't ask how you want your beef cooked, it comes out rare to medium rare, perfection. Its worth the wait and get the pear tart, its a family recipe."
218,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This restaurant came recommended by a friend and I can see why. Unpretentious but delicious food and white beer on tap. Great atmosphere - everyone is crammed in but that just adds to the buzz. My fav restaurant in Amsterdam.
219,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Service was friendly and food was tasty. One slightly annoying quirk (if I can call it that) is that they don't have any menus and you are expected to remember the whole menu that the waitress reels off to you...they also never mention the price of anything! (unless you ask)
220,van Kerkwijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Terrible food, stakes were almost raw, too expensive, and three hours waiting time in a super noisy, tiny, packed place. We were not offered a menu and instead, had to put up with ambiguous explanation of the unfriendly waitress."
221,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very interesting restaurant. The waiter recites the menu!  The food was tasty and served the way I like which is perfect for sharing!  The only down side was the fellow smoking the cigar outside which wafted in the window.
222,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Worth the 45 minute wait! Family owned cozy spot with delicious menu recited by the waiters and special pear cake serviced warm with cream! Wonderful service and ambiance in the center of Amsterdam.

226,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Stumbled in here by accident. This place is precisely why Amsterdam is so popular. Casual, alternative, and very creative. You cannot put this restaurant in any category. It's like a student bar with very ecclectic food. Be adventurous and …"
227,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The mussel in garlic was perfectly cooked, super delicious eaten with their bread. However the codfish was slightly underseasoned, what a bummer. The service was great!"
228,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a lovely bar bistro. Staff are hard working and friendly. Carpaccio starter is great. I thought the steak with goat cheese and strawberry coulis is for the brave but I loved it …
229,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome concept, great service, amazing food. Down the quiet street from the crowded square by the Central station lies van Kerkwijk. They never have menu but the waiter explains you what they have. 10/10"
230,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great casual restaurant. Food is ridiculously amazing but unpretentious. Not at all expensive either despite the quality and location! Gotta be one of the best finds in my many travels
231,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice little place, menu changes daily so waitress will sit and tell you what's available. Gets busy so don't expect lightning-quick service, but staff are pleasant and helpful and the food is really very good. Toilet is down some narrow wooden steps so not ideal for anyone with serious mobility issues."
232,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When food comes down from heaven !
And Jesus turned water to beer"
233,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good. No menu the staff just tell you what they have and help make suggestions. Had a steak with strawberry sauce excellent
234,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Was looking for a quiter place away from the kings day crowd and found this place. Was perfect. Great service. Good drink selection beer and wine and a focused tasty selection of appetizers and fish meat. Yummy desserts.
235,van Kerkwijk, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Ambience is fine and the food is ok but pricey. The trick is they don't have a printed food menu with pricings, someone would walk to you and say what all can you have. That way it looks as if they are customising the food for you but in …"
236,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Relaxed environment with amazing food with an eclectic crowd. You will be welcomed by smiley staff who will take care of you throughout the evening. There is no menu, and the waiter will tell you at the table what they have - no matter what you choose it will be amazing."
237,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Had a fantastic dinner at Café van Kerkwijk. It's just a few blocks off the main square, which would usually mean very touristy and overpriced, but I think this is where Amsterdammers bring out-of-town guests for casual atmosphere, and a …"

240,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"So good. The wife was in a foul mood when I suggested a sports cafe for lunch, so a google search later ...... ""I've found the perfect place love, follow me"". I can thankfully say the food, beer, service and experience were all top notch. I recommend this hidden little gem. (The meatloaf was 10/10)"
241,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Beautiful restaurant run by 2 sisters. Menu changes each day. Food and service is excellent. Tucked away down a small Street. If you love food I highly recommend this place. Place gets very busy so get there early.
242,van Kerkwijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Unlike everyone’s review, the way they offer the menu is too confusing and wasn’t clear on the rates we had to pay! We ordered eventually the shared menu and it felt that they were trying too hard to creat tasty food by mixing different ingredients! Not recommended."
243,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Quaint little restaurant.  The starter of the day was a sharing plate of various items...mini meatloaf with a sweet chili sauce, goat cheese roll-up (I could have had many more of these), 3 different pates (mackerel, blue cheese, and pork) …"
244,van Kerkwijk, 1 star ,3 years ago,This place was so crowded and all tables were full when we entered. So we asked to the waitress how long we had to wait but she compeletely ignored and went to the bar. She was too rude as a racist. It ruined the good impression of this city. Even one star is too much to give them.
245,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a wonderful place! Dan having a Seat while taking order won our heart! Lovely restaurant with surprising dishes (tenderloin with goat cheese & strawberry sauce). C‘mon in and join the family ❤️
246,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A small, friendly establishment with no menu (the waiters recite from memory), absolutely stellar food, amazing service, and fair price. Honestly a perfect experience; nothing I would change!"
247,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool, authentic small restaurant. Delicious food. Super nice staff. At prime dinner time there is a waiting- time but worth it. I will come back..."
248,van Kerkwijk, 1 star ,4 years ago,Another restaurant that's built on the concept of waiting. I know that dining out should be slow and relaxed but where do you draw the line? I feel that these places take a sense of pride on letting you know that you'll eat on their terms. …
249,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"We spent 12 days between Amsterdam, Paris and London. Because of all the positive reviews we decided to try it. GREAT service. GREAT food. GREAT atmosphere.

255,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This restaurant was very nice for a sit-down lunch. There was a small terrace in the street with little traffic. The waitress was absolutely lovely, explained the menu and been the kindest to me ! I recommend this little café !"
256,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best ""eetcafées"" in Amsterdam. It's a cute, little café with friendly staff and unique lighting. The menu changes with the seasons, depending on what kind of produce is available. Both lunch and dinner can be enjoyed here. If …"
257,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This small family owned cafe is tucked away on a narrow street just off the Dam in central Amsterdam. This is no written menu, your server will come to your table and recite the daily selections. The food is always fresh and made to order. …"
258,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went for a late lunch,no menu but Hidde was very helpful indeed and Monica too! We ate Bol ossenworst and Indisch gehakt...amazing and very filling. Also great chips with mayo on the side.😀"

260,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy and friendly place. They have no (online) physical menu, they come and tell you the menu, with I thought was a great idea. And you can't make a reservation. But just how in and see if there is a spot, it's worth it. Because the food they serve is really good!"
261,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,On of my favorite places to eat in Amsterdam.  Hidden away off off Dam Square.  Took a little time to find the first visit.  Crowded every time I've been there for dinner.  Came in for a lunch one time and pretty much had the place to ourselves.  Staff is very helpful and friendly.
262,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Spent a couple of weeks exploring Europe and this place was our favorite restaurant.  Great staff and great food.  Don’t be in a hurry... just sit back relax and enjoy a great dining experience!!!!

Beef with goats cheese and strawberry sauce is a MUST!"
264,van Kerkwijk, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"I can only think that the 4/5 star reviews by others are for dinner. We went for lunch. And was disappointed. Only soups, salads, and sandwiches. I had a sandwich and it was very average. Service was good though. So if you're looking for lunch, looks elsewhere is my verdict."
265,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Incredible food and 5 star service for 2 star prices. I have been all over Europe and this was among the very best, if not the best meal I've had during my travels. I will definitely be back."

We popped in here for dinner after looking for something that wasn't a touristy …"

269,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had tender beef with strawberry sauce and goats cheese.

273,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My partner and I went to this restaurant last night. After seeing the 4.5 star rating (out of 1.182 reviews) we were quite impressed. The restaurant is located in a very quiet street behind the Nationaal Monument. …

285,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The food was good. However I hated the fact that they dont have a menu with prices. The waitress tells you what they have. And you need to ask for the price. You could have a bill surprise at the end.
286,van Kerkwijk, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"High prices, good food. The Cook forgot about our order so they made us wait a long time to have something to eat. Stay away from this place."

301,van Kerkwijk, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food and ambience will win you over. Just don't be in a rush. Providing you have nowhere to be the food is great. The waiter will see you at thier pace so sit back and enjoy.
302,van Kerkwijk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food, very friendly. It seems the sand on the floor is a tradition or something like that. Best restaurant on that busy touristic area."
