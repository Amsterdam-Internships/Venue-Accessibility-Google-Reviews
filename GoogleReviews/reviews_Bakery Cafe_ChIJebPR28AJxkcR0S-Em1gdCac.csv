0,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"Worst boba ever!
The woman attending us gave us milk with boba flavorless even when we ordered taro and honeydew - expensive and terrible. Worst destination in Amsterdam by far"

2,Bakery Cafe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Late night cafe in the heart of Amsterdam. They didn't have a menu as had only been open for a month, or so we were told.
We paid €11 for a crepe and a coffee which I thought was quite expensive. The …"
3,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,3 months ago,I don’t recommend this place. The prices are not put on display and you end up paying triple the real amount of the product. I bought some chocolate chip cookies for 20€ and at some nearby shop we found out that the same cookies are 6€. After a few hours we went again to ask for the price and they changed it to 15€…

We paid €16 for two muffins(not space cakes) , we got them to go, so we could …"
8,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,a year ago,Not worth it at all. You can get the same stuff from a super market at half the price and it will be tastier than the ones you get from here. We fell for the trap by looking at the photos and missed reading the reviews. Always read the reviews guys!
9,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Charged €22 for a plain chocolate waffle, sandwich and a look warm coffee. The young girl that served me was ignorant and lacked basic customer service skills. Asked for it to be warmed up, got it cold. This place is a joke and I would be embarrassed if this was my establishment. Rip off!"
10,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,RIP off!! Avoid at every cost! Paid 22 euros for 2 coffees and two toasts! Made the mistake not to ask for prices. He didn't return money even after we asked for it and he didn't start to make the tosts and the coffees.Also didn't give receipt. Tourist trap.
11,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very very expensive for the most basic, cheap food. Looks nice in the window, but the sausage used was from a jar and microwaved to heat it up, resulting in soggy, dense bread. - €9 for this shambles."
12,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This is the worst cafe in Amsterdam! Wish we had read reviews before going in. 25 euros for two cakes. Drinks served in paper cups served by a real moody lady. What a rip off, avoid at all costs."

15,Bakery Cafe, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I had the waffle with Nutella, it was not bad, but it was way below average. What i disliked the most that the worker there along with a guest were talking about politics loudly, and talking bad about my country knowing that i am from that …"
16,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,Fraud - simply put. The lady is a fraud which makes me question the ingredients in the food. Charged way more for the same box of cookies a store down the street and wouldn’t refund when confronted about it. I fell for the tourist trap so hope you don’t.
17,Bakery Cafe, 1 star ,2 years ago,This is a rip off €15 for a tasteless waffle and 2 cans of pop. Thing is the place that used to be here was really good. Shame on you for ripping off visitors to this lovely city.
