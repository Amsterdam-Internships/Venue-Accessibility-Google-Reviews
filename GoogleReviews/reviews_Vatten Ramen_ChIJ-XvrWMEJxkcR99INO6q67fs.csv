7,Vatten Ramen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Probably the best broth of the main Ramen places in the city center. At the time I was there service was super slow, but the servers were nice. It has a couple of seats right by the window facing the canal, make a reservation if you want to seat there."

10,Vatten Ramen, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Ramen with a view! I was craving for some ramen and have a goal to try all of the new ramen places in Amsterdam. I was missing the oomph in the chicken broth and the slices of chicken meat were tasteless. The karaage delivered though. (For pork lovers, no pork here options by the way. )"
11,Vatten Ramen, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"20 minutes after ordering they tell us they don‚Äôt have rice and they can‚Äôt serve us the chicken teriyaki don we ordered.

41,Vatten Ramen, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"We followed the good reviews and decided to try this place. There are only 3 chicken ramen options and 3 vegan.

42,Vatten Ramen, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,So good!
43,Vatten Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The ramen tastes really authentic. The serving is just enough. The best thing is that you get the best view while enjoying your hot and steamy food. The crew were friendly as well. Good job and I highly recommend this restaurant.
44,Vatten Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This may be my new favorite ramen place in Amsterdam. The place may look a bit plain (i.e. not much of a Japanese flair) and I wasn't impressed with the green tea, but in the end it's the ramen that matters: ‚Ä¶"
45,Vatten Ramen, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was okay, your broth needs deeper flavour, but the reason for 2 stars is you have to let people split bills, it‚Äôs 2021 come on."

49,Vatten Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They know how to make a decent bowl of ramen! Great service as well, it was pretty quiet on King's night and we weren't rushed out even though we were the last customers.

58,Vatten Ramen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the rare tonkotsu ramen places in Amsterdam.  Overall decent, but the ramen was not hot enough; maybe a localization thing."
59,Vatten Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ramen, especially the chashu and the egg are to die for. Only downside is the egg is not always included so you have to order it separately as a topping. Completely worth the extra money, however."
60,Vatten Ramen, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Im not really sure where the restaurant heading, perhaps they after 'more european flavor' but definitely not authentic ramen flavor. The broth is quite tasty though not super rich broth, the curly noodle is quite soft and okay, chicken ‚Ä¶"

79,Vatten Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"really tasty and authentic food. The Service is not as slow as some of the negative reviews claim, good food takes time so it is definitely worth the 15-20 minute wait. They did mess up our order and brought us a chicken ramen instead of a vegan options, but we are not vegan and the chicken option was delicious too :)"
