0,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Great little restaurant. Food was good and good size portions too. Staff were all very friendly and accommodating. So happy to have discovered this restaurant.
1,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nasi Kunin Tujuh Maret is worth a try, you get to taste 12 indonesian dishes! We were a bit hungry but this seems to still be too much for two though ü§£ I wish it was possible to put the chili on the side though since the level of tolerance ‚Ä¶"
2,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There are two Indonesian restaurants close to each other, so make sure not to confuse them. ‚Ä¶"
3,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,3 months ago,I am giving it four instead of five stars just for the prices! Slightly expensive but it was a lovely dinner. The owner was a great host. Recommended if you want to experience Indonesia's food flavours!
4,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Indonesian food with good quality ingredients. Loved all the beef dishes!!
Some dishes are quite spicy, perfect if you like spicy food. Oh ask for the sambal, it‚Äôs good too. The staff are really friendly too!"
5,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Make sure you make Reservation, it‚Äôs well worth it. First time Indonesian food wow.  Great service, friendly people. Enjoy the experience. We had the Chefs menu for 4. Sample of all items."
6,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and great service! The owner came and chatted with us about his mother and her recipes. A bit pricey but well worth it for one of the best Indonesian meals we‚Äôve ever had (and we‚Äôre from Singapore)!
7,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Surprising to know that you can find rijstafel or ""rice table"" here but not in Indonesia. It is a big meal with ten+ of side dishes. Taste is amazing!!! ‚Ä¶"
8,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I've enjoyed many 'rijsttafels' over the years, but this restaurant definitely served the best. We shared the chef's special ""Minahasa' which at ‚Ç¨30 per person for 18x dishes plus two styles of rice represented very good value for money. ‚Ä¶"
9,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing rice table. Highly reccomend. Great variety of flavours and textures.

Especially the satay. ‚Ä¶"
10,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was delicious and definitely authentic. The food tasting plate provided a wide range of tastes and spices. Besides the tasty food we were taken aback by the cost of the food. Considering the portion in relation to  the price, the restaurant was on the pricy side."
11,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy Indonesian place. Quick service, also cater for vegetarians. We could also order a single vegetarian sample plate although 2 people minimum according to the menu. No Indonesian beer tough. Some dishes were as to be expected very spicy. ‚Ä¶"
12,Tujuh Maret, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food and service was ok. But menu explanation part was confusing.
We ordered ‚ÄúMinahasa‚Äù expecting it will cost 29,75 EUR for two of us to share, but we were charged double, 59.50 EUR ‚Ä¶"
13,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Me and my friend ended up here because the more famous Indonesian restaurants were fully booked. We didn't regret the decision as the rice table was very good and extensive. The dishes were tasty but nothing extraordinary. If they would be ‚Ä¶
14,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic service and food. I don‚Äôt eat beef or pork so they kindly modified the Nasi Kuning Rijsttafel (Rice Table) set meal. The dishes were delicious and varied. Price was very reasonable (for Amsterdam!). Service was very friendly. All in all highly recommended.
15,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Both Ferdi and Chayenne, who own the place are friendly and approachable. The beef rendang is fantastic and the satay kambing is good.
A family oriented atmosphere with pleasant hospitality and tasty food.
A definite must for anyone in the area. Do book early as it's always busy."
16,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fantastic food and experience. Would highly recommend the Chef's Special Rice Table. Exquisite food and flavours. Super service to boot.
17,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Ordered the rijsttafel minahasi and I definitely recommend. I love not having to choose and you get a taste of everything!
18,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Indonesia food in Amsterdam. It‚Äôs all about ordering the Rice Table - 24 meat and vegetable dishes of varying spice levels. Do try!
19,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent food and friendly boss. Food is fresh and tasty. Once you start you can‚Äôt stop.
20,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We thoroughly enjoyed our rijkstafel dinner at Tujuh Maret. Its a charming little place with caring service right next to (the much more expensive) Tempo Doloe.
21,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was excellent! I had the rijsttafel, and every dish was bursting with flavor. The spicy dishes had just the right amount of heat--hot enough to make you sweat a bit without overpowering the flavor. The service was excellent as well ‚Ä¶"
22,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Although they only had two beers on the menu, the food was a festival of tastes. The price is decent, the satay is marvelous, the place is cozy. If you want to have some Indonesian food, get a table and eat here."
23,Tujuh Maret, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Tourist trap, high price foe a very low quality food. There is no good coocker in this kitchen!"

25,Tujuh Maret, 1 star ,2 years ago,"AVOID.
Reasons below: ‚Ä¶"
26,Tujuh Maret, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Found it too expensive for the quantity. 75 euro for 3 small portions? Nice food but confusing menu. We were 5 people. They brought us 3 sharing portions. Much smaller in size than the first time I was there.  Felt like they were catering ‚Ä¶
27,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Had a really pleasant dinner here with my friends. We shared a few main and side dishes. The food was good, and the service was friendly. Their signature dish 'Indonesian Rijstafel' is a must try. Would definitely come back!"
28,Tujuh Maret, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Simply rude.  Turned up at 6, and chose dishes from the menu totaling 40 euro only to be told that was only a snack.  Could only order from 2 pages of the menu that were set dishes, far too much food for 2 people.   Found the waiter to be ‚Ä¶"
29,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We ordered the Rijsttafel Minahasa (larger version of their ""rice table""). It comes with 24 little veggie and meat dishes, split up into 3 stages: mild, medium, and spicy; served with satay and prawn crackers as appetizers, white and ‚Ä¶"
30,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had the meat rice table which was amazing. We sat in the window seat eating and I think everyone that saw what we're eating came in as it got very busy very quickly . Don't miss out on this family run little gem . Service was excellent as every one of our 21 dishes was explained . üëç
31,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was good and really spicy!
32,Tujuh Maret, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We opted for the cheaper meal set as we know we were unable to finish it. The owner of the restaurant tried to sell us the more expensive set. After deliberation we decided against it. When we got the bill, I noticed that we are beung ‚Ä¶"

34,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful food and great service. Can't wait to come back.
35,Tujuh Maret, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Spotty. A very mixed meal - not sure this is what I would call a culinary desirable destination. A real mixed offering - and not quite what you would expect. I think it being situated next to a Michelin starred Indonesian Restaraunt must be ‚Ä¶
36,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great 'rice table', really good for vegetarians. Vegan would be harder but they did bring a couple dishes specially made for our vegan at the table. Wait staff friendly enough."
37,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty authentic Indonesian food in a quaint neighbourhood. Friendly boss and staff who will explain to you the different kind of food being served. A must go if you are looking for nice Asian food in Amsterdam.
38,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very cosy place with really good Indonesian food.
39,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Local Indo joint, and one of the best places in Amsterdam for more authentic Rijstafel experience. If you're a spicy lover, have the dishes spicy when the lovely lady asks, otherwise ask for it mild. It has a kick! If coming as a ‚Ä¶"

Their gado-gado is on point and all their dishes are very well done."
42,Tujuh Maret, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Indonesian dish for dinner . I ordered ""Pepes Ikan"" super yummy and super spicy üå∂. The resto quite busy and food quite expensive tho. The place is small, so you have wait outside in busy hours , so better you make a resrvation #lol. The owner is funny and friendly guy."
43,Tujuh Maret, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very disappointed. We ordered the Rijstafel  and cod. The cod was OK, nothing to write home about. The Rijstafel  was either too sweet or too spicy. Out of the 18 tiny plates, the only thing I enjoyed was the eggplant. Alas, it was only a tiny plate.  Way over priced for either the Rijstafel  or cod."

45,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, friendly staff, No frills"
46,Tujuh Maret, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, but four people got the rice table with all the dishes sampled, and it was 120 euro! Way to expensive for a small amount of food. The dishes were tiny."
47,Tujuh Maret, 1 star ,2 years ago,"So, so food but appallingly they charged us 1.75 for a pitcher of tap water!!!!!!  The waitress warned me about it but I honestly thought she was joking.  I¬¥ve never experienced this before and I¬¥ve eaten in a lot of restaurants in many countries around the world"
48,Tujuh Maret, 1 star ,5 years ago,"10min after ordering we got food, which was heated up in a microwave.
It tasted exactly like you are imagining it...
Three different waiters were serving even though nobody else was in the local.
Can't recommend at all."
49,Tujuh Maret, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and great service!
A little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for in quality indonesian food. I would recomend this place for anybody visiting Amsterdam lookin‚Äô for some good eats and calm atmosphere."
50,Tujuh Maret, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Decent food here. Was very surprised as it did not look like there was anyone cooking. Seemed like the waiter was plating the food as well as serving customers. ‚Ä¶
