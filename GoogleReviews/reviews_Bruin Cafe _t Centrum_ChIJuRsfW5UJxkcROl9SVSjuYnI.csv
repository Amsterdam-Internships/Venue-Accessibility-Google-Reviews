0,Bruin Cafe 't Centrum, 2 stars ,7 months ago,We were here for breakfast and when my colleagues got their food I was also looking forward to mine. For 7.5 euros it was simply inedible and very uncharitably arranged. Have eaten in Amsterdam for the same price much better.
1,Bruin Cafe 't Centrum, 4 stars ,6 months ago,It was good to have a meeting before lunch time. The service was good and also the food
2,Bruin Cafe 't Centrum, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We often call in the Bruincaf√© 't Centrum when we visit Amsterdam. Not for any other reason than we went on our first ever trip and we really enjoyed sitting in the bar with a drink and a plate of bar nibbles...so why go anywhere else. ‚Ä¶
3,Bruin Cafe 't Centrum, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had a nice beer browered in Amsterdam (Browerij' T ij) with the Dutch bitterballen. The terrace is heated and a plaid provided.

5,Bruin Cafe 't Centrum, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Be careful with this place.
The prices on the draught beers menu are per half pint. So basically if you order a pint that would cost around ‚Ç¨9! Probably the most expensive beer in Europe.
Even if that was the case the waiting staff should have advised the client."
