0,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Super spot for a nice friends brunch! The menu is full of delicious choice and the atmosphere is great. The deco was a little confusing and the music a little too loud. Otherwise the taste of ingredients is really good for very affordable ‚Ä¶
1,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Wide variety of healthy pancakes, including vegan options! Lovely place with colorful menus that include sweet, savory, vegan pancakes, juices, coffee and baked goods. The savory pancakes surprised me, I loved the hummus and avocado. The ‚Ä¶"
2,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 2 stars ,3 months ago,I tried the infamous pancake and it tasteless. Pancake itself is not soft and doesn‚Äôt absorb the chocolate or peanut better sauce. Also chocolate sauce it is taste like chocolate syrup. American Coffee was average. In general dishes are nice for photography only.
3,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"We usually have Dutch pancakes but this restaurant was close to somewhere we had to be at noon and had vegan options. I had the blueberry vegan pancake, and i loved the option to have the blueberries in the batter or on the pancake. My wife ‚Ä¶"
4,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice place to have breakfast. There are sweet, salty and vegan options. Pancakes are really good and fluffy. Nice homemade juices too. Make sure to be an early bird to avoid waiting outside to be placed."
5,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Really cozy place, I love pancakes and these were absolutely yummy!
Good service, cool environment, and really nice food and drinks! ‚Ä¶"
6,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Visually pleasing but cheap ingredients: pistachio ice cream is not made from pistachio nuts (mostly pale green colorant) and the maple syrup is fake as well - totally lacks its smokey typical flavor. ‚Ä¶
7,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Lovely place, great pancakes and many options (salty/sugary, vegan, juices‚Ä¶)"
8,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Amazing place and amazing pancakes. Best experience ever!! I felt like in the US
9,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very Delicious Pancakes, a bit expensive (around 15 euros for pancakes and a hot drink), can be crowded, you'd have to wait outside on queue to be seated. Worth it."
10,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"I loved the scenery, the interior was really cool and very instagram friendly. We had read online that they had a gluten free option here, but unfortunately they did not. The server was very sweet and asked if they could whip something else ‚Ä¶"

14,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perhaps the best tasting pancakes I‚Äôve ever had. I appreciated their menu offerings, since I‚Äôve never seen peanut butter, chocolate and bananas on pancakes together before. Tasty! Staff was friendly and attentive, place was clean and they ‚Ä¶"
15,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"I went to this restaurant because they had vegan options. They have 3 vegan pancakes and I tried the one with home made saffron pistachio ice cream, blackberries and maple syrup. Didn't like the ice cream at all and the pancakes were a ‚Ä¶"

17,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Moak is a nice breakfast spot in central Amsterdam that serves seemingly pancakes as their specialty.  We order two dishes of pancakes with various toppings as well as some fresh juice.  The pancakes dishes were a good portion.  The ‚Ä¶
18,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hands down the best pancakes you will ever have in your life. Location is great and easily accessible. Get there before 11 and you should avoid the queues. ‚Ä¶
19,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"The vegan pancakes had a very weird taste, almost didn't finish them. My own homemade pancakes are waaayyy better, it should be the other way around. I'll never go back here again."
20,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"They are definitely not stingy on the toppings. Nice place to have american pancakes and there are a lot of different varieties to choose from. However, we had to wait to be seated for quite some time."
21,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"The pancakes are alright but not really measuring up to their pricing. The vegan avocado pancakes were good, the blueberry ones tasted like the gas oven had been emptied on it, also very dry and rather no blueberries at all??"
22,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best place to eat pancake in Amsterdam. Staffs are very friendly and the pancakes are delicious. If you are in Amsterdam and want to have pancakes then have a go, you will love it. It‚Äôs also near the antique market which is a bonus. Enjoy!!"
23,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious Pancakes, fresh juices and lovely staff!"
24,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 3 stars ,5 months ago,It was delicious but you have to wait outside. In my opinion nothing special.
25,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Alright pancakes. Topping was good. Seating average and not very comfy. Took long to get served, waiting time outside was not worth it."
26,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best American style pancakes (flap jack style) in Amsterdam. You have to try the Infamous pancakes with Homemade chocolate sauce, melted peanut butter, strawberries, bananas and black berries. The real coconut juice is a hangover cure after ‚Ä¶"
27,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"What a cosy place where you can have delicious pancakes. I really really love how they make them and the wide selection of tastes.
But as they say: everything comes at a cost, and for sure you will notice that bill will be a bit pricey."
28,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,üòµ‚Äçüí´ pancakes are normal. Can make it at home. In the netherlands its better to get Pannenkoek(a tradidtional dutch pancake.) this one is just regular american batter. And ridiculously high priced
29,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious ! The place looks great and the food is amazing ! The staff is very friendly
30,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Yummy tasteful pancakes. The place is cozy and easily reachable by public transportation. Service is fast and the staff is friendly. Various sweet and savory pancakes. The pricing is reasonable for the service and food quality.
31,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,a year ago,"On the pricier end but perfectly fits the bill of a fun, trendy breakfast place. In my experience, finding American style pancakes isn't too easy but this place does them well and does them in all kinds of styles. The interior is light and bright and the staff was very friendly."
32,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"One of the popular places near Central for  some quality pancakes, but beware, their pancakes are larger than your usual size and so fluffy, you might not need anything else with them! Price wise, they're on the usual mark, and you don't ‚Ä¶"

37,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely love this place! The Veggielious pancake is delicious. It has hummus, bell peppers and avocados.

38,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The Pancakes here are amazing the last two times I visited Amsterdam my browns brought me here to get the ‚ÄúMancake‚Äù absolutely fantastic! The only thing I dislike about this place is there there isn‚Äôt one in Ireland( where I am from) I show pictures to my fitness and tell them if they are ever in Amsterdam to go here!
39,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you like eating pancakes and telling your Instagram fam about where you ate the most delicious pancakes, this is the place for you. The ambience of the restaurant is very diner like but quirkier and they have a massive menu of just pancakes. It's a big enough restaurant with ample seating unlike most of the restaurants in Dam."
40,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Place is really Nice, service is great the people are super friendly! I have to say my pancake looked better than it tasted, it was a teeny bit dry (but I normally soak my pancake in syrup so it could just be me). Though my boyfriend's mancake was really delicious and juicy üòç would definitely come again and try some new toppings"
41,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good, Coffee not Special. Service gave us the seat near the door, which opens every 3min and it gets very cold. Could be made better to stop the cold air from outside."

46,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very Nice American pankcakes, not much service, price for drinks is too expensive, coconut juice costs ‚Ç¨7.5!"
47,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place to start into the day. The service was great. Pancakes really yummy, after them you don‚Äôt get hungry for a completely half day. The juices were a really vitamin flash! 1 star- for the high prices..."
48,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I like the savory pancakes. Coffee is just OK, but some nice fresh juices. Vibe is all right, servers are kind. But the new rebrand and menu feel to me like this place is trying to be something that is more LA/NYC than Amsterdam. For ‚Ä¶"
49,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutly amazing! I loved everything about this place. The interiors are very ‚Äúinstragamable‚Äù and the whole vibe is so cool.

102,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"An American style pancake place that has a couple vegan options.

103,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wide selection of pancakes to choose from. We got two different types and were happy with both.

Great staff , especially Josh !!!"

109,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place wasn't for us, we were looking for a traditional pancake house... But great, friendly staff, funky menus, wide variety of things for those that are vegan or on certain diets. The layout was fresh, unique, sort of quaint. ‚Ä¶"

119,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Love this is perhaps my favorite pancakes in Amsterdam.... They are pricy but they actually give you a real serving unlike many pancake places in Amsterdam. All the food is very fresh and love the open kitchen area, always a good bonus ‚Ä¶"
120,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 1 star ,a year ago,"Unfortunately, the food was terrible. We had the vegan pancakes. The dough was off, something didn‚Äôt taste right and the coffee was bitter. They use plastic straws... but the waitress was very friendly. However we won‚Äôt come back."
121,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best pancakes in Amsterdam, you have to try them!

Location is nice, just keep in mind you can pay only by card (which is something pretty common in Amsterdam)"
122,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,2 years ago,American style pancakes with different toppings -sweet or salty. Portions seem small but are very filling so you will be leaving with full tummy. Friendly staff. Interior is quite 'minimalistic' and could be improved.
123,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very tasty pancakes and a really friendly staff. Both sweet and savory pancakes were awesome. I would definitely want to eventually try out everything on the menu so to many more visits!
124,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The pancakes are delicious, very friendly staff, and the vibe is chill and relaxed.

126,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best places in Amsterdam to have Pancakes. Amazingly soft and extremely tasty. They have a pancake that is served with hummus which tastes simply mindblowing. Its a weird combination but worth trying. I have never found the place ‚Ä¶

129,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Was here in two occasions. First time there was a bit of a mixup with my order, but they remedied by not charging for it. Second time it was flawless. Pancakes themselves at first seem bland tasting, mainly because they are very healthy. ‚Ä¶"

138,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Overpriced American style pancakes. After keeping us waiting for 40min for our food, staff told us ‚Äòwe‚Äôre closing in 15 minutes, but if you can‚Äôt finish it in time we can give you a doggy bag‚Äô. Can‚Äôt think of any reason to go here."
139,MOAK Pancakes - City Center, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good pancakes, vegetarian friendly and great environment and music. Several salty and sweet options to choose.
