1,Benji's, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"An underwhelming experience - photogenic dishes, but not tasty! The atmosphere and decorations are pleasant for laid-back work, but the kitchen and waiting staff was disappointing. The Buddha bowl I ordered was extremely bland and dry …"
2,Benji's, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Just great food, with variety. The place was a bit crowded on Saturday, but we were able to find ourselves a nice place on the terrace. One of my favorite spots in Amsterdam for breakfast/lunch."
3,Benji's, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"The locations is quiet nice, looks really special with all the plants at the top of this room! The food is also okay but not sensational."
4,Benji's, 2 stars ,a month ago,"The service has a lot to improve. They mixed up the tables (which we had booked in advance), and after 15 minutes, we sorted out. When we sat, the napkins on the table had been used by the previous customer, but the waitress changed when we …"
5,Benji's, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"I greatly enjoyed the food and a satisfying variety of options for a brunch. As a brunch destination, I was let down by the fact that Mimosa was not available at 11:30am as they’ve ran out of fresh orange juice - at the beginning of a …"
6,Benji's, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very cute interior with fresh and delicious healthy food. The serving size is quite large which makes the price a very good deal!
7,Benji's, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Not worth it. Delighting customers is not the priority. Staff is not professional and make you wait a long time. Setting is nice but seating is uncomfortable, I sat on these chairs enough during elementary school. …"
8,Benji's, 2 stars ,a month ago,"What a gorgeous place! We were very excited to go there for Saturday brunch and tried to repeatedly book a table, but the online system seemed to have all weekends blocked out. So we showed up at the restaurant and asked the lady at the bar …"
9,Benji's, 4 stars ,a month ago,Benji is a cozy place. They serve healthy and tasty dishes. They have both savory and sweet food. I also liked their juices. Staff is very nice and friendly.

Nice interior with plants, lots of light and ambient music. …"
12,Benji's, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"I've been here many times with Amsterdam friends, as well as visiting family. It has a great atmosphere & the food is of a great quality. I nearly always have the Tropical bowl which has loads of toppings. I have also tried a couple of the other dishes and they've always been amazing. Can't recommend Benji's enough!"
13,Benji's, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Certainly one of the best Eggs Benedict I've had here in Amsterdam. The service is also fast good, and the people working here are very kind."
14,Benji's, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Slow service. Mess up with the order. So we got our food separately and the second dish hadn’t even arrived when I was already finished with mine. They took the drinks off the bill but it was still a bad experience. 3 stars just because the food was tasty. Also would be great to have gluten-free alternatives.
15,Benji's, 5 stars ,a month ago,Love their coffee and juices. The smoked salmon and avocado is very yummy and service is usually very fast.
16,Benji's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice service, really good cheesecake, but also the breakfast bun was good. My friend got lentil based burgers and they were really tasty! Next time might take those :) and price is also really fine. I'll surely come back!"
17,Benji's, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Great potential but victim of it's ow  success.

Very nice people but a total lack of structure and efficiency. Avoid when busy. …"
18,Benji's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A beautifully designed breakfast and lunch spot in Amsterdam East. The menu has various food options from Smoothie Bowls, over sandwiches, wraps and salads, fresh juices, tea and good coffee. The dishes look lovely. They have a big table in …"
19,Benji's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hip café with urban jungle vibe! The food was very tasty and a treat for the eyes as well. You might have to wait about 15 minutes for your order but it's worth it. The atmosphere and staff was lovely, would recommend for breakfast."
20,Benji's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A gorgeous hipster-chic interior with a lot of greens that we've discovered by chance but were so pleased we did. Thanks for the vegan-friendly options! Literally THE best smoothie bowls I've ever had. Not to forget the wraps that were …
21,Benji's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the light in the place , and how it’s decorated. Really nice people work there. We came for lunch at 12 and there was no line still. But in an hour it was totally full and the line , so be aware :) also the food was super nice. Asian …"
22,Benji's, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Beautiful interior and a nice terrace out front. The food is nice though pricey, which is to be expected for a place like this in Amsterdam. The food did take a bit too long to come out which explains the lack of the 5th star."
23,Benji's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely interior, decorated with many plants and lots of natural light coming in through the huge windows. Loved the atmosphere and would go again either for coffee or to study. If I would change one thing, though, that would be the carrot cake. It was pretty bad tasting and given its price and the small portion, I expected more."
24,Benji's, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Tuna melt roll is very much recommended. The hot sauce is second to none. Well done team. Update: They unfortunately replaced it with a Burger type tuna which is by far not a good idea.
25,Benji's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great open and cozy brunch place. Super busy and but super friendly service. Only the fresh juices cannot be changed. Will definatly go again!
26,Benji's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Just ate here for a second time.  Found the staff polite, positive and welcoming.  The Buddha salad was scrumptious.  The watermelon juice lovely. Fresh flowers on the table (in clean clear water).  Very pleasant atmosphere with lots of green, windows and light.  Clean establishment."

28,Benji's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,What a cool place. Don't think it's in a quite place in Amsterdam. The location may be but the place is quite full at an early Saturday. Nice menu - had the breakfast Yoghurt Granola and that was excellent. Good granola with Greek Yoghurt …
29,Benji's, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious coffee and food. The only downside is long waiting time.
30,Benji's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice brunch options covering all the bases, delicious bread for the toast and the fluffiest scone. The staff was nice and we did not have to wait too much for our food, however it wasn't very crowded. The inside is really pretty with …"

32,Benji's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved this place. Really lovely interior, bright and open with plenty of seating. A bit of something for everyone on the menu, leaning more towards healthy dishes.

35,Benji's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This was a lovely find! The place is cosy with lots of plants, tables, chairs...it’s a good place to work as well because of free wifi and lots of plugs. I ordered a salmon teriyaki with avocados and it was good. Service was great too. Will definitely come back :)"
36,Benji's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lots of space available both inside and out.

Good menu. It caters mainly for brunch/lunch. You do have to go up to the front …"
37,Benji's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We visited benjis for a light lunch. I fell in love with the interior of the restaurant - natural light and a lot of plants. We both ordered wraps, I went for the tuna melt wrap (not light i know) and I was not disappointed. The food was amazing, the service was great and the place is nicely decorated. Would recommend."

Nice interior and atmosphere."
45,Benji's, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Great taste and too expensive for poor students, but those are rare in Holland. This is often the result of studying effectively on postcodeschool.nl"

47,Benji's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Utterly beautiful. Had the most delicious breakfast, lovely staff and gorgeous interior. Will absolutely visit again when I'm back in Amsterdam. (worth noting that it's really close to the metro, very handy)"

53,Benji's, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Nice food but the restaurant is way too busy for their very limited kitchen & staff capacities during lunch hours. Unfortunately the service suffers as a result and we waited an hour for the food.
54,Benji's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Perfect place to get your hungover ass some food and lay back for a bit to reminisce about the day before. The salmon avocado teriyaki was bomb. Pricewise pretty inexpensive

56,Benji's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice cafe and breakfast & lunch place. Delicious food and reasonably priced. The only problem I have with dutch cafe’s is that they don’t serve filter coffee 😳 Americano is your closest alternative...

79,Benji's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Modern decoration, with plants etc inside. The food is ok with many healthy options. I don't like that you have to order at the bar and I find it a bit annoying. Also the coffee must be improved a bit. Overall a very good option in this area."

When I was there all the people lunching were kind of hipsters. Fun to watch."
86,Benji's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and coffee. However they are very unfriendly towards people wanting to work.
