0,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,4 months ago,There weren‚Äôt any price tag and this was for 7 euros. Heard him quoting someone else 6 euros just when we were leaving. Tourist trap!
1,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Tourist scam, don‚Äôt go!

Overpriced items, and unhygienic, the man serving us sold ‚Äúspace cakes‚Äù that didn‚Äôt contain  any THC, but he acted as if it did, and that it would be strong as ‚Äú4-5 joints‚Äù"
2,Ice Bakery, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Prices are exorbitantly high. Each scoop of ice Cream is priced 2.5, which is ridiculously high. Other stores at least provide a discount on incremental scoops but here they are exploiting just because it‚Äôs located in a tourist spot. The ‚Ä¶"
3,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Nice decorated place, but they don‚Äôt usually get your order right, I ordered a strawberry with Nutella Crepes, and in a instant of distraction... I got a banana Nutella. It wasn‚Äôt worth it to argue with it, and it wasn‚Äôt any tasty and a good experience!"

8,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,3 months ago,13 euros for a donut and 9 churros. There were tasteless and not fresh at all.
9,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,3 years ago,Don‚Äôt eat or work there. There are better places. Maybe you will be lucky enough to get a fresh croissant in the morning perhaps they will be from the day before. Nothing else is fresh and the place is full of mice and birds walking inside ‚Ä¶

17,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Over priced food and shoddy service. The guy did not pay attention to our order, (too busy bouncing off the walls shouting and chatting people up). Then seemed to add a few extra euros to the price. Nearly 20 euros for something you'd get ‚Ä¶"
18,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,2 years ago,How in gods name can a crepe and a brownie be worth 17 euro? It was also the most average tasteless crepe I have ever had and the owner seemed to be high on something. Do yourself a favour and just go to McDonald's instead.
19,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,2 years ago,In this place i had really a bad experience. I entered it because of the nice decoration but after i regretted it because of how the stuff there was simply mega unprofessional. ‚Ä¶
20,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,7 months ago,The gelato was inferior and the woman serving it was unfriendly. Portions were small.

23,Ice Bakery, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had a nice breakfast here outside on the patio and dessert crepes in the evening. Such great crepes with nutella and banana. The service was very good from the girl with black/red hair and the guy with the ponytail. Thank you!
24,Ice Bakery, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The service was very abrupt, when we asked if we could sit in, the waitress response was that we could but had to order with her immediately so we were rushed into picking what we wanted. The macaroons were tasty and reasonably priced. However there were no bathroom facilities available which seemed unusual."
25,Ice Bakery, 2 stars ,2 years ago,i‚Äôve wanted to try their churros for ages and when i finally did yesterday i was extremely disappointed. they taste like fried soggy cardboard with a homeopathic dose of sugar on top and all of that for a ridiculous price. don‚Äôt go there it‚Äôs a rip off and the ‚Äúquality‚Äù is a joke.
26,Ice Bakery, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had a dark chocolate crepe and it was delicious! Desserts in the case didn't look so great (stale and sweaty), but my crepe was great."
27,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,2 years ago,"CARE!! The moment you order something, the price displayed is no longer valid. Somehow they understand when we order, but can't speak when asked about the price difference. Save your money since it's worth more and take it somewhere else in this beautiful city."
28,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The cashier man and the other girl services was rude, they were imitate the way how we talked just in front of our face. That was a horrible and a nightmare. I just can't believe you're as an owner decided to hire them. It make the taste of your cookies bad and reflects from their attitude."
29,Ice Bakery, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Overpriced. I paid 11 euros for a cold waffle. Cookies were soggy as if they have been exposed for a while. It is just a tourist trap

32,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,4 years ago,Awful service. They say fresh waffles but all they do is reheat them. No idea when the waffles are really made but they were really soggy. Waitress was really rude too.
33,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Absolutely exploitative, charge extra if you sit down, but do not advise you of additional cost. The menus are very confusing and this appears to be deliberate. Very small portions and incredibly deceptive."
34,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Sly and misleading price. Ordered a ‚Ç¨3 advertised cappuccino, ended up paying ‚Ç¨5. The place does not look that hygienic either."
35,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Apple cake and coffee were very expensive but tastes OK. But they don‚Äôt have a bathroom, the WiFi doesn‚Äôt work and the interior seating is quite unpleasant."

38,Ice Bakery, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Regular location, not the best option in Amsterdam."
39,Ice Bakery, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The sweets are nice and it is represented so nicely and inviting. It is worth taking a look and try some bits.
40,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,4 years ago,Disgusting! Churros and cake were stale and horribly over priced don‚Äôt be fooled by the pretty display. Stay away! Tourist trap.
41,Ice Bakery, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"We ate waffle with nuttela and strawberries,  the waffle wasn't great but the topping were good"

50,Ice Bakery, 3 stars ,4 years ago,These kind of shops in Amsterdam could improve a lot from both quality and pricing.
51,Ice Bakery, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Ice cream was ok, but I disliked their approach, first I needed to pay, only after that they asked which ice cream I want."
52,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,5 years ago,Expensive 10 euros for 12 churros rewarmed and without taste
53,Ice Bakery, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great taste. Try stroop waffles for amsterdam tourists
54,Ice Bakery, 1 star ,5 years ago,Don't go to the frozen yoghurt trap in the back of the store. They charge you ridiculous amounts for what you get.
