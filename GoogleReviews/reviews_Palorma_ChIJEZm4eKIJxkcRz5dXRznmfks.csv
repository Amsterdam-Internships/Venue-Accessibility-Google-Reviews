2,Palorma, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Great service (albeit slow) but food delivered was fairly subpar - burnt calzones that really missed the mark. Wouldn’t recommend.
3,Palorma, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had the calzone fully loaded..  It was amazing & for €9 it was a great price. Service was spot on although it was Monday so not busy. Would Defo use again
