4,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Such a great place to sit, eat & have drinks. Food was delicious. Service was super. We sat right on the water , watching to boats go by. Definitely will be back"
5,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Comfortable and convenient place to drink beer, cocktails and wine as it has an outdoor space near the water and reasonable prices. It is close to the Tulip Museum. The beers come in the option of tap or bottle but there are not a lot of to …"
6,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy place, good food. We were there 1st of january and they had 3 Main dishes (normally they have more on the Menu): Stamppot, Angus Burger, ""holy"" Ravioli. I had the burger and it was tasty (with cheese and bacon :D ) staff was quick and friendly !"
7,Spanjer en van Twist, 1 star ,6 months ago,Not good service at all. The waiter voice tone was agressive and not nice at all. We didn’t know we couldn’t be 4 persons in the same table and the way he told us was unrespectful and also didn’t want to attend us anymore. He brought us the check when we just got our drinks and us ask to leave.
8,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cosy and nice restaurant. I really enjoyed the meal, it was delicious. The stuff was very nice and helpful. I'm giving 4 stars because I'd like to have a glass of water with my coffee."

11,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great location for a calm and peaceful rest.

13,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice food right in the middle of the canals, with attentive staff. Beautiful top seating space available, and very well located in the middle of the Jordaan."
14,Spanjer en van Twist, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Ridiculous staff. Great if you love long waits on the terrace, menu items not available, rude staff and gross restrooms. Coffee was mediocre and the cake was overpriced and not fresh. No toiletpaper or handtowels, restrooms unsanitary. Never going back."
15,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is so special!!! The area where it is is just amazing, not too crowded like close to the red light district. If you need a time to relax and enjoy the city next to the canal, this is the perfect place."
16,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Been here in 2018 for the burritos, came back in 2021 and it’s as good as I remember it! Service needs some improvement though."
17,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Quiet breakfast spot on the canal to watch the boats glide by. Menu is simple and satisfying.

19,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had breakfast and got service and good coffee.

21,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Various coffees are offered. Has upstairs room
22,Spanjer en van Twist, 1 star ,a year ago,"It used to be so nice here. But cold drinks were warm. Bitter bollen over cooked and judging by the dust on the toilet seat, they have never cleaned it, especially for covid.. sorry i won't be back.."
23,Spanjer en van Twist, 1 star ,6 months ago,Worst service in Amsterdam. The waiter was not amicable at all and had a horrible attitude.
24,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The terrace has an excellent view, it's really cozy to have a refreshing beer there in the summer. They even have an unbrella over it in case of an unexpected rain. …"

26,Spanjer en van Twist, 1 star ,2 years ago,Nice burger here! 2020-03-14. Sorry I am flabbergasted as we experienced something really strange (after 5 years in a row) over here which now makes me to change the rating from 4 stars to 1 star! We ordered our meal and somehow the …
27,Spanjer en van Twist, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, good service that was slightly let down by the ambiance and the dated look inside. The ground floor area just felt dark and uninviting which is not a first good impression. If you do drop by, try to head to the upstairs sitting area which is brighter and has views of the canals outside."
28,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome canal views with outdoor seating, the buildings history is as old as most of its surroundings. A must to visit if you enjoy a cultural refined Dutch bar."
29,Spanjer en van Twist, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Spanjer en van Twist is a nice place for lunch under the trees and of course, people watching. It's located right next to one of those side canals, so you'll see tour boats, paddle boats, and all sorts of boats go by. …"
30,Spanjer en van Twist, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty late lunch with friendly service. Caesar salad was good (except maybe the whole anjovis in it) and beef burritos would’ve been great but were served lukewarm. Prosecco served warm so lost points for those. I might visit again if in the neighborhood and hungry...
31,Spanjer en van Twist, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food and locale is very nice. Beers overpriced. Service is terribly slow and not flexible on the terrace, they wouldn't even let us rearrange the chairs to face each other on the water. We moved tables and still had to wait 45 mins for 3 of …"
32,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great little spot. Dropped in here to get out of the rain and found a nice chill spot in Amsterdam. The food is actually tasty. The waiter is genuinely nice. The view is perfect.
33,Spanjer en van Twist, 1 star ,3 years ago,It took 20 minutes to get greeted at the table and another hour plus to get food (and we were just a small party with 2 adults and 1 kid). This was the case we noticed for all the tables in the restaurant.The servers didn't care and were MIA most of the time. Food was decent but not worth the wait.
34,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food is tasty and the price is reasonable. The staff was wonderful. If you visit try to sit in the  balcony as the view of the canal is beautiful. Overall would definitely visit again.
35,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Upstairs by the window is the best spot in Amsterdam to while away a cold afternoon with a book or a friend. In summer you won't find a better place to sit outside. Food is good, service excellent."
36,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was rainy and we ducked in for dinner because it was busy but not packed.  We ended up having a really delightful meal with friendly service and a reasonable price.   The whole Dorado fish was excellent - perfectly baked with fresh, al …"

39,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super delicious. We had the salad with pumpkin & sweet potato chips,  baklava and the Camembert. And you can sit right at the waterfront."
40,Spanjer en van Twist, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I was there just to have a coke and everything was good! They have chairs down at the channel so when the sun is shining it is just perfect to sit there and enjoy the view! Lovely place!
41,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Great pie and food in general, sweet location and lovely waiter. They also have the laziest cat i have ever seen: it sleeps on chairs and doesnt want to leave its spot. Lift her, put her on your knees and she fall asleep there while you eat :-)"
42,Spanjer en van Twist, 5 stars ,8 years ago,High recommeded place!!. Great food in reasonable price in a very beautiful location.

47,Spanjer en van Twist, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Food was good, but they were scamming the tourists. Charging evening meal prices for daytime menus. All surprised that it could happen but so clearly an act. Expensive and dishonest. Avoid"
48,Spanjer en van Twist, 1 star ,6 years ago,overall good. but a shitty male server (medium length hair) raises his voice and being rude whn we had a question. he shouldn't in service industry. worst experience in amsterdam. the rest of the staffs were ok
49,Spanjer en van Twist, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Nice seating views on the canal. Don't come if you're in a rush. My toastie took 40 minutes to toast.
50,Spanjer en van Twist, 2 stars ,10 years ago,"Disgusting diner, but a nice terrace and fine drinks. They serve dry and tasteless prefab food. Lettuce, tomato's and cucumber are considered as 'grilled vegetables' in a salad..."
