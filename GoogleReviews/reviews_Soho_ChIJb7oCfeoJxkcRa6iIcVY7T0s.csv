0,Soho, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Cutest club in the street. the bartenders are super friendly and they made my night.
Cocktails on point, service is great.
Will definitely come back"
1,Soho, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The bar is an interesting one, but probably is better not to attend in the happy hours, cause its getting crowded. Its mostly a gay bar, where you feel comfortable. The downside is the you have to pay for the toilet. The prices are high as Amsterdam prices are. I recommend it for the music and atmosphere. Nice bartenders."
2,Soho, 5 stars ,a month ago,Ricardo is the best waiter we love doing shots with him. He‚Äôs the nicest. Love it here
3,Soho, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Great music selection and overall location, though staff is a bit arrogant.
The cherry on top is that they actually ask you to pay to use their toilet, regardless of you ordering, drinking or spending the whole night there. I find it ridiculous and way below the line of decency."
4,Soho, 4 stars ,5 months ago,A nice gay bar with a very lively dance music. You will have a great time here for sure. Many thanks to the great bar guy wi try a long hair in a bun and a long necklace he wore yesterday. We felt so welcomed because of him!
5,Soho, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Levi is the best!!! H/she‚Äôs so good, very welcoming and such a great host. Made me feel at home, absolutely love him/her company and vibe. I wish s/he was at the door!!! ‚Ä¶"
6,Soho, 5 stars ,a month ago,I had a good time thanks to the nice bartenders. See you guys on my next visit to Amsterdam!
7,Soho, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We love Ricardooooooo!!!! We love him, he is so social and he is so kind :) we love doijg shots with him"
8,Soho, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Always a good time, the crew is amazing they really know how to make a night special"
9,Soho, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Stay away from this bar! The service is very unfriendly, drinks are overpriced, and music/sound is way too loud everywhere to enjoy. The idea is of a gay bar, but it feels more like a tourist gay trap, or an Erasmus party for straight students. Much better authentic gay bars in the city."
10,Soho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Super great atmosphere. Everyone so nice, specially our waiter Facu I think it was his name. The food and drinks amazing! I am coming back for sure"
11,Soho, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Ricardo is the best , he is so kind"
12,Soho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"An amazing experience on the Regulierstraat! Good ambiance, nice drinks, gooooood shots and great staff! The outfits are the best and definetly the queen of the street during this past month.
Love everything about it üòç"
13,Soho, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"Amazing staff, mixed crowd, free entry, always a great night!"
14,Soho, 1 star ,8 months ago,"I was there this weekend, after covid you think the employees will be happy to have people again. The  was an unfriendly atmosphere , the two guys who work there , they looked tired , very unfriendly and really cocky. I saw that Bar in front really crowded and not wonder why. Pity such a bar with such an employees."
15,Soho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I went the last week for First time and I really like the place. The atmosphere was good and the music too!
16,Soho, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Very unfriendly stuff. They told me they don‚Äôt have cocktails walked away and told me to reconsider. Then we had to order twice and they told me we‚Äôre annoying.
17,Soho, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Took some clients for a night out in Amsterdam.
Got a bit more boozey than expected. Took them here on a Friday night. Atmosphere was electric. Drinks were reasonable price and music was good. ‚Ä¶"
18,Soho, 1 star ,4 months ago,Drunk employee was harassing customers! Good music but they need to correct their staff!

21,Soho, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"LGBT friendly, but fries took long."
22,Soho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,beautiful place and the attention of its waiters! Fun music and good vibes! Love it! üòç
23,Soho, 1 star ,2 years ago,I would like to give even less stars. Staff wasn‚Äôt nice and drinks are way better elsewhere. The stairs to the top are ridiculously tin and dangerous but when it‚Äôs fuller and taking into account that the restrooms are upstairs it gets ‚Ä¶
24,Soho, 1 star ,8 months ago,"It‚Äôs overcrowded, the stuff is super unfriendly, inside there is no ventilation at all and the security in the entrance was letting people in without covid tests. I do not recommend it."
25,Soho, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great music and nice place to go out always!
26,Soho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favorite gay bar in Amsterdam! Great place to lounge with your friends! Especially during happy hour. Place to see beautiful people and be seen. Great atmosphere, I highly recommend."
27,Soho, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is great and the staff are very friendly. However, the fact that you have to spend 50 cents to go to the toilet after consuming drinks at the bar is abusive and ridiculous.  Any bar where you are consuming should provide with a free available toilet. I have never seen this in my life."
28,Soho, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Weird that you had to pay for the toilets but it was only 50c so it could have been worse. Music was great, atmosphere was great and the place itself was clearly very popular on a Friday night. Was a little cramped but not too bad, drinks ‚Ä¶"
29,Soho, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a place to meet up with friends and have a drink. I'm not sure it can be more than that. I know this place since 2005, gradually but surely its losing its charm. The sound quality is bad, but it's biggest advantage is that it's ‚Ä¶"
30,Soho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice Club, Heinecken 0,25l for 3,70 ‚Ç¨ We arrived on 11 pm, but the big party starts on midnight. Good mixed music and mixed people. No entry fee. We had a lot of fun. Costs for the Toilets 0,50‚Ç¨ but its ok for me. ‚Ä¶"
31,Soho, 1 star ,a year ago,We came here tonight and we were seated all the time to another place which wouldn't be that much a problem if not some security was yelling several times because they didn't know what the other commanded us. ‚Ä¶
32,Soho, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice and cool place where you can drink a pint and dance.
33,Soho, 1 star ,a year ago,"The place itself is nice but the atmosphere is terrible, all the workers are rude to the people. The bartenders the security and everyone who works there makes you feel uncomfortable."
34,Soho, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I've had a great time here! Specially for dancing, however towards the later hours of the night the music gets lame. Everytime I've gone it's crowded and lively, people are very friendly and everyone's having a blast. Just go and own the dancefloor!"
35,Soho, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I'm shocked. I Have to register here my BAD EXPERIENCE at SOHO Amsterdam. I was in the line awaiting my time to enter to the club, I turn back to my friends, who were just a few meters of the line, walking to the entrance direction, when ‚Ä¶"
36,Soho, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I had a great time with my friends there, music and interior were fantastic, a little too hot.
Unfortunately the toilet lady (twenty-something big girl) intentionally stole my ‚Ä¶"
37,Soho, 1 star ,4 years ago,"About two weeks ago We wanted to get into to wait there for some friends. The security agent was extremely aggressive without any reason just because my boy friend hat a bottle of mineral water in his bag! Finally we come back astonished: people go to pubs to have good time, not to to feel like in a police station!"
38,Soho, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Lots of positive energy and fun in this place.  Good music and beautiful people. The toilet is on the top floor and believe me you need to pay.
39,Soho, 1 star ,2 years ago,very pathetic bar with would be best place but its not... payed wardrobe and toilet where you will stay in line about 30-40 min... glamorous bartenders who never watch to clients. you can stay to wait your order 30-40-50 min but they will ‚Ä¶
40,Soho, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Just the worst. Old sound system they use to play music your parents get excited about when it comes on the radio. Typically Dutch bar staff: oblivious, barely able to serve beer or wine, definitely incapable of mixing a drink. ‚Ä¶"
41,Soho, 1 star ,2 years ago,Witnessed two patrons physically assaulted by security guard.  They appeared to be minding their own business with other friends when the guard began yelling and pushing one to the door and hit another on the back of the neck forcing them ‚Ä¶
42,Soho, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place and music. Fair prices... bar staff very friendly but security I wasnt happy. I wasnt even drinking when I was passing the door and a security grab my arms saying something in Dutch for no reason sending me back to the pavment. ‚Ä¶
43,Soho, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Good night out but shooters are watered down for sure hahah
44,Soho, 5 stars ,a month ago,Nice environment and cocktails
45,Soho, 1 star ,2 years ago,These guys will make you stand up and take away your seat... first time I‚Äôve seen that! Terrible service. Additions you have to pay for WC!? ‚Ä¶
46,Soho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Amazing drinks, service and atmosphere."
47,Soho, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Cute neighborhood but the drinks were not it.
48,Soho, 1 star ,6 years ago,"Being refused to get in because i was wearing sportswear.

For years i had no any problem with my dress to get in but probably they changed ‚Ä¶"
49,Soho, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The bar is huge and very nicely decorated. The music though is too mainstream for a gay bar.. Very very very bad you absolutely need to have change to go to the bathroom!!!
50,Soho, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The stairwell going to the third floor should be illegal as it is and accident waiting to happen. In additional if you keep asking for cash to pay for the wardrobe and the toiled (which is ridiculous in 2020) you should be ready to have change, not short changing the customer."
51,Soho, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The bar staff are full with vain attitude.
We know they're big queens but they shouldn't forget that the customers are the Kings. :-) ‚Ä¶"
52,Soho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place, definitely going back again soon!"
53,Soho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The staff is friendly and the music is good!
54,Soho, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very rude manager. When he think your drinking a beer on his terrace which you bought some where else (what was not the case. I spend that day already for 24,- euro in his bar) he pull your glass out of your hand and throw it on the street. Very rude. Even in the case it was bought somewhere else you dont do that."
55,Soho, 1 star ,3 years ago,"40 min queue to check coat in, same queue for the toilet. Have to pay to use the toilet each time... completely let the venue down."
56,Soho, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Awful music, strange prices and a charge to use the toilet! I‚Äôm not even sure if that‚Äôs legal! A gay bar, but felt like it was purely in name. No heart or soul, just full of women and randomers."
57,Soho, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Nice but ridiculous that customers have to pay for the bathroom
58,Soho, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best place ever, so much fun ü•≥"
59,Soho, 1 star ,a year ago,"Very disappointed. If you have other options, try a different establishment. They are not customer friendly could care less what you are spending. They do not care about repeat business, with so many other options choose something different."
60,Soho, 1 star ,3 years ago,I canceled all my plans I just got home ... cause of the security guys they didn‚Äôt let me in they said  I don‚Äôt look gay enough ... !!!! Excuse me ?!?! HOW SHOULD I IMPROVE IM GAY !!!?‚Äô  that‚Äôs silly now I understand why it‚Äôs empty only few people ... it‚Äôs because if the security is sooooooo much guys we are having fun here
61,Soho, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The shitiest place to go: awful waiting times, overpriced drinks, cheapest dj possible (talks over music all the time, 45s tracks with romanian remixes...). Don't go there I said!"
62,Soho, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The bar itself not so bad, the staff however is very rude and not attentive at all. More concerned about themselves than serving the customers."
63,Soho, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Went for Pride. Paid ‚Ç¨10 entry. Then was charged a further ‚Ç¨1 for bathroom use....? Won't go again.
64,Soho, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, good food but NOT ALLOWED to take pics of the place/ ourselves/ even the FOOD!!!! even the food on the table! Doesn't really make sense!"
65,Soho, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best gay bar in town!  Great atmosphere and wonderful staff makes for a nice night out in Amsterdam.  Love this place.
66,Soho, 1 star ,6 years ago,"One of the pathetic experience. Body guard at front gate is very racist and greedy. He allows random people and stop suddenly without giving any reason for it. One incident, all of my friend went inside and they stopped me for no reason."
67,Soho, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Reallly arrogant waiter and rude , not nice to customers , I don‚Äôt recommend it"
68,Soho, 4 stars ,a year ago,"+ best space in the LGBT+ street

73,Soho, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Boorish barman. He ignored me 3 times after asking a beer. Then, he served another guy on my left side.
I'm speechless."
74,Soho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not only a gay bar, but a great place where everyone can celebrate freedom"
75,Soho, 1 star ,3 years ago,Worst service. My wife and I simply wanted to be in a more accepting atmosphere and felt the exact opposite. Would not recommend.
76,Soho, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great night great atmosphere and very reasonable price for a pint of Heineken, I recommend for a night out before a club"
77,Soho, 1 star ,a year ago,You have to pay for the toilet even if you spend your evening there. They are rude on this.
78,Soho, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Boring. It takes for ever to get a very expensive drink to be able to stand which is probably the most basic club full of no-dancing dull gays of Amsterdam.
79,Soho, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Saturday night, place is totally empty but staff had time to laugh in my face because I didn't order alcohol. Terrible!"
80,Soho, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great music and nice waiters. But you need to pay in the toilets

93,Soho, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing!!! This is really the place to be!! Great  staff and really nice vibe!!
94,Soho, 1 star ,4 years ago,Horrible place. Friend was not allowed to get in because of his clothing....
95,Soho, 1 star ,4 years ago,Aggressive stuff. Commercial. Str8 place pretending to be gay friendly
