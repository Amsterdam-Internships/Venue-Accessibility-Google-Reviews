There was more men than women by a decent amonts, but next time we'll try going on couple's night and it should be better!"
1,Sameplace, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Perfect Swingers Club! This place is AMAZING and about a 18-20 walk from Dam Square. The reviews made me nervous but what was there to lose by checking it out for myself? Couples were welcomed with a cover charge of 10 euro and we had to ‚Ä¶
2,Sameplace, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Wouldn‚Äôt advise. No hot people and the drinks are incredibly expensive. The place is pretty small but they have a little dungeon. Left with a very bad impression of something dodgy and dirty. The guy working the entrance didn‚Äôt know what consent meant...
3,Sameplace, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Contacted Sameplace before visit to make sure we were welcome on the day. Got refused at the door, no proper explanation given. Came back later, still got told that we couldn't come in. Not much of a warm welcome to Amsterdam.. plus it was my birthday! p.s. we weren't even high or drunk, bah!"

5,Sameplace, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place,
I didn t find drink expensive at all, and the staff is cool.
For that kind of place is normal that the door man not let in 100 % of people.
So i would recommand highly."
6,Sameplace, 5 stars ,4 years ago,always feel welcome in this club. one of my favourite place to hang out when in amsterdam. good place to chill... have fun... drinks... friendly atmosphere and great staffüòú
7,Sameplace, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It‚Äôs hit and miss in terms of crowd. I‚Äôve had nice experiences and zero experiences. Depends on the crowd. Bar is nothing fancy. Down to earth.
8,Sameplace, 1 star ,4 years ago,The man who owns or just bartends the place is really aggressive. Drink prices are really expensive. I would avoid this place and just host a few couples at your home.
