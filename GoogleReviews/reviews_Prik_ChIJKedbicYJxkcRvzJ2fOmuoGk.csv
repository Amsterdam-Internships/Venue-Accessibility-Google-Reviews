28,Prik, 1 star ,a year ago,"The bar is great, but the customers, especially youngsters, are loud and terrible. Asked a couple of loud chaps behind me to quiet down as they were wearing my ear off, not only did they not quiet down, they also threw away mine and my friend's beef bitterballen. We didn't see them doing it was definitely them!"

38,Prik, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly, local bar that was busy but mot crowded on a Friday night. Really quickly bar service and reasonably priced.
