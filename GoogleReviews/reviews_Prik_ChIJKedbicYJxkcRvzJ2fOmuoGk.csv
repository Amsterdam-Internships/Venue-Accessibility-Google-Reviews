28,Prik, 1 star ,a year ago,"The bar is great, but the customers, especially youngsters, are loud and terrible.

We didn't see them doing it was definitely them!"

37,Prik, 2 stars ,a year ago,I am a neighbour so a bit biased possibly. But I am really fed up with the constant screaming on the terrace. People are sitting next to eachother but still feel the need to yell like lunatics all night. ‚Ä¶
38,Prik, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly, local bar that was busy but mot crowded on a Friday night. Really quickly bar service and reasonably priced.
