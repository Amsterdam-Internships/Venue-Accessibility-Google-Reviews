0,Kebab Corner, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Unfortunately there was no hand soap, or hand sanitizer. The meat had more nerves and fat then proper meat. The owner is very nice, but the cleanliness is 0."
1,Kebab Corner, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Food is great and the sauce is better. I went here once and I‚Äôve been craving it ever since. Went again and it was just as good. Highly recommend

5,Kebab Corner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Large and tasty, yet a bit fatty, chicken shawarma plate or roll at a decent price. Staff is just friendly enough to make your experience pleasant. If you looking for a quick Oriental meal, this is your place."
6,Kebab Corner, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Most disgusting garlic sauce ive ever had, and my d√∂ner kebab tasted really bad, ive been that day to another place and the d√∂ner kebab was really nice.

7,Kebab Corner, 1 star ,2 years ago,"very bad experience, we asked for the kebad without salad and he put it on us and he did not want to change it, in fact we did not change it we had to remove the salad us, the lamb tasted weird and strong, the potatoes with a lot of salt despite  Say without salt, pieces of gummy and tasteless pizzas."

13,Kebab Corner, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The owner is really rude.
