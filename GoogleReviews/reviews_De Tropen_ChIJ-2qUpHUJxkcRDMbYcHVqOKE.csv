0,De Tropen, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"The restaurant looks very nice, and it's conveniently located in the museum.

The food is alright, portions are quite small. No vegan option but a couple of vegetarian ones."
1,De Tropen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"De Tropen is a perfect spot for a coffee(meeting) in the morning, a delicious lunch or dinner. The interior is impressive and the terrace has a great view over the Oosterpark. It's very easy to access through station Muiderpoort if you are from out of town."
2,De Tropen, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice ambience, but sloppy service, disappointing menu and bad coffee (mini cappuccino). Waited 30 minutes for a croissant that did not arrive after all."
3,De Tropen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great quality but limited choices for coeliacs.

Just tucking into a very tasty sweet potato salad as I type... ‚Ä¶"

9,De Tropen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice spot to take a break during the day but also to have a snack or full meal when taking a break from the Tropen museum. ‚Ä¶
10,De Tropen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice cafe/bar/restaurant. It's very child friendly as it has a kids area behind the bar. Inside it's a bit dark but it has quite a big terrace outside. It was not very busy when I visited it around 11:00 which was nice. The staff was kind and helpful as well. I'll probb return here in the near future.
11,De Tropen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Second time for me during Lazy Sunday, this time with a Jazz DJ, singer and fluteplayer. Very relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff. However, there was one waitress who did not understand at all what I was asking and returned to me with items ‚Ä¶"

15,De Tropen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Restaurant De Tropen can be accessed from within the Tropenmuseum. But you can also access it from the outside if you are not visiting the museum. The lunch food is a healthy Indonesian fusion cuisine. Service was quick and friendly.

17,De Tropen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A hidden secret: not far away from City center and soooo relaxed. And green: located in the Oosterpark. Beautiful historical building (back entrance of Tropenmuseum). Moreover: they serve excellent pok√© bowls üëçüèΩüëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
