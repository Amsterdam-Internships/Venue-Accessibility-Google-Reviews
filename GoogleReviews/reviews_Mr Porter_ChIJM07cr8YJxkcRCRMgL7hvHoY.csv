1,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"This was our last dinner before lockdown. It was very good! I loved the ribeye steak, mac and cheese and lobster! The yellow tail starter was alright, it was a bit too sour for my preference. The service was amazing! I hope to come back soon!"
2,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"There are numerous Argentinian  steak restaurants in the immediate vicinity of Dam Square,  most with identical menus. If it's a New York style steakhouse that you crave, you have to check-out Mr. Porter, a rooftop restaurant on the upper …"

9,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The place it's nice, also super crowded and with loud music. We had a reservation but we waited for our table more than 20 minutes, It was an weird situation cause we had to ask several times the waiters when we will get our table. The W …"
10,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was good, the baby back ribs was tender and the meat is dry-aged. The service from the waitress was also good and she was friendly. The ambience is calm and not loud. The food did take long though, the waitress said it would come …"

12,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing combination of perfect food, urban view and waiters work. We have tried 2 types of steaks, 3 salads, 3 snacks and 3 desserts. Everything except sweet potato was very delicious and beautiful. And also you should try Bloody Mary!"
13,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A wonderful place to spend the night at. After years we found a restaurant where they know how to cook steak properly. We had 3 appetizers: Octopus salad, aubergine, and zucchini. A Porter steak which is a T-bone cut cooked to perfection. …"
14,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Don't know where to start,  everything was a series of perfection from the minute we walked in. From the hostess, to our waitress,  to the food,  to the after drinks e.t.c,  e.t.c,  e.t.c.  We were a party of three and enjoyed a variety of …"

Went there as a couple to have a special evening as Mr Porter's website clearly …"
18,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Came here for lunch without the crowd, actually quite empty.  Ordered rib eye and sea bream.  The aged steak had kind of a smoky flavor, not bad, but not outstanding.  The sea bream was fresh, but had lots of spices, too much, to the point that they masked any natural fish flavor.  So, not impressed!  The view was good!"
19,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Enjoyed this a lot! The meat was delicious, the waiter was cool and almost knew what we wanted when we wanted it. We were seated at the bar watching the bartender mix cocktails, he was really skilled and it was entertaining even to watch it. It was an overall great experience. It was pricey, but well worth it as that food was amazing!"

23,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"First time having shared dining with steak, rather unusual type of dining which works pretty good. Downside is the meat is precut and this gets cold pretty quick. The staff are very friendly. But the food presentation and quality isn't …"
24,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice top end steak restaurant. Plus: Steak was great, well cooked and came with mustard menu. Staff were amazing. Negative: chips literally no better than oven chips...top end I expect triple cooked or at least proper cut"
25,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Breakfast was so good! For €35 a person, you can devour so many options. Fruits, meats, bread, dessert, assorted juices, and a la carte meal options. Closes breakfast at 11am, but they don't kick you out they just stop serving. We ordered …"

35,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Fancy steakhouse with a great view of Amsterdam. There is a rooftop balcony with sofa where you can have a cocktail. But the food is not worth your money. Mr. Porter steak of 1.1kg was ok and the side dishes were very small and pricey. The …

39,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"(E) Great food! (D) Delightful Israeli chef, best view in XXX, and a nicely designed place (brass rules + restrooms from Death Star). Funny enough to mention: the ""mustard menu""."
40,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I am not even sure where to start with this amazing place, so I will start with the ambience and views.  Situated atop a hotel, it has the most amazing views from the water of the whole harbor.  It is a steakhouse serving top of the line …"
41,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"It’s worth a visit if you pass by Amsterdam, better to have a booking, It’s a kind of luxurious restaurant, it has a good view and atmosphere and restaurant very nice, main menu consist of steak steak and seafood, appetizers  and the starters have a good choice and don’t miss that focaccia it is really delicious."
42,Mr Porter, 1 star ,a month ago,It took 20 minutes for the waiter to ask about drinks and the filet mignon was overcooked and dry (pro-tip: you don't need to cook a dry aged steak so long👍)
43,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, carnivores will be happy, started with a lunchtime booking and left at 18.30hrs. Relaxed by the fire and listened to the DJ who played a great selection of music."
44,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We were a party of 4 adults, so we ordered 2 starters, 2 meats, 4 sides, a few bottles of wine, dessert, and after dinner drinks. The restaurant is quite expensive for the amount of food. The sharing concept is a cool idea, but Im thinking …"
45,Mr Porter, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place with a great view, but a tad pretentious and the staff is extremely slow and unfriendly. For the price you pay, I don;t think it’s great, but you’re paying for the view and to be sen there. It turns into a ‘look at me here’ place …"
46,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,a year ago,I arrived many times at this restaurant absolutely unnotiertes which is said because this place is on higher level. On the other hand I was also hosted very nicely. Cocktails here are very good. Love the ambiance and the highlight is music. Keep it up
47,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing restaurant. One of the best if not the best steakhouse in Amsterdam and whole netherlands. The view is amazing day and night. Amazing variety of different meat cuts. The menu is as long as it should be. The staff has knowledge and can help you accordingly. Do not hesitate to try different tastes and dishes.
48,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing food! Price is ok! Service was very good but only after the manager figured out our waitress was not taking of our table. Anyway we got some free appetizer! Very well recommended!
49,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, slightly overpriced, excellent location however with some candles could have been more cosy. Very trendy place."
50,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Taste the slow cook lamb it's a must! They only reserve tables for dinner for 2h. Dinner starts at 6 and you can wait in the rooftop bar until then which offers great atmosphere. Order a cocktail while waiting, you won't make a mistake."
51,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Superb experience! We were first a bit hesitant since it is located in the W Hotel, but food and atmosphere were amazing. If you are looking for a fine, meaty dinner in Amsterdam, go here! Great views from the terrace!"

55,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The service was top-notch! The food was delicious and especially the dessert, a bit pricy though. Overall had a nice dinner!"
56,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice but no dress code , I over did it and there was people in jeans and t-shirts .the chips where frozen steak cut and for the price you would expect proper chips. Staff friendly and polite but not on the ball. In my opinion a Michelin star is a long way off!! Which upset me as we paid over £500 for four adults."
57,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent ambiance and service. The steaks were soft and tasty althought a bit overpriced. We were fine splitting the beef and the side dishes.
58,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent menu, waiter recommended the leek and we ordered it again it was so good. Very busy and got shifted from our table which wasn't great as we were a large party. But if you in the mood for great steak go here."
59,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really high-end steaks restaurant. Went in 2018 and at that time I could get a 350g ribeye at 39€ and a BIG side of fries for 5,9€. With the steak you get a steak sauce and a spoon of special seasoned mustards of you choosing. The quality …"

63,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Fantastic Lobster, best I have had in years.   Amazing view and ambiance!  Some staff members where not the most accomodating telling us to wait far too long for coffee and food while at times being somewhat unresponsive.    My family and I …"
64,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Outstanding service, tasty tapas and delicious french rosé. The terrasse is a great spot for aperitif. Prices are a bit high but its all worth it when the service and quality are so good. Strongly recommended."

70,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had super fun on New Year's Eve. The bar service was the only thing that let it down as our drinks order went astray twice. Excellent location and the food was exceptional.

74,Mr Porter, 1 star ,a year ago,Overpriced and overhyped. Food is just OK but €40 for the kind of rib eye they serve is definitely not worth it. I’ve had better rib eye’s for less. The staff is friendly but not able to handle a full house. Dishes for most of the tables …
75,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 months ago,good place fine dining dont miss try it. make reservation before go there
76,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was okay not to special! Nice atmosphere, however music is way to loud couldn’t hear the waitress nor my friends.. But the young lady who served us could have done way better for the price we are paying... She didn’t try to menage to …"

92,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,a year ago,"We went for drinks, the cocktails were quite good, timing was really awful, started bad, but got worse every drink. The best was the reaction of the service to our feedback on the timing, you pay for the drinks, not for the service, they …"
93,Mr Porter, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Not worth the money. Food was upscale, though the waitress was a disaster. Later on, a young group of 5 guys was sat next to us who were obviously drunk. They were only up for more drinks, did not have food at all and also started to light up cigars. Quite weird in a fine dining restaurant, even though it was outside on the terrace."
94,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Excellent! The food was great and the crew was kind
95,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food and service, we loved the showing kitchen"

We celebrated a bachelorette party, arrived late for our breakfast but were still served - even additional complementary dishes. Elfa was amazingly attentive and we really enjoyed her service!"
98,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,9 months ago,The food is amazing but definitely overpriced. You can definitely find beter food for 2/3 of the price. The coconut desert was worth it though.
99,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow, my boyfriend and I enjoyed our experience here much more than the Duchess. We booked a table last minute and was seated at the bar. Our server was super attentive and kind to us. The food was absolutely fantastic, the meats cooked …"

111,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing ambiance, great food, every course a succes"
112,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice roof terrace on which we enjoyed a delicious selection of starters and lovely cocktails. We also ordered a selection of steaks to share and each one of the cuts was flavoursome and well cooked. I had to order my espresso after dinner 4-5 times before I actually got one which was a bit annoying.

118,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic food and fantastic atmosphere. The Mr Porter (1100g+) is probably the best steak I have ever had the pleasure to share as it is no way you can solo it. The fancy cocktails with pansies floating in them shouldn't be missed.
119,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, music a bit loud for conversation"
120,Mr Porter, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Claimed that the steak was well done instead of medium rare because it was sitting for 10 minutes while we argued that the steak wasn’t cooked properly. …

134,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We really enjoyed this place. Cool, upbeat vibe and really good food. They recommend family style, which is what we did. The wagyu was well worth it and we tried the feuille de brick which turned out to be one of our favorite dishes there."
135,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great meats and accessories, plus fabulous cocktails. But considering the price range that only makes sense. Only remark would be to have nicer hosts, our waitress on the other hand was beyond friendly. Atmosphere is more pre-party than …"
136,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely Views and cool seating light even on a dark grey day.. cool W vibe music. Nice variety snacks each time.. pleasent pre drinks with friends option. Coffee cold not to my standards several times. …
137,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I am not a huge fan of hotel breakfasts unless they are free.  This one definitely wasn't.  I mean the person who checked me into my room even told me that as good as the breakfast is I'd probably want to get it somewhere else for a better …

142,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice design and views of the city on the roof of the W hotel. But the place is very expensive for what you get. Rather small portions. Meat is very good, but really not worth the cost. Music is loud, so don't expect to be able to have a group conversation."
143,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty darn good steak, perfectly seasoned and cooked and the gravy that came with it was yummy too. We’ve been here twice and were happy both times, the lounge next door is nice for cocktails too."
144,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"PROS: Amazing menu. Top negroni! We had the Brik, the Mr Porter steak (to share... it was humongous!), the cauliflower Mac n cheese, grilled asparagus and shishito peppers as we well as the chocolate fondant. The entire meal was delicious! …"
145,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Beautiful scenery and the food was very nice and tasty plus the server was very nice and helpful.
146,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"After an appalling service in the skylounge.  We came here and I have to say the staff were beyond incredible and helpful. They explained the cocktails to us, gave us recommendations and were quick serving us . The atmosphere is so chilled …"
147,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best steak I’ve ever had! Would definitely recommend.
148,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Way over priced and even though the staff was super nice the service wasn't so good and we had to wait almost 2 hours for our steak
149,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent food, but more expensive than it was worth. Also, we ordered a 90euro steak, that we couldn't finish since we ordered too much food, and the wouldn't let us take it home. We had to throw away 70euros worth of meat. This is the first restaurant I've been to in the world that doesn't allow you to have takeaway."
150,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Host service is awful. I requested a table for a very special ocassion. Way in advanced I made the reservation and on the same day I call in order to ensure that we would get a nice table with a view, however the two hostesses there didn't …"
151,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Modern and stylish steakhouse in Amsterdam with a fantastic view. In addition to eating there is bar counters and an almost club like atmosphere (without the really loud music) in the evening. Great place and amazing food!
152,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, location and view. Also very good service, and decor was interesting. Obviously the restaurant is very expensive... but the only disappointment was that after about 20.00 the music became very loud, which in combination with the poor acoustics made conversation very hard."
153,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this restaurant! Great food selection (especially the fois gras), excellent mixology, such great location/view. I absolutely enjoyed the dine just as much as the music/DJ in the bar next to restaurant. A true gem in Amsterdam."
154,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was an awesome food experience
Unique flavours and excellent service. Special credits to waiter Claudie ( I do not know if I write correct) the guy behind the bar, for the discrete and caring behaviour"
155,Mr Porter, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very expensive for what you get back. Paying 200 Euro for 2 person on a diner is really overprice for what you get back. By the way, the meat came cold, shame on the chef that send it out. You not expecting a piece of meat of 50 Euro to be …"
156,Mr Porter, 1 star ,2 years ago,"BYOK
It means bring your own knife.
The people there seem to be interested to invest in expensive knives instead of …"
157,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Mr. Portet is the closest thing to a real steak house experience in all of Amsterdam. It has a proper aging room and nice cut and sides selection. There's also a very nice lounge with delicious cocktails if you're in the mood to keep the …
158,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent food, as usual! But this time the service was slow and inconsistent.  A very long time for a latecomer to get his drink and more than an hour between the various ""starter"" courses and the main event - the delicious steaks."
159,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice atmosphere in the heart of Amsterdam next to its royal palace
160,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Beautiful location in the centre of it all. A place to remind. We had a small bite and some drinks and enjoyed it a lot. Service could be a little sharper. But overall great. We will come back here next visit.
161,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The food was excellent. Good vibe and friendly staff. They only forgot to seat us and to bring drinks two times. Maybe just the wrong table but besides that it was great
162,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great restorant. Goose liver one of the best I ate. The Rib eye was Amazing. Wine excellent . Atmosphere perfect. Service great. Overall very very recommended .
163,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Atmosphere 10/10. Service 10/10. Steak 10/10, sea food salad 10/10. Only slight surprise was the polenta. It wasn't really what Pena should be, more like pureed corn. …"
164,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice view from the side we were, service was nice for a Dutch bad standard,  the meat quality was nice, but not the best. Wine was ok, the cocktail at the end was not good quality. In few words good, but could be better for the price and location. Anyways, good job and try to improve more."
165,Mr Porter, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Highly overrated. Food was cold, service ordinary. Steaks. Have had much better steaks"
166,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Phenomenal wagyu steak. A must try for anyone!

169,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Mr. Porter is the steak restaurant on the 6th floor of the trendy W Amsterdam hotel, Exchange side. At first the prices are rather intimidating, until you discover most dishes are large enough to be shared. Then the cost is back to normal …"
170,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is simply one of the most elegant places to come in Amsterdam. I can not recommend it highly enough. A true hidden gem. The service, cocktails and food are utterly divine!:)"
171,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I've only been to the bar at the top floor. Good location. Great 90s house/pop music. Too dark, not cozy, wannabe classy. I paid 18 euros for a miniscule amount of dark rum."
172,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place. Good sweet potato and asparagus 👌🏻
173,Mr Porter, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"overall experience average.
Prices are crazily expensive for what the offer.cocktails were good and main as well but the rest not.i wouldnt be going back.with the amount of money i paid …"
174,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Simply amazing steaks. The wagyu is out of the world. Hands down the best starters in Amsterdam. Great wine. And mind blowing desserts to finish off. Top of the line!!!!
175,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Memorable from start to finish.  They provide a wonderful plate of freshly cooked bread to start which is cooked in a special oven at the front of the kitchen. The tomahawk short rib was particularly memorable.  Service also excellent.
176,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Very good steak.  Not cheap. Great ambiance
177,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent, if you are carnivourus don't miss out this. Classy, good service, smiling servers, excellent food with very satisfactory portions...but don't forget good things comes with price...Get ready to pay 100+ Euro pp with very modest drink...If you order good wine you add up."
178,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food, the meats, the view, the staff - it's all super!"
179,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great restaurant, dined here when staying at the W hotel. My gf and I had a great experience at the chefs table... Made the dinner a bit more exciting rather then just another dinner with your own table. Great food would recommend to anyone."
180,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fantastic service. Great view over Dam square. I personally loved the decor and the drinks were on point. I've heard the steaks are top but will have to cone back to find out.
181,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great restaurant but you will enjoy the atmosphere more than the food. Very lifely place often with loud music. The food is good but not what you would expect for a restaurant on that level.
182,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We had the New York strips, fries and cauliflower Mac and cheese. Steak was okay, the cauliflower Mac and cheese barely had any cauliflower. Atmosphere is good and service is good as well. Overall, okay experience especially because it is an expensive restaurant."
183,Mr Porter, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This place is not a Steakhouse, is a BREADHOUSE if anything. We were a group of 12 so we got ripped off with the set menu of €75.... The meat came on plates to share, only 2 cuts and less than 250grs per person... How can they call that a …"
184,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The place looks VIP, feel VIP and the food is GOOD. Ive nothing bad to say about this restaurant. Me and 4 mates ate and drink Well for about 250 euro’s. By no means cheap, but for what you get, not expensive."
185,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice Chill Spot! Music a bit loud though. Friendly staff. When sunny bring swimsuit die cool water dip even. Relaxed atmosfeer. I do advice!!!
186,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very good food. You need to be aware that you made a reservation for a time slot. Once the time slot is finished you will have to go. That is awkward if you even didn't have dessert or coffee. Music is a bit loud for a formal conversation eith eg a customer but doable.
187,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,7 months ago,perfect food and vibes
188,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place, steaks are absolutly supreme, basically whatever you choose you will not regret. It is also a shared dining experiance. And don't get too full with the steaks, the place is actually famous for its deserts."
189,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best steakhouses in Amsterdam. Dry aged steaks. Wine list with a decent choice of good wines around €70-80
190,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful ingredients, very attentive service. Sadly the cook doesn’t live up to what one would expect-especially at this price point-
Also, the toilets are poorly maintained & dirty. This place could do better."
191,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The focaccia bread and dip is absolutely amazing!!! I would return for that alone.  Our entire meal was amazing.  Try the coconut dessert it is phenomenal!!

199,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Nice restaurant and very good food
200,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,9 months ago,The food is tasty but definitely overpriced. The service is generally good
201,Mr Porter, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Ir is a great place, I mean, the facilities and the interior design make the place quite cosy and cool. Food is pretty good and the service is.. well.. is not too bad I would say. The missing star is due to the price, I ended up paying …"

214,Mr Porter, 1 star ,2 years ago,The GM is a hot head. I personally saw him dress down someone for no reason. I have no respect for a small minded manger who gets his thrills from belittling others.
215,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food and atmosphere
216,Mr Porter, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Waited 30 minutes to get a drink. Asked the girl 2 times, they kept serving other tables that  arrived after us. Tried to make a complain with the manager who wouldn't even look at us!!! Your service sucks!"
217,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best meat place in Amsterdam as I've noticed.
The service is great, the ambience is great. Overall I've not seen anything matching this place for meat in Amsterdam."
218,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Probably the best place for steaks in Amsterdam. It's pricey and you will need a reservation but if it is good meat you are after... look no more.
219,Mr Porter, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing food, cocktails and beautiful rooftop view. The music was great too."
220,Mr Porter, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Steaks don't cost their price, too roasted outside. Like you eat a kebab. You won't even feel a good quality of meat."

229,Mr Porter, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"They have a set menu for groups, taste nice but not enough food. Aside from the food, the service is bad. From email contact, to frontdesk to the tables service. Rude and unmannerd."
230,Mr Porter, 1 star ,4 years ago,"If you want to pay too much for food that is not very interesting, than this is the place. If not, only go there for An overpriced drink and enjoy the view and than hurryup to a restaurant that serves good food for a good price!"
