110,Samba Kitchen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"For a Brazilian place, the food was too plain and dry, I was expecting more. Also, for some reason you will find  20% tip by default in the check which is questionable. Have to admit, the interiors was nice and cousy, that was the main reason we came here."

125,Samba Kitchen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A rare local Theater District/Hell’s Kitchen restaurant that is comfortable and takes reservations without charging $30+ for entrees. I’ve added Damba Kitchen to my short list of midtown restaurants that don’t suck.
