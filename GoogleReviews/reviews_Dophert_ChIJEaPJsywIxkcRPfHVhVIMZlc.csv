1,Dophert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very creative vegan menu! The presentation is nice! I would recommend the berry chocolate smoothie and the no tuna melt! The ‚Äòtuna‚Äô is so good! It does taste like tuna but you will still know it is made with chickpeas and jackfruit
2,Dophert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place was in our list to visit in Amsterdam, we trekked in the rain for a while to get to it. Had my first crossaint in years as a vegan and I wasn't disappointed. They had amazing cakes and drinks. They also had lots of vegan ‚Ä¶"
3,Dophert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I have been living near this place for almost a year now and this is the first time I decided to try it out. I wished I had gone there sooner. ‚Ä¶
4,Dophert, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing food, really tasty. Lovely atmosphere and really amazing friendly staff. I would (will) go there again and again!! Buy ALL THE CAKES!!"
5,Dophert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"As a meat eater, this is one of most satisfying vegan places in amsterdam. Mostly sandwichy options, (Tempe Vietnamese baguette, avocado Tempe club sandwich, etc) are 8-10 euros and filling."
6,Dophert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Try the Seitan Sandwich... it's DELICIOUS! And the peanut butter brownie cake is to die for. Try to order one as a birthday cake: best birthday cake ever!
7,Dophert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely staff and delicious vegan food! Best fries I've had in a long time üåü
8,Dophert, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty and creative vegan sandwiches and deserty. We loved it!
The only minus is that there are no windows in the part of the restaurant where you sit. But the food makes up for it."
9,Dophert, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a small place in the Spaarndammerbuurt. Often overlooked and off the beaten path, this area is very much a hotspot for good food today.  Dophert serves all vegan dishes, snacks and drinks. Try the ""bitterballen"" with mustard for a great afternoon snack or the vegan milkshake."
10,Dophert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely delicious!!! Had the quinoa burger and it was amazing. Also took the granola bowl and that was also great
11,Dophert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went to Dophert for a nice lunch, turns out their service exceeded my expectations! Super friendly waitress, phenomenal meal, and tranquil atmosphere. A great deal too, cant wait to come back! Happy times"
12,Dophert, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Little gem in a quiet part of Amsterdam. Specialised in vegan food. Great desserts!
13,Dophert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is lovely and with super friendly staff! The cakes and desserts are awesome. However , they used to have some really nice burgers that are not on the menu anymore. Although the food is still very good, I missed them! P.s.: wasn't really amazed by the milk shake, just a cream mix with fruit/ice."
14,Dophert, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We motivated ourselves to go to that vegan place and that was such a good surprise. Croissant are delicious and I am originally from France. Scrambled tofu are also very tasty so was the club sandwich. All of this with vegan latte and fresh ‚Ä¶
15,Dophert, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The burgers and fries were very delicious! But as we arrived, the kitchen closed for about 1,5 hours, so we had to come back later again (we've googled before). But nevertheless it is an awesome vegan restaurant."
16,Dophert, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a very cozy place to have lunch, coffee, smoothy, and a pice of cake. Everything is tasty and vegan. Time to time they change a bit their menu but you can be sure it will be something yummy. It's also possible order to take away, ‚Ä¶"
17,Dophert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Perfect place for lunch and diner. Burgers are amazing, dont forget to ask for sweet potato fries! I never eat cake but can't ever leave without a slice of their chocolate peanut butter fudge."
18,Dophert, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cosy cafe with delicious food and cake. I ordered the BLT on the advice of the waitress and it was great. It was so cosy I stayed for hours! The lemon and vanilla cheesecake was so so good. I‚Äôm thinking about going back again today! Yum :) you gotta visit
19,Dophert, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"DopHert serves all-vegan breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and drinks. We enjoyed a burger and a bagel as lunch, both with a creative take on 'substitute' meat and fish. The cakes at the counter looked amazing, but unfortunately we were already full. Will definitely come back for some sweets one day!"
20,Dophert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic service. The staff is super cool and speak fluent English. The vegan version bitterballen was super interesting and was hard to understand it's flavour. Splendidly crispy on the outside and really thick soya +possibly flour paste inside. Looking out for their signature vegan dophert burger too!
21,Dophert, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved all the dishes that I tried from the burgers to the nachos the jewel in the crown however was the bibimbap.
Being vegetarian I felt very comfortable with the cleanliness of the kitchen and the food served was animal free."
22,Dophert, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly and chilled. Not a huge menu-could do with some more snacks. Bitterballen were really tasty and the vegan cheesecake is one of the best I've tasted
