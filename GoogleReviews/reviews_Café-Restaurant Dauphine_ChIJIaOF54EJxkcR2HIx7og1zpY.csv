3,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice atmosphere. Staff needs training. Not very friendly, not very attentive. Food was okay, but not great. Big serving of Ravioli is rather small at 18€, and tasted rather bland."
4,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Two minutes walking from Amstelstation. Fresh food and warm service from their young team. Recommend: grilled beef tenderloin, oysters, and fruits de mer."
5,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely!! Great place for a single traveller from California! I had a vegetarian burger with fries and it was refreshing for it to be served with a mayonnaise aioli instead of ketchup! It was done nice and crispy and very flavorful it was …
6,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"The place and the food is ok, indeed not bad at all. The service is really really slow and they dont even look at you in order not to take your order. It took us forever to dinner and it was not even half full. A bit of a disaster organisation. I remeber i have been in the past (2 years ago) and the service was so much better."

14,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Very decent food quality but, like seems to be the latest fashion among Amsterdam restaurants, depending on your choice of menu Dauphine’s lockdown takeaway dinner may still involve some serious home preparation. That would be OK if more …"

16,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the opportunity to visit the Dauphine for a wine tasting, private event. The appetizers were so good that we decided to have an early dinner there after the tasting. We were very impressed with the menu and wine selection. The place was …"
17,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Great building/atmosphere. Staff was nice. We were very let down by the food. We waited a long time for it to arrive. The Fries were very salty, the ribeye was very dry and all of it was just very mediocre. Too expensive for what you get."
18,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I went with a large group. I had the sea bass and thought it was quite tasty.
19,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Really big space with possibility of having a large group sitting at one table with chairs (and not long benches!).

29,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice chill place. Had my first beer there after the lockdown
30,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Club Dauphine; the music was great. Despite bar seat tickets being only standing places at a bar that served as waiter's pick-up point for orders. Service also not too great, no eye contact and they let you wait forever. The live music was the only reason to stay."
31,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent place for a cappuccino. Feels a little big and hotel like for my personal taste. Very different than most small, cozy Dutch places. Coffee was good though and there is nothing wrong with it"
32,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It is a spacious restaurant with extensive choices. The food is well prepared and tasty. If you are fan of oysters and sea food, they have fresh and delicious ones as well. Stuff are very friendly. The restaurant is surrounded by a couple of companies, therefore during the week in the early evenings it is crowded with employees."
33,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Great building/atmosphere. Staff was nice. We were very let down by the food. We waited a long time for it to arrive. The Fries were very salty, the ribeye was very dry and all of it was just very mediocre. Too expensive for what you get."

35,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,These guys are so friendly- they were really helpful and we were there for a lot of drinks.  Reasonably priced.  A few of our party ate as well and all had good food.  Recommend if you find yourself in Amstel.  Very close to station and large outdoor eating area.
36,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Really big space with possibility of having a large group sitting at one table with chairs (and not long benches!). Very good service and helpful, smiling staff. But they can hardly compensate for the average quality of food. The only good marks go for the deserts, and the large wine list."

42,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice Restaurant in the centre of Amsterdam. Good food for reasonably prices. And the stuff was very welcoming and friendly.

44,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The venue is quite cool, but perhaps too big. It's noisy here. Good for business lunches/ diners. Not for fun or romantic get-togethers. Food is okay, staff formal. I don't know... There's something missing... I know what it lacks. No joy here."
45,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place. Good food. Been here a few times and have the idea that personnel could work a bit more structured (e.g. fixed tables per waiter). Maybe they have this already but feels a bit unstructured.
46,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Horrible fries - they dont make them just use basic supermarket frozen stuff. burger poor. low quality bun and hard overcooked meat.  poor serivice, like very poor. for table of 4 they serve 2 pieces of bread. nice icecream for desert but it is hardly their accomplishment as they buy them ready."
47,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 1 star ,3 years ago,We have eaten dinner here: steaks. It was very expensive and then the next morning both me and my sister had food poisoning. She was so bad she had to see a doctor as they refused to board her on a plane due to her still feeling sick. …

Situated in an old car showroom, it's high, spacey and light.
Combine with modern Italian dishes and a mostly crowded room - and you have …"
51,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 1 star ,3 years ago,We were the only table in entire restaurant. Servers and chefs made meals incorrectly and then demanded they were in the right. servers were sat in the corner in clear view of restaurant eating falafalel and other snacks very un …
52,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"It seems so normal today, to have this restaurant here. But this here was more of a no go area. The people from Dauphine were the first that had the guts to invest here in this are that is mostly defined by traffic. …"

59,Café-Restaurant Dauphine, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Paid 0.95 cents for tap water... waiter even got embarrassed and explained ""because it's filtered"", food was ok but nothing fantastic for the price. It belongs to these restaurants who try to make too much money."
