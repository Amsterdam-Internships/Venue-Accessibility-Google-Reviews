The owners, Kasper and Reuben, are very nice people, reliable   friendly.  I was in Amsterdam from Monday to Friday and I went there everyday to have my …"
1,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"IMHO, the best herring. It's super fresh and doesn't taste like herring in my homeland at all. I don't generally eat herring 'cause I feel nauseous afterwards, but, I felt absolutely perfect after the fresh herring in Amsterdam. And this place offers the freshest!"
2,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"YES, in case you're wondering: this is the stall Anthony Bourdain visited in the episode 'The Layover Amsterdam'. Specialty of the house is the baby herring (in Dutch 'Maatje') and it is served straight up with onions and pickles. If you …"
3,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best quick snack in Amsterdam! I loved the herring so much I had to come back again the next day. Fried codfish was good too.
4,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Started my Euro trip in Amsterdam and I told to try the herring. A friend told me about this spot when he came to Amsterdam. Had a few bites with the delicious pickle. It was just not my thing so could not finish it. 10/10 for the pickles, …"
5,Frens Haringhandel, 4 stars ,a year ago,"It is my first time trying herring. It is raw fragmented fish. At first glance, it is little gross but surprisingly tasty especially when eat it with fresh onion and pickle. …"
6,Frens Haringhandel, 3 stars ,5 months ago,The taste is good! But a typical tourist spot and therefore overpriced. 5€ for a rather small herring roll is stretching it… the fried fish (kibbeling) with sauce for 7€ was really good but expensive for the rather small portion size.
7,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A friend of mine suggested me to go there to try the traditional marinated haring with onions. I took the sandwich version and it was pretty good! I was afraid the fish had a strong flavour, but it was actually fresh and delicate. …"
8,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Simple joys of a simple but smashing street food cart. I wanted the try the raw herring and I went in skeptical. But, I was overjoyed. Fresh raw herring brined with pickle and onions. I was stoked."
9,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely small place to try the famed raw herring sandwich. Served with plenty of raw onion and pickles. It was absolutely delicious and deceptively rich, definitely needing the accompaniments served alongside. …"
10,Frens Haringhandel, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious! Recommend just the herring with pickles but for those less adventurous can go for the herring in bread. Loved the fried cod as well
11,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was my first time trying haring, I thought it was going to be really fishy and I might not like but I was pleasantly surprise!

15,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good to my European hubby's standard, but quite fishy to my Asian standard, pickled cucumber and onion made it taste better though. A very attractive young man who resembles Van Persie the football player serves you here."
16,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As for a stand with herring, they are good! It is clean inside, they keep the fish properly.
Herring is yummy, and they offer other kind of fish to everybody's liking, too. …"
17,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best herring roll I ate in Amsterdam. They give you a lot of pickles and the fish does not have that powerful smell. So if u wanna try herring but afraid of the smell try it here. The canal is close and there are some benches overlooking it to sut and eat.

40,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I had the kipper sandwich; so tasty -- I can still taste its smokey goodness. My travel companion agreed; we both thought it was a pity we couldn't just come here three times a day for all our meals. We had plenty of delicious food in Amsterdam,  but this was the best."
41,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Kibbling aka deep fried cod was the best fried fish I ever had. It was big, meaty, chunky, juicy, fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. The accompanying tartare sauce paired with the white fish beautifully."

48,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely a must visit location – you did not try herring from the kiosk, you've never been to Amsterdam. There are several different options – you can get plain herring or you can get it in a piece of bread (hot dog type piece of bread) …"

50,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Herring stands in Amsterdam are like pizzeria’s in New York (New Amsterdam for any of you history oficianados out there), everyone has there go to, or swears theirs is the best.

51,Frens Haringhandel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Must stop! Its slimy but satisfying. If you're visiting Amsterdam then you have to stop and get a pickled herring. 'Comes whole (in half) with salt and a pickle or in pieces with salt and a pickle. I thought it was tasty but a little slimy. …
