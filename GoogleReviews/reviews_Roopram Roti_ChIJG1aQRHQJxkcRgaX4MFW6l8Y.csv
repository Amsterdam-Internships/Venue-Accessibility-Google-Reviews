0,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Usually always a line out the door and I understand why! Very delicious offerings, and the spicy sauce that comes with it is proper spicy. I recommend to get your food to go and bring it to Oosterpark which is right next door!"
1,Roopram Roti, 1 star ,9 months ago,Today I ordered in store two kip roti and half way through my meal I found an insect on the chicken. Unfortunately despite its good reputation and the good flavor of the food...
2,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The potato and green bean roti is maybe the best thing I've eaten in my life, and I have eaten loads of things. Roopram Roti is the one place me and my s/o have to go to whenever we're in Amsterdam.
It's crazy good. Also, dirt cheap."
3,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Got the lamb roti with potato and beans, the lamb is so tender the entire thing just felt like a warm hug. The line for the place is always very long when’s it’s dinner time but definitely worth the wait! While making it they asked if I wanted it spicy, the sambal sauce they had was good, it was spicy and added a nice kick to it"
4,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,a year ago,The lamb roti was sooo delicious!! I can’t recommend it enough. There is always a line in front of this place but it moves very quickly. So glad I’ve finally tried the food here.
5,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Rotirol Adam East, for the best Roti or Rotirols.. Ya hear me??!!!. Enjoy"
6,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,4 years ago,My first time having Roti - Very good !! 13€ for 2 wraps
7,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best meal. It was amazing and good price. Wanted to go back again. Very very good.
8,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There are many fantastic Surinam restaurants in Amsterdam, and this one might just be the best!"
9,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Off the scale Roti. Chicken or Lamb special is amazing, with the potatoes, egg n fine beans.
Favourite place ever"
10,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great roti, especially the flat bread (fluffy and soft); the duck is fatty and the curry full of flavour. Huge line outside, but worth waiting."
11,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I used to work in Amsterdam for 7 very enjoyable years.
I literally became addicted to place. It’s a Formica table classic & the food is simply sublime! But beware, if you dare to dabble, the craving to go back & eat again, will become clinically irresistible. I kid you not!"
12,Roopram Roti, 2 stars ,2 years ago,food is good but the portion got little by little
13,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Best roti in Oost and possibly in all of Amsterdam. Quick line/ordering/waiting system that makes sure everyone gets served quickly. The linoleum floors, fluorescent lights, and packed in tables mean I wouldn’t take a date here (but maybe I …"
14,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place might not have a great atmosphere. But it doesn't have to, when they make such great roti. Also a big plus are the sinks near the tables, where you can wash your hands before and after you ate."
15,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Good roti, very popular place! Might have to line up to get your order."
16,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I tried the Roti lams extra, it was all delicious. The portion was big but just for 12.50. I would recommend. Now I understand why there is always a long line, but no worries, it is not a long waiting they are pretty efficient."
17,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Best roti in town. Not a place you can sit down n dine but a take away or a quick meal joint. Quite some queuing up so expect wait time. But service is very fast so in a max 10 min it’s your turn.
Lams extra beats it all"
18,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had wanted to come here a few months ago but didn't get the chance then later during a day trip we decided to go a bit out-of-the-way to give it a try for lunch and didn't regret it one bit.. The price is reasonable and the food was finger licking good. Definitely recommended. Tip: if you like your food spicy ask for some hot sauce.
19,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Best roti in town, but not a great atmosphere. Lines can be long, but worth it. Recommend for take out or quick meal, definitely not for a long sit down diner."
20,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best roti in town! Can be busy but they're really fast and it's worth it. No one should leave Amsterdam without trying roti and this would be the place to do it.
21,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Worth a detour, is how a Michelin guide may describe it. However it's more of a economical takeaway than eat-in restaurant. Your clothes may need a good wash if you spend a lot of time indoors. It's filled with spicy fumes. But I find that trouble totally worth it. Best rotis in Amsterdam, in my opinion."
22,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Simply the best Surinamese I have ever had or will ever have! Delicious - hits every spot - and filling, the lines may be a bit long but worth it."
23,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"After going to the IJ brewery to get a few great beers,  it's a perfect place to visit and eat at Roopram. Although prices have gone up in the last 15 years or so, it is still relatively cheap and the taste of roti and sweet Fernandes …"
24,Roopram Roti, 2 stars ,5 years ago,The food was fantastic but I started to feel sickly about 2 hours after eating it. This was the only thing I had eaten all evening. I threw up a few times. One second I would feel fine and the next my stomach would be in great pain and then I would throw up.
25,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best roti in the country. The line outside already starts to form before opening time. If you come to late they will be out of food. …
26,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great no frills roti, food was excellent except for the bara which was pre packaged. Very popular - expect a long line! You order and pay at the cashier then hand your receipt to the serving window when it's your turn."
27,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best, if not the best tasty roti in Amsterdam."
28,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious roti! The place is nothing fancy, but they deliver good quality. If they used non-disposable dishes it would have a perfect rating."
29,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Still the best place to buy your Roti.
Good Quality and Good Service."
30,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great blend of spices and tender lamb. The roti is really good and fresh. Best cheap take-out around.
31,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great food at affordable prices.
32,Roopram Roti, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Ordered 4 separate dishes (vegetarian ones) and I had the pleasant surprise at home to see that all were the same, but in slightly different form. Didn`t worth the 20 minutes waiting in queue."
33,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing food, very affordable and fast service.
The only downside was the use of polystyrene trays."
34,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Haven't eaten here in while, i'm sure it will taste as good as usual!"
35,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,5 years ago,5 stars for the lamb. There is no lamb which tastes the same as roopram. Hot and spicy. I come here again and again and have always ordered roti lamb.
36,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"LOVED it! Like the reviews said, its the best roti in town. Recommend chicken, potatoes and beans."
37,Roopram Roti, 1 star ,3 years ago,Every time it takes an eternity to get the food. Literally over 1 hour every time!!! This slave food aint even that special to begin with. Tipcally surinamese attitudes
38,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Wish they would stay open longer. Second time my roti craving came too late ;-) Delightful when you sneak in on time though!
39,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Without doubt the best place to get a Suriname Roti. Get there early or be prepared to wait in line! Even then it's still worth it.
40,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is nothing fancy, it's mainly for takeaway, but we had one of our best meals in Amsterdam for a very good price."
41,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Simply the best roti in Amsterdam! Sometimes a long queue but it's definitely worth waiting for!

45,Roopram Roti, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Nice Surinam food (TIP). Best roti place... Although the food became really salt the last few years. Could do with less..
46,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's been 4 years since I left Surinam, and the food is just as I remember it (I could be wrong) It's busy and you have to wait a bit, but it's worth it."
47,Roopram Roti, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"They have such delicious food, go have something to eat. You won't regret."
48,Roopram Roti, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The roti with it's different, delicious combination is authentically yummy."
