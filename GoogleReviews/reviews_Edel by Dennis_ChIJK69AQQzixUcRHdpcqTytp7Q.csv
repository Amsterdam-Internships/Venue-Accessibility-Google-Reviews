Location: (5/5) ‚Ä¶"
1,Edel by Dennis, 3 stars ,10 months ago,"The location of this is beautiful, you can have a a great time in a sunny day. The staff were polite and the service quality overall was fine. However the food seemed very overpriced with low quality, a platter of snacks for two costs 37 ‚Ä¶"
2,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had an amazing experience here. The staff was charming, the dishes were beautifully presented and absolutely delicious and the fact that there is finally a bit more fine dining in the West is HUGELY welcome. ‚Ä¶"
3,Edel by Dennis, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Positives: Great view, large terrace, servers were friendly
Negatives: Service took a very long time, I was very sick the evening/ next day after eating the chicken burger. I can't say for 100% that it was from eating ‚Ä¶"
4,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The place is under a new owner! The bartender -the one you see on the pics- was very welcoming and basically was the one who made us stay. Really nice drinks and atmosphere!
5,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Its hard to digest that the table you booked over a week ago is not available because ""someone came to see a football match, but they'll be gone after the game"". Just a complete lack of profesionalism and zero standards. Just call me ‚Ä¶"
6,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,8 months ago,I don‚Äôt even know how to start. Came here based on recommendations but it was a real disappointment. ‚Ä¶
7,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice location, nice terras next to the canal with cosy lighting outdoor in summer with a very friendly staff. The food is very nice"

9,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice experience, amazing view of the canal, good service and good vibes. Highly recommend it."
10,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Had such a great time here for Sunday Sundowners üçπüçªü•Ç the Aperol Spirtz, Dark and Stormy and Espresso Martini are all delicious! As well as the bites/snacks üòç Super friendly waitrons too! It‚Äôs along the water ü§©"
11,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Food was nice overall, especially the starters and beef main. Would not recommend the ‚Äúbloody biet‚Äù burger (very dry) or apple pie (very soggy dough). Also while service was friendly, it was also very much below standard (not explaining ‚Ä¶"
12,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We arrived by boat and the waterside terrace was full or reserved so they served us on the boat! Just had some snacks and a drink but was a lovely atmosphere, view and great sunny spot to catch the last rays of the evening. Friendly staff and a good vibe all round üòå"
13,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had an absolutely amazing time there! The place has a new owner, it is totally renovated and looks beautiful, with a new fancy-looking bar/restaurant inside and a new terrace. The staff is very friendly and really made efforts to accommodate our reservation. Thanks again for everything, we will be back! :)"
14,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Red wine was cold, so were the burgers. Insane pricing for small sized meals. Somewhat disorganized, but friendly staff."
15,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a great place for amazing food by Chef Dennis Huwa√´, in a very cool setting with art from ELLE Streetart(NYC) The concept is really cool, so go check it out and go and get a drink in the bar too."
16,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,9 months ago,I love this terrace and even if it was rainy and cold it was quite comfortable here thanks to the big umbrellas repairing us and to the outdoor heaters. The people working here were super!
17,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Overrated, we got a recommendation from a local so I guess it's popular place for tourists and locals. Drinks are at okeish price but food very expensive consider what Amsterdam has to offer even in exclusive restaurants . Location is good ‚Ä¶"
18,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Wasn't impressed by the portion size of food. I understand it's tapas style but the prices don't match the portions. The food itself was good (for what we got of it) and the staff were friendly at times but the person that served us gave us ‚Ä¶
19,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,7 months ago,Good location but very poor service. A simple chai latte came after more than an hour and it wasn't even close to a normal one.
20,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Summer days and evenings in Amsterdam are best to be spent with friends, drinking wine and boat watching.
That's what we did yesterday and also celebrated my friends birthday. ‚Ä¶"
21,Edel by Dennis, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I like the outside space, on the canal with lot of seats in the sun. The interior is pretty beautiful but a bit 'cold'. Apparently they never have a menu for a reason or another but you can always find the usuals:fries bitterballen and ‚Ä¶"
22,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,10 months ago,Food and drinks are really good!! Nice outdoor terrace for the summer. I find inside there is a bit of an ecco as the place is massive
23,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Good food, long wait and a little under staffed. The servers were  pleasant and doing their best to keep up."
24,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I like this place. Nice vibe inside, can terrace next to the water on the outside. Good is much much orientated towards vegetarian and the sharing plates idea, but the Duck breast dish was pretty good. Flavours were nice with some ‚Ä¶"
25,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Nice location on the water. I was really looking forward to having a nice dinner with friends. Called in advance to let them know there were a couple of vegans among us. Sadly that meant that we got the vegetarian option without the cheese ‚Ä¶
26,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was pretty ok, however it took them too long to bring us the dishes, around 45 minutes for each course!!
Given it is a three dishes bistro men√π it is unbelievable to be waiting for that ‚Ä¶"
27,Edel by Dennis, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Tasty food but VERY slow service. Took 1 hour to get drinks
28,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This restaurant was recommended by our hotel so we wanted to try it out. It was very full at the beginning what made us think it‚Äôs very popular and frequented. After having a seat, it took almost 30 minutes before someone was bringing us ‚Ä¶"
29,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If you want to experience bad service at cafe/restaurant of few years ago which was typical in Amsterdam, this is the place you can experience. Took more than 20 minutes to take an order, took more than 30 minutes to clean our dirty table, ‚Ä¶"
30,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Went there for Sunday brunch. Lovely views on the canal but what a disaster. We ordered for three and got a series of dishes on one platter that would basically feed one person. Vegetarian option came with anchovies on the ceasar salad and ‚Ä¶
31,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The location is nice and a cozy environment. We did the valentine's special dinner and for the price and what we ate, I will prefer to go to another restaurant. They have good vegetarian dishes but the fish was way too buttery."
32,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,One of my regular lunch places near my office. Great selection of food and okay staff. Can take a bit of time before you get your order sometimes. It's really nice when the sun is out and you can sit on their lovely terrace.
33,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The service can be very slow. But the place is beautiful with a great view. Great place for the hotter months when you can sit in the picnic tabbles next to the canal. The tap beer is ok, the prices are moderate to high. A good place for a date or a chill night out with friends."
34,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Good view.
Very very bad service."
35,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Vegetarians will love this tapas menu designed by the excellent chef Jonathan Karpathios who sure knows how to sublime vegetables. Don't miss the carpaccio of watermelon and the perfectly baked cauliflower. There's also fish and meat on the ‚Ä¶
36,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had our wedding party at Edel this Saturday and it was absolutely fantastic! They planned it out sop well ‚Äì had our own tent area outside with all the drinks in buckets! Thanks so much, we had a great time :)"
37,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Its a nice place but it‚Äôs overpriced. 8,5 euro for a small slice of bread with a tiny bit of ‚Äúold cheese‚Äù is a total rip off. The salad with goat cheese wasn‚Äôt filled or big too. Vibe wise nice, but hipster style, hipster prices."
38,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I brought my Korean born parents here, and they said the food was awesome. The waiter Mui was like one of the greatest guy I ever met in Europe. Go here. Drink, Eat, and Enjoy the view."
39,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice atmosphere to have a few drinks after work. compliments for the kitchen : the borrels are always really original and tasty and for the price you have a decent amount of food in your plate
40,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cozy atmosphere if you are looking for a drink snd some fancy bites. They arrange also tasting course menu' in their typical dutch environment. Enjoy
41,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Last Saturday (29th of June) I visited lokaal Edel. I went there with the parents of my girlfriend and I had the most amazing experience. Especially the waiter Huib, he made us feel at home and I would really recommend visiting this place! The fresh tuna salad is a real catch. Huib is the best waiter I‚Äôve had in a while!"
42,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good outdoor seating and very very good service! Attentive and friendly... Thanks!! Quickly Forgiven that a wrong drink was served cause very good service really goes a very long way!
43,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is simply the best caf√©/restaurant in Amsterdam. Whether you come in only one time for dinner or drinks (which we do regularly), or organize a big party here (which we did in January 2017), these guys are friendly, flexible, and professional and offer original and excellent food. 100% recommended!"
44,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The terrasse of this bar are awesome : huge tables perfect for groups or events, the place inside is also spacious, and still everything is always busy because it's a good spot with good food. Sometimes the wait for a drink can be long."
45,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy place with a good selection of beers right on the canals. Amazing in the summer although very busy, less cool if you have to stay inside but still nice. Friendly stuff and convenient location."
46,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Got seated for drinks at a large bench with no table, very strange and uncomfortable. Something I've never experienced, going to a bar and not even having a proper table."
47,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,7 years ago,You can sit down either for a coffee/beer or for dinner. I've visited a couple of time for a beer. The big plus in this place is a platform on the canal to enjoy a beer in a nice sunny day next to the water. Nice view and really relaxing.
48,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,a year ago,Best enjoyed around 3-6 before it gets super busy. Superb views of the canal on all sides and extra dock seating around the side. Yeah the service is slow but what‚Äôs the rush?
49,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"They have a perfect terrace (and a platform on the water) that makes it one of the best places to go on summer. The food is simple but good. The inside space is very well designed, is a very open and fresh space"
50,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,a year ago,The staff is quite welcoming and friendly. Food is served pretty fast. The view from the outside terrace is wonderful.
51,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I was bit worried about this place, before visiting b/c I read several low rating reviews. However, it turned out to be an awesome place! Very nice food which tasted super healthy, cool vibe, kind staffs.. it's a popular place, so a noise ‚Ä¶"
52,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Too many drunk hipsters, too loud and too crowded.
And in reply to the owner response: while I understand the need to respond to a bad review with a positive note and I appreciate the effort you took to respond, ‚Ä¶"
53,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Top location with lots of sun during the day if you're able to sit next to the water. Service is often good. They have some beer, but not exceptionally much"
54,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The place was really nice, specially for sunny days but service was the worst. They needed to close the kitchen because there was to many orders and when re open waited 1 hour to just receive fries and never came. Also they were too slow to bring you just 2 beers."
55,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Friendly and helpful staff and a nice selection of food and drinks. If the weather is good it is really pleasant to sit on the terrace and watch the boats passing. Highly recommend!
56,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Place seemed quite calm, yet it took over two hours to receive our food. Yes, your read that right, two hours. Food was good but there are other places nearby that will serve better food with less of a wait."
57,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I find this restaurant on the fork and i really like it. The Staff is very kind, and the food is excellent. The location is amazing, near the canl and when it's not too much windy you can take a drink on the canl."
58,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,2 years ago,Unfortunately Lokaal Edel's service was too slow. They needed more than an hour in order to serve us in a medium busy restaurant. ‚Ä¶
59,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Thank you Edel for your great food, excellent service and amazing location, for years on end the #1 caf√© in the city. Come here on a summer day and relax outside or on a winter day and huddle up inside. It's all good!!"
60,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Good, generous meals at a good price. The room inside is super cool and the staff are lovely. Go for the outdoor seating overlooking the canal, just beautiful."
61,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing setting. Cheap beer. A little bit too expensive for the food but would recommend booking a canal side area well in advance.
62,Edel by Dennis, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice, relaxing place right next to a canal for coffee, drinks, cocktails and snacks.
Have a lot of tables outside if the weather allows it.
Staff is friendly and relatively quick."
63,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A great place to eat or have a drink. It's next to the sea and has a great selection of beers. Staff is pretty slow but not that bad among other places.
64,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Beautiful spot but terrible service. We were a big group of people drinking cocktails and trying to order food but they only gave us issues. They wouldn't let us pay as we go, they would not serve at the bar if you were sitting outside but the outside waiters never came. We ended up leaving and going somewhere we could get served."
65,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was great -small portions so you have to order more dishes, but can taste a bit of everything-, but most of the staff has an attitude, they walk around like rich kids with a lame job on the side, one guy obviously felt ashamed he ‚Ä¶"
66,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice and cozy place for a drink or cocktail.The food is average-ish and the portions are quite small. The terrace/pier is outstanding.
67,Edel by Dennis, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We spend an hour waiting for 1 coffee and 1 beer. Staff was unfriendly and forgot the first order, before never bringing the second. Wasn't even busy. So we left."
68,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"l dont always share my experience unless its too good or too bad so this time lm afraid not a good one.The food came after an hour, its super overpriced and nothing special about the place...Its obvious the place is new and needs some ‚Ä¶"
69,Edel by Dennis, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Cosy, beautiful location, good service. Overall a nice place for coffee or beers especially with good weather but the food is not their strong point."
70,Edel by Dennis, 4 stars ,4 years ago,#quiquinnv Highly recommendable place with tasty dishes. Hidden in the west area of Amsterdam. Very good suggestion by @julianapahde 7.7/10 Qstars #beef #eggplant #wine #beer #colliflower #pita #salmon #sharing #nice #quiquinnvsfood ‚Ä¶
