0,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Bartender stands in front of me for more than 5 minutes. Doesn‚Äôt take my order. Someone else comes over. ‚ÄúCan I have a tequila sunrise?‚Äù They can‚Äôt make a tequila sunrise at a Mexican restaurant with a wall full of tequila. ‚Ä¶
1,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"We had an amazing time and dinner at Los Pilones.
The service was very good and the food even better. I really recommend it to people who love mexican food.
We had Tocos and they were amazing."
2,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The margarita pitchers were great, the queso chorizo dip was mouth watering, tacos were delicious and spicy. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to English speakers. This place was so great, we went back for lunch the next day!"
3,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The margaritas were really delicious. The tacos are a bit expensive but also worth it. The amount of guacamole served should be more compared to the price but the taste compansates for the amount. We will definitely come back for more. Thanks for the good service and tasty food.
4,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Quite authentic Mexican food. A bit pricey but still worth the try
5,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice Mexican restaurant. The ambiance and art work inside is Mexican inspired. ‚Ä¶
6,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The margaritas were delicious and the waitress even gave us the extra in a little pitcher. The food was on point. Loved the corn tortillas with the Tacos- tasted like legit Mexican food. The restaurant is cute on the inside and the staff is very friendly.
7,Los Pilones, 1 star ,5 months ago,"The food was good, BUT they forgot one of the order after waiting so long for the food. We also ordered for a glass of wine and we had to ask twice after long waiting for it. IT‚Äôs NOT a restaurant for small kids, they dont even have a high chair and food was overpriced."
8,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Service is excellent and food is great! Big servings so make sure you come in with really big appetites. I like how very Latin America the place looks and house water is served with no fee! Also, house water served in authentic Don Julio bottle, soooo original! Will be coming back again...."
9,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice Mexican food for decent prices. We particularly enjoyed the tuna tacos, a nice change and really well done!"
10,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is the 2nd time I dine at Los Pilones, in a different branch though; the one I have been to a couple of years back was in Jordan district and has been now closed. ‚Ä¶"
11,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Absolutely delicious food and drinks! The quesadillas were so good we ordered them twice. The spice levels were genuinely spicy and very tasty! Recommend the spicy margarita üçπ
12,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was good and the food was very nice. The food was a bit pricey (12.50 for a nacho platter).
I had the vegetarian enchiladas de mole, which I really enjoyed."
13,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A taste of Mi Casa! Curated by a Mexican chef, enjoyed by Mexicans and people from around the globe. Give the flautas a try and don't forget a dessert with authentic cajeta!!! Yum!"

15,Los Pilones, 1 star ,9 months ago,Used to be such a nice place with delicious margaritas. Some bald guy (I believe he was the owner or manager) kicked us out just because we asked for a table for 4. Being condescending about our knowledge of the covid regulations. Even the ‚Ä¶
16,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food and staff were good but over-priced when compared to other Mexican places in the area with more options.
17,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cosy and atmospheric little bar-restaurant. The tacos are pricey (around 18 euro) but very good. The staff were very friendly and the music was great.
18,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I always try to stop by for at least one meal when I'm passing through AMS. Not a lot of Mexican restaurants in AMS but this is a good one. Would recommend.
19,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Good food but the owner is mean to everyone especially the waiters
20,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,a year ago,Average Mexican restaurant. Tacos was average. Not the best but not the worst either. Drinks was priced fine too. Nice location a cool terrace for a sunny day. Friendly staff so +1 star for the friendly staff. Else wouldn‚Äôt recommend
21,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,When you have that appetite for Mexican food you can‚Äôt go wrong with Los Pilones the flavors are good and the flavors make it worth your time and palette. Cheers!
22,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably best margarita in town. Tacos are also nice. My favorite is the one with the shrimps. They say it's spicy but I find it quite mild, so that I had to add sauce. The prices are totally alright and the staff is nice and quick even when it's busy. I liked it a lot and I'll definitely come back many times."
23,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice cozy restaurant with good quality food. The main dishes are mainly soft Tacos, with the mix you choose. And of course, drinks like tequila or cocktails, and many more. To conclude enough to choose from. They serve fast, but their price is not cheap, I would say moderate on the high side."
24,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Overpriced for what it is. The food is good and it is some of the better tacos in Amsterdam but I still feel they are overpriced. It was about 19 euro for the equivalent if 4 tacos. These tacos are serve more as a fajita then a taco. We ‚Ä¶
25,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff are definitely some of the friendliest and most welcoming I've seen and the place which is small but cool has a New York vibe, especially if you sit at the bar. Unfortunately, the food is mediocre and definitely overpriced! Paid ‚Ä¶"
26,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious enchiladas, definitely worth the visit. Book in advance to make life easy. Cozy place, not too much room for coats or elbows, but the service was fast and friendly. The restaurant has music which might be loud for children or those who prefer a quiet meal, but it was great for us. Will be going back soon!"
27,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is amazing! Get some tacos, they will improve your life!"
28,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Authentic Mexican Street food, but not for an authentic price. Therefore not recommended. A tourist trap"
29,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Second time I have been here. First time was better. Arrived at 9pm for my table. Was told that it wasn't ready and it should be in 10 minutes. As the venue is not very large. I waited outside. The waitress kept saying that the party before ‚Ä¶

32,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great nachos, some of the best I've ever had great to share and great to have solo.

33,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great food. Very speedy service. Great margaritas!! And good location for the tourist crowd
34,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Too expensive and nothing special ... you can easily make the same food at home. We paid 20e for just 3 small tacos. The ingredients were quite poor. I'm only giving 2 stars because the waiter was really nice and friendly
35,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great and friendly service. The cocktails were original and the tacos pretty authentic. The only disappointing things was how tiny the guacamole portion was and the enchiladas. The cochinita pibil tacos my sister ordered were spot on, and ‚Ä¶"
36,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The atmosphere is so nice and cozy. It's not the roomiest but definitely a great place. The people also speak Spanish but English as well and I think someone also speaks Dutch. The meals are really good too and the verity of drinks is great.
37,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely great authentic mexican food, Good margaritha's and fast service. The place also has a nice vibe to it and is small and cute. Even my picky girlfriend enjoyed it. Prices are just right. Would recommend!"

39,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"Great little place, very authentic. Quite pricey but decent portions, lovely food and great service. The red wine was delicious as well."
40,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice ambience, although placed is tiny. Food was ok...too greasy. And prices are overrated. Staff was not organized, we were asked to order from 3 different people. And when we actually needed to add something to the order no one was paying attention."
41,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"As soon as we sat down at a table, we were greeted with a friendly face and a medium-sized basket of tortilla chips and some vegetable spicy sauce to be eaten with the chips, delicious. I had the enchilada de mole and the mole sauce was ‚Ä¶"

43,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Let's start with the good: Los Pilones serves some excellent tacos and amazing margaritas! I can't fault their offerings when it comes to food and drinks. ‚Ä¶
44,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,a year ago,"We went for dinner, they only had tacos, 3 for 15 euros.. finished eating and were still hungry as hell. no salsa or spicy sauces. all in all a very dissapointing meal.. for that price i expected much much more."
45,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was mediocre at best. We ordered the natural tacos with beef and chicken. Though flavorful, the meat was dry like it was prepared in a big batch in advance instead of cooked to order. This would also explain the reason the food ‚Ä¶"
46,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Food is delicious, and even though I frequently think they could be a bit bigger, I always leave the place completely full. ‚Ä¶"
47,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"For Mexican food this an excellent choice. Also they have some nice Mexican beer like the Modelo negro. This place is favorite by a lot of Mexican people.
The place is really small and cozy."
48,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Bottomless pitcher's of margaritas! Oh and the food üòã
49,Los Pilones, 1 star ,4 years ago,Booked a table for 4 at 8:45 on a Friday. Arrived at the place at 8:40 and we were told the reservation was moved to 9:00pm. We agreed to wait at the bar and ordered two margaritas - the barman poured two ‚Äúslushie‚Äù margarita from a machine ‚Ä¶
50,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Ordered taco's which were very good. Portion was just good for me. Small cozy restaurant which was completely full. Service was friendly. Only thing was they didnt ask for a refill of our drinks and if we wanted dessert. Prices are good, you even get free nacho's before main dish."
51,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great Tacos but pricing is a bit too high. But excellent and honest personal, so definitely nice ambience!"
52,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I walked in and asked for a table and was told I would be moved from a wall table as soon as one was available. Ordered food & drinks and then the food went to the wrong table, I had eaten half my plate before I realised and mentioned it. ‚Ä¶"
53,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, very friendly staff, but the portions were very, very small. ‚Ç¨18,50 per plate and we were still hungry.. It felt like a starter more than a main dish. Also the meat was not fresh."
54,Los Pilones, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Used to be great, now they took forever to even offer a drink and they were not close to full. Previous bar tender was great and charismatic, currently not friendly vibe. Shame!. Hope kerkstraat will keep the same. Red light to the owner."
55,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Los Pilones is a small restaurant where you cam get some nice Mexican food. They have a couple or decent Mexican beers and regular Dutch ones. I recommend the nachos Pilones as a starter. They're at a great location so combining it with some pubs makes for pleasant evening.
56,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious! Fantastic food, portion on the mains were a little small but appetizers were a good size. Cocktails are a great option aswell"
57,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Tacos were amazing. Highly recommend Al Pastor version.
58,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Good honest Mexican style restaurant. Not exciting or surprising, but really decent. Their beer cocktails are recommended! Nice staff too."
59,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I went here first time with my friends who told me that its impossible to get an reservation here. But luckily we managed to book one place. It doesn't seem to be very sophisticated resturant but food is amazing. I had mexican food bwfore as well but i really loved the food the quality and service here. They have options for everyone.
60,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great customer service from the minute we walked in the door, never really tried Mexican food but one of the staff members Susanna ? Was great and recommended one of the dishes which was lovely, credict to the chefs and Susanna, defiantly recommend ‚úÖ"
61,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Accurate, correct Mexican food with Mexican drinks. There are some adaptations though: it is not as hot as it should be, and you get a tiny-tiny amount of rice. ‚Ä¶"
62,Los Pilones, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Poor food, soggy. Tried to charge us for beer they didn't bring out. We were given two forks but only one knife? Table was dirty and wasn't cleaned from previous people. 42‚Ç¨ for two starters and a main. Would stay away in the future."
63,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We always come here for frozen margaritas, and sit on the window watching the world going by."
64,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Had  vegetarian enchiladas and taco. Enough choices for vegetarians. Good food although I had better mexican food elsewhere. Cocktails were interesting and great!
65,Los Pilones, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I never write reviews and especially not bad ones, but I feel this place does deserve one. Bad service, they left us with a dirty table and no cutlery. Didn't bring beer out at all yet tried to charge us for it. Food was somehow too dry and soggy at the same time, didn't taste good"
66,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So amazing place to enjoy mexican beers and snacks. Don't hesitate to add the spice sauces you can find on the tables. Unique experience.
67,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice and speedy service.
