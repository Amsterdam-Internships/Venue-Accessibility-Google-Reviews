0,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Always love a tasty falafel sandwich from Maoz. The sandwiches are maid fresh and ready to do. You can refill as much salad and sources as you like.
1,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Love Maoz as a vegan. Great that you can select your own veggies, just need to wait for your falafel and pita bread from the staff. They have amazing sauce options too!!!"
2,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Excellent felafel ..the lady who cooks though is not pleasant at all she is asking us to wear masks in a tough way when she is not wearing it and other customers sitting there are  not as well
3,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Service was not existent, staff just don't care, and the falafel was under seasoned, missing key flavours, and was sub par at best. The open salad system doesn't work either, and they failed to serve chips at the same time as the falafel in …"
4,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I could eat at Maoz all day every day! The pita breads seem to have gotten a bit smaller but with the open salad bar it just meant an extra trip to make sure I got to taste all the delicious options before finally wolfing down the falafels.
5,Maoz, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great DIY vegan sandwiches. You need to pay and wait for the staff to grill the bread for you then start stack up your own filling. The que is a bit confusing. I would recommend put up a sign where you should start building your sandwich because the sauce need to go in first for more tasty and flavorful results!
6,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This is the place where the best answer to the question of whether to go to the same food place every day during my 3 days in Amsterdam is “Yes”!  Their falafels are delicious!  There are many kinds of sauces available, there are too many …"
7,Maoz, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"This place is great for tourists who want a quick bite,  price is ok and I don't expect quality service . I  live locally and a few times this place has disappointed me.  Once they forget to put in the extra bits I paid for, which I only …"
8,Maoz, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best places in Amsterdam to have falafel. Pure vegetarian outlet with great taste, located right at the centre. At a walking distance from Amsterdam Centraal."
9,Maoz, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"AWFUL EXPERIENCE !!! DONT GO THERE
The brown skin guy was so disrespectful keep rolling his eyes on me ! Doesn’t even speak English and think he’s better than everyone. Got me wrong order and shouted at me in front of everyone !!! PUT YOUR FALAFEL DEEP INSIDE YOURSELF"
10,Maoz, 5 stars ,a year ago,"great falafel, freshly done , with extra eggplant and hummus, the sides you could choise in self service at a buffet. great concpet and delicious . a must try in amsderdam."
11,Maoz, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"I paid 5 euros for a piece of dry bread with 3 falafels in. No vegetables, hummus or sauce. The staff were rude. Should have stayed in the chip queue next door."
12,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a good place for vegan fast food. You can have unlimited salads for your falafel in 5£. They offer fries, falafel and salads. You can choose any sauce for 0.5£. The food was great and healthy. It's a must go place for vegans in Amsterdam. It's near to Amsterdam centraal metro station and normally very busy."
13,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Huge portions !! Wasnt the best Falafel I have tasted but it was comfort food for me. Love the refillable Veges and Sauces. The place to dine is a tad tight and not as clean as I expected in a European country.  A lot of locals seem to hangout here too.
14,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This is the best takeaway vegan falafel place. You can make falafel salad box, falafel pita bread which is awesome in taste. Very much recommended to try food here."
15,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"This was my favorite food shop. The option  are same as I ate in Amsterdam 6 years ago.
Nice option for vegetarian..  Right at the Center of Amsterdam."
16,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A very tasty falafel restaurant that was built in the heart of Amsterdam back in the early nineties. It's definitely a 100% vegan. No matter how pricey it might seem on the POS screen, You'd absolutely get the value & quality with every bite!"
17,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Still the best falafels anywhere
18,Maoz, 3 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Rude employee, mediocre food. At least it's vegan and prices are good."
19,Maoz, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Don't expect any good service. The employees are not looking happy but don't let that convince you to go somewhere else. Especially as a vegetarian or vegan this place is great. You just choose if you want falafel, eggplant or mushrooms as …"
20,Maoz, 2 stars ,7 months ago,I really do not recommend this place due to poor hygiene!!! Fillings are self service and I have personally seen high or stoned people spoiling the fillings with their hands or tasting and putting it back in the container. I just took just the falafels with pita bread and immediately escaped. No fillings though. Falafels were tasty.
21,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you're looking for a cheap meal, come here. My husband and I ate here frequently as it was good size meals at a great price. If you get the pita you can keep coming up to fill up on veggie toppings. There is a salad version if you're …"
22,Maoz, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"My best stoppage for vegeterian falafel,  I wish I could own one shop in India or atleast would love to see someone start it :)"
23,Maoz, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Maoz is a life saviour for vegan and vegetarian people. They have healthy and tasty food. You have the option to make your own falafal bowl by yourself.
24,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very central, pretty cheap considering it’s location. Vegan eastern Pitas falafel shoarma and other. Tasty simple fast food at a good price and location."
25,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely worth place for vegetarians. You get the unlimited fillings of varieties of Salad in a Pita Bread with delicious Falafel at a given price. The cost effective food from Maoz is a great on the go food while wandering in Amsterdam Centraal.
26,Maoz, 2 stars ,8 months ago,I've been to another Maoz location in Barcelona and this one is very disappointing in comparison. Toppings not nearly as tasty and diverse and also was a total mess. It's still an OK place for affordable veggie food but I'd go somewhere else.
27,Maoz, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Great choice of vegetarian foods. Freshly prepared by a polite, generous and friendly owner. Located in a nice busy corner of the damrak, a great place for practicing people watching while eating lunch."
28,Maoz, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice concept of falafel. Delicious. But, the waiters are unfriendly and not helpful. The location of the place is great and you have many tourists. So, it’s okay to ask about the food . But, the waiter feels uncomfortable when asked simple question. Seating are small, limited, and uncomfortable."
29,Maoz, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The food was very good. When you choose the pita you have several options of fillings and toppings to choose from and you can fill the pita yourself. The fries are also very good. It‘s a great concept!
30,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Amazing vegan food available at reasonable price that too in the heart of Amsterdam. Strongly recommended.
31,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Clean, tasty & warm inside the little sweet shop. The Falafel is very good, salads are extra fresh.
The Vegan Shawarma Mushroom is dry and old, stay away from it. Will differently come back for more Falafel!!"
32,Maoz, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"It's good everything is vegan. The price and quality don't quite match, though."
33,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very rude!!!!! We were a big family of 8 people, all ordering from this place, except the 7 year old and 15 year old kid who ate fries from next door. The Restaurant was almost empty. We sat down. Kids ate slowly, so when the staff/boss …"
34,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Best vegg meal (fallafel) in town for sure!

Hummus and eggplant is a recommendation"
35,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great for vegetarians and vegans. Cheap, quick, tasty, and they even have vegan mayonnaise."
36,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Super fresh, yummy & healthy. Very quick service. Highly recommended"
37,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very tasty falafel and always fresh. Perfect for lunch
38,Maoz, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I've had many falafel throughout my citytrips in European cities, but this was certainly one of the best if not the best I ever had."
39,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good vegan food. 5 euros. Clean and  fast.
40,Maoz, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best falafel of Amsterdam!
41,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Delicious falafel and the fries were perfectly cooked. The unlimited salad and nice range of sauces with your falafel
42,Maoz, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Are you looking for a falafel in Amsterdam? Then look no further. Best falafel I have had in years and very reasonably priced.
43,Maoz, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best falafel in town! Great fresh salad bar. Very hygienic.
44,Maoz, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great idea of filling pita yourself after geting the falafel. Frinedly and helful staff.
45,Maoz, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best in Amsterdam Central. Great option for Vegetarians. Must try Maoz falafel.
46,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Vegetarian fast food(pita-falafel) hardly gets better than this in Amsterdam
47,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food is absolutely amazing. Even when you are not vegan (like me) you will probably enjoy it just as much as a doner kebab. Portions are also very generous and you get a lot of Falafel in your pita. The only point of improvement is the …
48,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fresh food, good service, great taste."
49,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So good! Chips and garlic sauce while you sit and watch the world go by in a ""poke"" style container which we loved! Beautifully fried egg plant slices for €0.50!! The other vegetables looked so fresh and tasty! We're going back soon and we're heading straight there!!"
50,Maoz, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Good food i just dont know if he washes his hands or not cuz he touches your food and if he doesn't have clean hands is a 4 unless is 5.
51,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good for vegetarians , best Falafel"
52,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Awesome. The mushroom shawarma tastes magnificent.
53,Maoz, 1 star ,7 months ago,The sellers are neither nice nor honest.  2 falafel balls in a portion of falafel.  Bad experience!
54,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for vegan or vegetarian folks. The cherry on the cake was the ""coriander chutney"" just like the Indian and tomato chutney as well. Highly recommended. The only problem was seating area was limited. Rest worth a try."
55,Maoz, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great place to have a Vegitarian/Halal food with good quality and not heavy onnyour pockets as well
56,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Perfect for vegetarians if you want to have a falafel. Great service.
57,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"this is a great little place to stop for a cheap bite to eat in Amsterdam. Close to central station, it is the perfect location when heading into the city. The food is fresh and the kitchen is clean. If you want to eat in, you can sit at a …"
58,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It was my first authentic falafel of all the time and it definitely made me love it... All Vegan fast food joint in Amsterdam is best place for vegan or vegetarian like me.. it's all worth it.. staff were helpful and friendly.. a must have..
59,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Staff were super rude. There was no warning that the olives had stones in, and no warning that the sauce was SUPER spicy and overwhelming. All of the salad was watery and tasteless. There are so many other nice vegan places, don't waste your money here!"
60,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Visited this place maybe 10 years ago in Barcelona, was looking forward to see if it lives up to the expectations in A'dam. There are some nice sauces and toppings for falafel, but unfortunately you cannot really put that many on your …"
61,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We're in Amsterdam and i heard alot about this place from my friends and followers that it's a must visit food joint. It was really hyped to me by everyone and once i was there i know why it is so well know and recommended by so many …
62,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Its the cheapest and really nice vegeterian food you can find in Amsterdam city centre.  They let you fill ur own pita and they have amazing choices of fillings and sauces. The best part you can keep refilling if required, like I loved the …"
63,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,****Superb. If you need Halal food or you need vegetarian food its a good place very different type of serving specially salads. I visit everytime whenever visit Amsterdam even for few hours but i must visit Maoz. …
64,Maoz, 5 stars ,a year ago,This place saved my life. I was sampling the local goods elsewhere and was in desperate need of sanctuary! Couldnt have found a better spot. Amazing food and great people. Fries were average but it didnt matter. More babaganoush please!
65,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The french fries were good and freshly fried for us. The self-serve falafel counter area looked a little dirty and ingredients were slightly mixed so we didn't get any.
66,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"First falafel of my life and Maoz didn't disappoint for that.
This shop is veg only and serves fresh falafel prepared in front of us.
Weekend rush and cold day made seating arrangement little difficult.
Additional options for snacks could have resulted into 5 stars."
67,Maoz, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Good concept, the price is a bit high for falafel."
68,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and nice options for vegetarians
69,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A quick but extremely filling meal. The options of toppings are amazing and the free refills makes it all the more worth it. The selection on sauces is really good too. …
70,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Came in late at night after having a horrible experience at a nearby restaurant.  I wasn't expecting much since it is a chain and it was almost 1AM (they close at 2.)  But... I was hungry (starving actually) after travelling 5000 miles and …
71,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We totally love and loved this place, found it totally by mistake. But so glad we did!! Great food for vegetarian, vegans or even if your not and you wanna try something amazing! We went at least 3 time while we was in Amsterdam. The price for what you get, is well worth a visit"
72,Maoz, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Let's just say that if you're super hungry, you wouldn't mind the quality. The falafel is quite tasteless, the tahini sauce wasn't as thick as a tahini sauce should be. I remember they gave a small plastic plate for vegetables - no more. …"
73,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the falafel wraps. My only concern is the self serve salad bar. Great idea but I saw many people who came back to the self serve for ""seconds"", ""thirds"", etc to top up and I personally don't think that's very hygienic. The tongs …"
74,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Vegetarian only eatery in Central Amsterdam
75,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice and tasty food. The fact that you can refill your falafel toppings is absolutely great for customers 😀. With that the price is not expensive since you'll always eat what you can for less than 10€. Lack of seatings make its only a …
76,Maoz, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Super Unfriendly and unorganised, but tasty"
77,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I wouldn't go there again... there were 3 staff members and none of them had a welcoming face, i was treated like I was not wanted in the shop... no customer service at all... wanted to have the falafal wrap taken away... I asked the first …"
78,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Maybe the most tasty falafel I have ever eaten with very fresh vegetable and sauces you could choose yourself and put in your falafel. Very good vegan choise for something fast and healthy.
79,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best falafel in the Netherlands, as far as I'm concerned. It's juicy and piping hot, with soft and fluffy pita bread. You can stuff the pita with various pickles, vegetables and sauces, as much as can fit in there. Delicious."
80,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good choice if you're looking for healthy  but cheap food in Amsterdam, and if you make the meal deal you can refill your falafel with more and more ingredients so it is all the time super full and tasty. Highly recommended."
81,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fast service, tasty food, and pretty clean given how many people go through the store. …"
82,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Perfect place for a quick bite when you are in Amsterdam. The falafel wrap is the most popular snack here.You can either buy a small one or a large one which only differs in a euro or two. The large one gives you an option of refilling the …
83,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 years ago,If you are interested in eating healthy this is a nice quick solution. Great falafels and really fulfilling especially with the free salad bar. you can visit it multiple times when you are eating your bread. The stiff is also quite friendly. My only concern is the oil that they use for deep frying falafels.
84,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,I’m gonna be an a****le just like the manager. HORRIBLE SERVICE. This dude wouldn’t let me step into his store with the neighboring stores French fries because it wasn’t from his store. I spent €20 on his falafel sandwiches for lunch. My …
85,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,There is simply no better place for vegan fast food. 💯 Unlimited salad/topping bar is just amazing to get full off of veggies- small falafel wrap only £5! ✨
86,Maoz, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Delicious falafel with fresh salads and cheap! Definitely recommend 🥙
87,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place for vegetarian snacks...shoarma & falafal.. best rate & best quality. Only complain is they have to keep seating place clean as so much eating stuff is falling on ground from customer. If they will make more place for customer seating & well organise queue for ordering then it will be more fantastic for their business.
88,Maoz, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The falafel  was OK. Their selection of salad is good. Their 5 euro salad bowl is humorously tiny. The staff was not very enthusiastic and seemed to rush the customers away as soon as they paid.
89,Maoz, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Staff not all friendly. Cleanliness could definitely be better. Falafel’s are good. Ask for hummus. Filling enough. I have been back a few times.
90,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Some guests go back a refill their half consumed falafel with vegetables and the personnel does not even care. So when it is your turn to fill your falafel, be aware of that the tongs might have been pushed deep in someones saliva soaked falafel just a minute before."
91,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had an good and very large meal for a very decent price. Employees could be more nice, but I would be tired after a day full of tourists too, so it’s understandable."
92,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Freshly made falafel sandwich with lots of salad and sauce options. Good vegan food. Loved their Belgian fries too.
93,Maoz, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Food was great, healthy and excellent taste and good value. Unfortunately the service is terrible, it's the same staff that have worked their for years, yet they'll forget your order constantly and during peak hours it's just chaotic. …"
94,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,I came here for a family day on our vacation and we weren’t allowed to bring in our French fries and McDonald’s because he said they weren’t “vegan” I’m sorry but I don’t think I can force kids to eat Falafel’s if they don’t like them. We …
95,Maoz, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The workers for this restaurant are very unpolite, the most rude is the older Indian one. …"
96,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's not as cheap as advertised. Regular falafel, regular fries and water is 11.60 Euros. They charge even for ketchup. The food is tasty very filling but overpriced a lot."
97,Maoz, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Just beside Holland's number 1 fries, amazing falafels with pitta bread.."
98,Maoz, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good cheap vegetarian fast-food. Perfect for a quick-on the go meal in Amsterdam. Bring cash though, as they won't take cards from certain banks (they insisted ""European banks only"" and yet wouldn't take an Irish debit card)."
99,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Easy eat can be select which vegs do you want to put on your falafel! Always busy! If I order take a way then It bring to the riverside and eat it!
100,Maoz, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The falafel is good, but the workers r not nice. Always with poker face, u dont see from them any smile.
Bad energies …"
101,Maoz, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I was backpacking around Europe this past August 2015. I was in Amsterdam for 3 days and ate at Maoz everyday. The lady who runs the place is very friendly, easy to get along. The food is really good. I wish they had this restaurant chain in the U.S. Good Luck Auntyji and Maoz!"
102,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little vegan little place, only two specialties but you can fill the sandwich as you like! For a vegan it is a real must if you pass in these parts in a hurry and you can't miss eating! Kind and very clean!"
103,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very exceptional pricing for such an amazing Pita bread Falafel. Its kinda all you can eat place, you get pita bread filled with falafel and then you have to add all toppings by all yourself. Amazing concept and quality."
104,Maoz, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Nice place with simple cheap vegan food with Eastern accent
105,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,For vegetarian like me this is one of the best place to eat. Quality and reasonable at price. I would highly recommend if you are vegetarian and want to grab quick snack at reasonable price.
106,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very affordable and really tasty fresh food. You can refill salad as many times you want for fallafal. Super awesome vegetarian food. Highly recommended.
107,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"GREAT Falafel, quick eats falafel bar with delicious toppings and fries. Highly recommend. If only we had found this before the last day of our trip!"
108,Maoz, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"This is a fantastic falafel spot.  Good price and you get to load up on toppings.  Just a friendly suggestion, they won't give you a fork unless you have the bowl.  I asked for a fork so I would spill stuff everywhere trying to eat y wrap …"
109,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great value for money in the centre of Amsterdam. If you need a relatively cheap filling meal get yourself here. Chips are also cheaper here than most places! …
110,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,THE place to visit when in amsterdam. They've made everything vegan since the last time I went. 5.50€ gets you a pita with hummus and falafel and UNLIMITED salad toppings and dressings. AMAZING. You'll definitely get your money's worth at Maoz.
111,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place is great. All the items you can add to your falaffel are vegan and many of the sauces. If you ask they will be glad to point out which sauces are vegan and which are vegetarian.
112,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Love to eat there always 💞💞
113,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place does the best flaffel and fries. Plenty of veg to choose to go with you hummus and flaffel, quick service and entry of outdoor seating to enjoy the sun and watch the world go by with a good veggy. Lunch"
114,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I had falafel wrap here. And it's very filling with lots of fresh veggies. I loved it. And my kids loved it too.
115,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Beste value for money for a quick vegan snack on the go.
Freshly made Fries or Falafel Wraps topping it yourself with stuff from the salat bar and sauces!"
116,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,Horrible customer service. Have never been met with a smile at any of there locations here in Amsterdam. Like there falafel but after last visit when the man working there started mocking and talking loud to me about how they don’t take …
117,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,A very happy and intersting vegeterain experience ...i can tell you i didnt miss meat for a sec while having the falafel sandwich ..they have variety of salad to choose for your sandwich and are served with very delicioua fries ...i loved it and would want to try it again when i.go back .
118,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Avoid this place, unless if you are prepared and brave enough to get insulted by the rudest member of staff called ""Ahmed”, he has 0% customer service skills and no manners, perhaps he should consider staying at home learning some manners …"
119,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 months ago,unexpectedly good pitas (unexpected because of the very touristy area)
120,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is amazing, good food and service, these guys know how to run a takeaway !"
121,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Refill of Salads in your bread? Thats so generous. Very tasty falafel, fries and amazing sauces. Great price. Favourite in netherland."
122,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Pretty good wraps. It's hard to fit all the salad in though as they Are quite small so found myself going back to top up.
123,Maoz, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This food is delicious and cheap! The service is not always friendly but I don't bother as long as the food is cheap and good. The fries are delicious and you get a lot. The falafel is very tasty.
124,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Unprofessional service, small portions and dirty local. Can not recommend!"
125,Maoz, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Great small diner / takeaway for vegan food (falafel). 1 star? Because the 2 members or staff were screaming at each other the whole time arguing, it was uncomfortable and embarrassing."
126,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"They refused to serve any customers because they needed to restock the salad bar
When we asked we were told if the customers want then let them wait."
127,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Big hygiene issues, people refilling toppings on their sandwiches after eating them halfway through! Also, the same toppings buffet is exposed to people standing in queue."
128,Maoz, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Coming from NYC and having Maoz regularly , this is not even close to what Maoz stands for. I've even had Maoz in Barcelona which was truly tasty. Here in this Maoz it is privately owned and thy have made a mockery out of the falafels. No …"
129,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I really liked this place ,the falafel were fresh  and you can add the vegetables and sauces as per your taste which is very good as you can create ur own."
130,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A really nice place to have vegan food near Amsterdam Centraal. Super fresh and tasty falafels and plenty of add ons for you to choose. Highly recommended!
131,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Best and fresh falafel. They also have Aubergine(fried eggplant slices) which is good too. Very safe option for the vegetarians.
132,Maoz, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"It's OK, had better"
133,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The staff are not very friendly . But the food is great.  It's healthy and tasty.  It helps that they are open late and have quite a few branches around the city.
134,Maoz, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Delicious authentic falafel and a very friendly owner.
135,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best oriental (vegan) food we had in Amsterdam. You can create your own meal.
136,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cheap and tasty vegan gluten-free fast food. Salad box is three falafels with self service salad bar.
137,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to grab tasty and fresh falafel and frites. Wonderful and simple food, great selection of toppings and sauces all at reasonable prices. Seating is fine and service is quick and reliable."
138,Maoz, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is nice and very acceptable price (€5). However, it isnt really clean at the tables. Additionally, mostly its too busy to find a proper seat"
139,Maoz, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Yummy Vegan/Veg goldmine. Do visit if you are in Amsterdam! If not for staff’s rudeness, this would be 5 stars."
140,Maoz, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Food is affordable and big portion for the price. The falafel is nice but wow the staff is so rude.  Be prepared for being yelled at and them yelling at each other.
141,Maoz, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Average fries. Have different sauces to try but all in all not too much different then French fry with mayo based sauce. Maoz next door have better food and fries.
142,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent for quick veggie treat - not the same menu as Maoz in Miami Beach, FL - but still a great option for on-the-go food."
143,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A healthy option in amongst American Fast Food and hot dogs, Maoz offer falafel in pitta and other Middle Eastern cuisine. Was tasty AF."
144,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,The most racist place I’ve been in the Netherlands.  I was in line to order and they looked at me and deliberately asked the white couple behind me what they wanted to order.  I’ve been here a few times in the past and always received terrible service but this was the worst.
