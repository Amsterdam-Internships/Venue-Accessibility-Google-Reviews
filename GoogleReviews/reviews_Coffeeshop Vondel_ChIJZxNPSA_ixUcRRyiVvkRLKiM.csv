0,Coffeeshop Vondel, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"I definitely recommend the place
There's edibles, good weed in a ready-to-go form and the weed for DIY. The girl seller knows her staff very well and recommended us really good ones. Thanks! Very sincere, responsive and charming. The prices are really good, try it"
1,Coffeeshop Vondel, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"I loved this coffeeshop, quiet, good music, the girl who attends me is very nice, she informed me very well about my doubts, taking into account that I speak very bad English and Dutch, but thank you anyway, I recommend this coffeeshop , very good quality price."
2,Coffeeshop Vondel, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Very nice hash at really good prices (their nepal temple ball is crazy good for a 8€ hash), the staff was friendly and helpful, perfect place to get quality stuff if you don't want to spend hundreds in the fancy coffeeshops in the center.
(I didn't taste the weed though)"
3,Coffeeshop Vondel, 1 star ,a year ago,Worst coffeeshop we had experienced in Amsterdam. Service was horrible and not welcoming at all. Joint we bought was just rolled tabaco and one of my friend who is not cigarete smoker felt sick after smoking it. I do not recommend it.
4,Coffeeshop Vondel, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"We tried the brownies and they were awesome. Great taste, strong effect, and they are also vegan!"

8,Coffeeshop Vondel, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Weird... only allowed past the gate if we bought a drink and his weed. Saturday night 1 person in there, wouldn't let us in if we bought a drink but smoked our own as staying in nearby hotel. As he said 'his weed' he used his thumbs to point to himself... better to go to the real coffee houses"

10,Coffeeshop Vondel, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Always a pleasure to visit. The staff are very friendly and helpful. If your reading this recently, I highly recommend their Apple Haze. It's far superior to the competition. The smell,  the taste...  Wow. Definitely my buy of this visit."
11,Coffeeshop Vondel, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Probably the most relaxed and chill coffee shop I have been to yet. The weed is good with fair prices. The smoke lounge is real nice and they play very relaxing music. Good place to kick it for a while and smoke
12,Coffeeshop Vondel, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"So So, smoking appeared not strong enough, as my friend said. He expected much more..... I wanted to have some coffee or tea, but there wasn't,cause it was too late for these drinks. I didn't expect for this, it was strange, By the way we …"

15,Coffeeshop Vondel, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice atmosphere and staff but they have been selling a much cheaper haze that has been blatantly sprayed with a chemical flavour! Mango, cherry and banana haze. The cherry smelt like old cherry flavoured sweets that had gone bad. And the …"
