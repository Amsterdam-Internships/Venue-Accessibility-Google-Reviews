0,Indonesisch restaurant Betawi, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very Oily food and doesn’t taste good.  Too salty and oily.  Noodles taste fine but still put too much oil in it. Whole restaurant is full of kitchen smell which is oily. Strongly doubt if their kitchen has exhaust hood! My friend and I smell like oily kitchen after having dinner there!

17,Indonesisch restaurant Betawi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Beautiful stewed lamb. There was apparently a special bird that they flew in from Indonesia but didn't get to try it this time.
