0,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place for burguers and beers. Burgers are big and tasty, and the fries are excellent. The beer selection is wide, with some original non alcoholic alternatives. Also, nice terrace to eat outside when it's sunny."
1,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I enjoyed this pub. Relaxing, a little noisy , but good. Music is a little loud which makes for loud conversation. Overall fun place to be and meet some nice local Dutch people. Neighborhood is also very quiet and right next to the railkurt …"
2,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best burgers around and great selection of beers. Little noisy but nice atmosphere.
3,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very chill and cozy bar. It has a good local beer selection from tap. Hamburgers are delicious and juicy. Staff are always friendly and smiling. It can get crowded, especially in pub quiz nights (mostly on Tuesdays)."

5,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Been to pretty much all the good burger bars in the city, but this still is among the top 3 places on my list (if not #1). I recently took my colleagues there and also for them it has moved to the top of their list. Hard to beat the Frits …"
6,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly staff. Excellent selection of beer and interesting ambience.
7,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favourite bars in the area. Their burgers are nice and juicy and they got a good selection of (local) beers on tap. Love to go here for a their Verdicchio wine though. Combined with some finger food while hanging at the bar. Good vibes.
8,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Their burgers are awesome. They have a good deal on Monday for a burger + beer. Lots of choices of beer.
There is also a big terrace outside. Cozy place for a few drinks and or dinner."
9,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I was here on Friday night. It was pretty busy. You have a lot of choice for beers, so that's pretty nice. The food is very delicious aswell. The service was a bit slow, and they forgot to bring some drinks we ordered but that's probably …"
10,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place is always crowded. Massively popular among locals of West Amsterdam. That is of course for the outstanding burgers and the ridiculous selection of special beers. This is fast food on the go and not a sit in diner. Don't expect a lot of seating places. The available seats could feel somewhat uncomfortable.
11,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A fine bar, with a good selection of non-standard beers en some fine burgers. The ambiance inside the bar and on the terrace is nice and relaxed, although the crowd is quite hipster, especially for Amsterdam West. As a bonus it is very close to the monument for the beloved mayor Van der Laan."
12,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Burgers and beer - doesn’t get much simpler than that. Extensive selection of local and international craft beers on tap and by the bottle.  Worth a visit if you live in the area and are looking for something casual.
13,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great tasting burgers but heavy on digestion. Tried the vegetarian option; bad idea, it tasted like cardboard and I was sick at night. The beer selection is amazing though."

15,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Fun bar with great beer selection and very good burgers for a good price.  I came here on a Friday night and it was fun, the DJ was playing good music while I ate my burger and fries with my beer.  There's sitting inside and outside, so on a nice night you can sit on the covered patio area. The staff was courteous and helpful."
16,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Was listed as a ""Best Burgers of Holland"", and sadly it doesn't make my list. Burger came smothered in ketchup and mayo after being ordered without, and confirmed by the bartender that placed the order. Burger was rare and not cooked to …"
17,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been here twice, with my girlfriend and with a friend. The outdoor space is nice but the beers are overpriced. A small beer for 4.50 EUR? C'mon, I have seen better. The choice of beers is decent though, also on the tap. Service wise: the bartender is not particularly jovial, but ok."
18,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite local bar in town. It is located in the cool neighborhood known as ""de Baarsjes"" - West Amsterdam. They have great variety of local beers and not many tourists, which can be nice sometimes. Come here also for a great burger and super tasty ice-cream! Bar Frits - I love you!"
19,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great burger, the best in Amsterdam. With a very nice terrace and good selection of local beers, highly recommended"
20,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good place for a drink in an area where people live in Amsterdam and not so far from the centre of Amsterdam. I had a veggie burger, which was tempeh-based, which was OK. Chips and mayo were nice. Decent WiFi. Busy, but friendly, staff."
21,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff, great beer selection. Nice outdoor terrace. Not a big fan of the tempeh burger, was very wet and messy. I liked the previous veggie burger better."
22,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I come here every weekend to enjoy the good selection of beers that they have and the good music. Sitting here I have already written two novels. The staff is friendly and attentive. I recommend it to everyone.
23,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Hamburgers were not really hot when delivered, and the meat used for the smokey burger was bitter and not juicy, when I reported this they didn't offer me another one. The fries were good though. Didn't finish the burger and still had to pay.."
24,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I've been in Amsterdam nearly a week staying at the Ramada and haven't stopped by til near the end of my trip. This place is right up my street chilled bar, laid back music. Lesson learnt - always check out the local area before heading out …"
25,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place. We visited in the late evening so the kitchen was closed but we were able to order chips and they were delicious. The place has a vibe and was recommended to us as best hamburger in Amsterdam. Shame we were not able to try it.

27,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The place is nice and I always like it, but today I was with a group of

31,Caf√© Frits Mooy, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great chilled bar with an excellent selection of beer on draft and in bottles/cans. It’s far from the centre but if you stay in Amsterdam west (like we did) then go here.
