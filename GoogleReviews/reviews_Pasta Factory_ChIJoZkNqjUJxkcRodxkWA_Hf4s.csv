0,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"they welcomed us kindly and the pizza is absolutely delicious. you can see and taste that they use fresh ingredients. The prizes are quiet cheap compared to the other locations, especially regarding to the size of the meal, so i really recommend this spot!"
1,Pasta Factory, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Only giving it 3 stars because the food was good. If you don't care about the service then go there for the food, but if you want a whole lunch/dining experience expecting good service then avoid this place. Went there with friends to ‚Ä¶"

6,Pasta Factory, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Just had a meal there after a long day walking around Amsterdam. The four of us had a delightful selection of pizzas while sat in their Garden at the back. Staff and service both good. Would happily eat there again to try out other dishes from the menu.
7,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Appalling attitude from the manager/waiter. Rude, rushing every customer and being utterly disrespectful. On top of that, he got the first part of the order wrong. ‚Ä¶"

10,Pasta Factory, 1 star ,a year ago,Rude unnacomodating owner and staff. Various wrong orders. Knives and forks short and waited 15mins for another to be brought over. I'm sure this was on purpose. Owner didnt seem to want to be there or for us to be there either. Expensive for the average food we recieved.  Disappointing.
