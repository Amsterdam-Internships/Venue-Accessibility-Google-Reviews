28,Sluizer, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I have mixed feelings about this place.  The meal itself (Chef's Surprise--fish) was quite good (not the best I've had) and the service was also really good.  I can't really fault either.  The problems came at the end.  We ordered two …
29,Sluizer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice formal restaurant, limited but varied menu, wines expensive but decent. Friendly staff who told us how happy the residents of Amsterdam were just to live there (though I suspect it's the passive smoking of the wacky baccy!). Great night, the Americans there weren't too loud or crass."

31,Sluizer, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food and very friendly staff. Do try their ""surprise"" menu, 3 courses 29 Euros per     person. Their ingredients are sourced locally and  the standard of the food would be hard to beat in a Michelin star restaurant."
