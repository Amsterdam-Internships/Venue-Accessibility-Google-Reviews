0,II Prinsen, 5 stars ,a month ago,"This place changed recently, it's still a typical Amsterdam café brun, but now they serve wines, natural wines. 2 sparkling, 3 whites, 3 reds and one orange
Some good wine makers are here, I had a nice Trousseau du Jura …"
1,II Prinsen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Got two beers here during a beautiful day in Amsterdam. They gave us snacks along with our beers, some nuts and pretzels. I think they were free, but they didn’t show what we paid for on the receipt. The beers were very good but slightly pricey. Very good location on the canal to people watch"
2,II Prinsen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place slightly away from the bustle of the tourist center of Amsterdam that lets you semi-pretentiously enjoy beers served in dainty goblets right next to one of the many canals. For a velvety and flavorful ale that makes you beg for more, try the Gouveneur Dubbel."

7,II Prinsen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really cozy bar with friendly service and free wifi. The wood paneled interior is truly beautiful and very inviting. Expect more Dutch people and less rowdy tourists than other bars in the area. It's a wonderful spot to sit outside along the canal.
8,II Prinsen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The coziest of places for your delicious Dutch apple pie & coffee break! A small corner café along one of the canals, we were served be the friendliest guy ever! The place is cozy and clean, with a view! The delicious pie menu includes a coffee and homemade whipped cream...worth a stop!"
9,II Prinsen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My favourite Brown Cafe in Amsterdam. Warm wood paneling, candles on the tables and a good selection of drinks. Very cozy for drinks with a friend, or just on your own. Locals are mostly here too, so it's a nice escape from the tourists everywhere."
