0,Holy Ravioli, 1 star ,5 months ago,"I ordered a ravioli pasta extra large portion for €16,-, the quantity is really low and 80% of portion is rucola. I cannot imagine what a normal portion would look like? Will not order here again."
1,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Walked 3 kilometers to get here and it was 100% worth it. The salad alone was fantastic, and I will be dreaming of the ravioli for years to come. Priced lower than most dinner places."
2,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"I cant comment on the delivery as I buy directly from their freezer, I like to make sure I've always got some ravioli and melanzane of holy ravioli in my freezer. Also really enjoy the pecan pie."
3,Holy Ravioli, 1 star ,8 months ago,"If I could give 0 stars I would.

Their ravioli is so fresh and yumm.. and the staff is so friendly and kind and …"
7,Holy Ravioli, 4 stars ,3 months ago,I had to go to the restaurant to buy them since I had problems in Uber Eats. They do not accept VISA which is simply not acceptable for a restaurant in the center of Amsterdam. The food was fine
8,Holy Ravioli, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious ravioli place mostly focused on take out with two tiny tables. Delightful eat in  experience and tasty food.
9,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small, cozy pasta place for a quick lunch or take away. Nice staff, good espresso and dessert."
10,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The raviolis were delicious and there is a lot of choices. You can also choose to get the ravioli and the sauce and cook it at home but if you buy it prepared it comes with extra vegetables. Very nice service as well, I’m definitely coming again !"
11,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best pasta we’ve ever had! It was just amazing and more than enough!
12,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely delicious, fresh pasta with the option to buy the ingredients and take it home to eat. Staff were very helpful and friendly. We had the spinach and ricotta ravioli, as well as the lemon ricotta ravioli. Good portions, decent price, and lovely setting."
13,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice recipes with good quality of products. Their desserts are also delicious. The selection of the products they sell in the shop is attractive. Last but not least, the service is really good. For sure I will visit this place again"
14,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Incredible pasta. Very very good! Portions are not to big, but filling and satisfying. Big eaters might need more than a pasta. Small store and not much seating, but you can get takeaway and sit by the water nearby. I have never had such good fresh pasta outside of Italy!"
15,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great choice of pastas against very sharp prices. Service is great and friendly. Had the aubergine and truffle ravioli. Can recommend! Will definitely come back.
16,Holy Ravioli, 3 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered for delivery a Citroen vegetarian pasta and vegetarian lasagne after hearing a lot about this place - unfortunately both were disappointing. We explicitly asked for lot of sauce in ravioli but all we could taste was rucola. Lasagna tasted sundried tomatoes mostly. Raspberry Cheesecake though tasted good.
17,Holy Ravioli, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had a delicious ravioli meal here. I chose veal and sage and it was freshly made with good ingredients. I will be back to taste the other options. Very good. And the service was super friendly too!
