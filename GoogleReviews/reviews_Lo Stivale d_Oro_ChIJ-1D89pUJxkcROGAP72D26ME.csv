2,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 5 stars ,a month ago,I'm an Italian guy and here I feel at home . Pizza number one in the heart of Amsterdam. Amazing!!
3,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 4 stars ,10 months ago,I've had a very lovely dinner here. Amazing italian atmosphere with great service! The pasta's and pizza's are great will return when possible.
4,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Great little trattoria with a truely welcoming host from Puglia, awesome daily specials and  all-time classics on the menu, as well as some good Italian wines."
5,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was awesome! We had to wait a little longer due to shortage of kitchen staff, but it was absolutely worth it! We ordered fish and it was possibly the best swordfish with lemon sauce I have ever ate.
We will certainly go back and try their pizza!"
6,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Wonderful restaurant in  Amsterdam really a must ate there for three evenings' Run by an Italien family. Very friendly an welcoming. Enjoyed the house wine as well. A defenite must when I visit Amsterdam again.
7,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Really enjoyed our starter of mushrooms and the mixed salad was fine. The vegetarian ravioli was excellent as was the tiramisu. The only downside of the meal was the obligation to buy bottled water. Amsterdam tap water is excellent and removes the need for transporting water across the planet.
8,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Best Italian in the city! Very close quarters inside seating but this is Europe, make friends with your neighboring table mates! Gnocchi with shrimp was to die for.. come prepared to wait a bit then slowly savor their delicious selections."
9,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place to eat affordable Italian food made by an italian family. Only downside is that you can only pay in cash. All in all, great place to go with family and friends just make sure to get in early or else you won't have any space."

14,Lo Stivale d'Oro, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Decent food. A little pricey and the staff takes a while to take your order and serve you. Definitely go for the pastas over the pizza.
