3,Casa di David, 1 star ,a month ago,"The ravioli and spaghetti was completely tasteless. We left our plate half full.
Joaqim our waiter was so rude and was unapologetic when we mentioned we didn't enjoy the food. There are much better options in the city."
4,Casa di David, 1 star ,2 years ago,Can’t believe I’m giving a 1 star review to a restaurant simply for its bad food and rude service. …

7,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cute wood filled restaurant with views of a small canal. We had a reservation and were seated right away. We were upstairs. The tables are pretty close together. But it wasn’t too loud of a place. The menus are an odd rolled up large paper. …
8,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Our fav Italian restaurant in Amsterdam. We went as a group with work colleagues. Everyone was impressed with the service. The house red wine is a must must have, and almost everything in the menu delicious. They're pretty strict abt the QR code and we appreciate that! 5 stars, as always"
9,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great good in general and the ambience is cosy and servers are very friendly.  The food quality is great, pizza, pasta or salad we ordered tasted delicious.  The place is a bit small though but very Dutch way of set up.  If u are hungry, do …"

11,Casa di David, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We were craving Italian food, so we took a risk on showing up without a reservation, and they were super kind and able to find us a table.  Shortly after we arrived it got really busy.  The service was consistent, and the food was …"

13,Casa di David, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice location and good food, a bit expensive but in line with the prices of the city. Although the service was quite bad: we waited 45 minutes just for the starters and other 30 minutes for the main course. This kind of ruined our experience here."
14,Casa di David, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Highly recommend.
The staff was very nice and friendly.
We ordered pizza salad and pasta everything was delicious"
15,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice quality food and I loved the venison in Chianti sauce with fennel puree and red apples.

18,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Italian! Very quaint and cozy. Though they can probably squeeze you in, maybe with a bit of a wait, I highly recommend that you have reservations. That staff and most of the guests were Italian. Great grappa selection too. It is our new favorite Italian in Amsterdam."
19,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was great! Service was amazing. Our server was from Tuscany and quite polite. The portion sizes were a little small for the price but not enough to really throw a fit about. Don't expect American size portions. The dessert was to die …
20,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Finally a good Italian place that makes great pasta dishes along with a good variety of meat. Try out the combined dish with the first and the second course to get a good sampling. The pizza is ok and is made in a fire oven but not the best …
21,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The staff here are brilliant. The setting is lovely as it is but they add to a great atmosphere and are entertaining. We visited as a very large group upstairs but they managed to run a good operation. The decor is lovely and authentic and …
22,Casa di David, 1 star ,3 months ago,Really rude host and horrible service! The host just gave us his back while we were asking him a question and was very racist! First rude encounter since 4 years visiting Amsterdam.. horrible place would not recommend..
23,Casa di David, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing food and service! Highly recommend you to try the truffle ravioli (and the buffalo mozzarella/burrata)!
24,Casa di David, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Atmosphere is nice, top floor is better if you get the chance to get a table up there, the food was amazing, especially the bruschettas and antipasti in general, about the pasta we had the ravioli with asparagus cream, slightly unseasoned …"

28,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has a very delicious pasta and the waiter was kind and polite. I recommend to order a table close to one of the windows on the 2nd floor, the view of the canals seems to be amazing but unfortunately when we arrived all of those tables were taken."
29,Casa di David, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Update:
Went again today (22 Sept). We were allowed to sit at the window as there were not many people present. Food service and drinks came by very fast, and servers …"

32,Casa di David, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The food is great! But the service was not good.  We felt as if we were being rushed out.
33,Casa di David, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Spinach starter was seriously understated on the menu, and possibly the best starter / dish we've had for years. Rest of the food was great too.
Lovely friendly service to top it off."
34,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very classic Italian restaurant. I really liked their Carbonara (thankfully with no cream) and they happily made it with my preference of pasta. Which is always a bonus! Very polite service too.

38,Casa di David, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of my favorite places by far. The food is exquisite, quite a big selection of various characteristic Italian dishes, fresh, beautifully served.

40,Casa di David, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Was a decent service but next time I asked to be sat next to the window for my view and I was this couldn’t sit there was no bookings so I decided that was it no tip for this service provided I am sorry do a little better next time if possible

44,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good food. Good service. Fantastic view.

51,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Don't get fooled and mistake this gem for a tourist trap. Proper and I mean PROPER Italian food for a more than fair price. The pizzas are great but I'd recommend to try the fresh pasta. As good as it gets. Italian quality, made by Italians."
52,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, great an friendly service, meat cooked exactly the way you wanted. Good wine list. Extensive menu. Don't be fooled by the dated decor, go on in and enjoy. One potential improvement might be to update the restrooms."
53,Casa di David, 1 star ,a year ago,"Horrible customer service. Wanted to treat my girlfriend to a nice birthday dinner, asked if we needed a reservation at the door and was turned away by an egotistical Italian waiter who simply turned around and walked away. …"
54,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The place was busy when we got there at a January night but we where seated in less then 5 minutes. Very noisy and you can't get privacy due to very close tables but hey! It is Italy in Amsterdam! The staff was very friendly and helpful and …
55,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Casa di David is an excellent Italian restaurant in a nice area of Amsterdam.
The restaurant itself is very nice, and I really like to see the traditional oven for pizzas. …"
56,Casa di David, 1 star ,2 years ago,The worst restaurant in our trip to Amsterdam! We visited the place because of the 4.3 stars... Unfortunately is not even close. Very disappointed... The pizza was very oily.. The salad was hot and smelled wired. As for the place... We sat …
57,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty food, authentically Italian servers, but extremely loud and busy on the weekends. If you want a quiet dinner, skip this place. If you’re ready for some Italian home cooking, humor, and atmosphere, this is your place. The pastas and pizzas are all great."
58,Casa di David, 5 stars ,4 years ago,High quality food and good / warm service
59,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We didn't make a diner reservation but still they managed to seat us. They have a wide range of house wines. And the food was good. I had a great evening.
60,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I would go here twice, three times, four times if could. I had the pleasure of eating at Casa di David during my stay in Amsterdam and absolutely loved it. The food is superb Italian cuisine with a beyond incredible selection, the staff are …"
61,Casa di David, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The ambiance was cozy, and the starters were enjoyable. However, we were disappointed by our main dishes. One of the pasta dishes was inedibly salty, the other was average and too oily, and the last was bland.

66,Casa di David, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The food was great and so was most of the service. Asked for a window table and was informed that it was a 4 seat table which we couldn't get as we were 2 eventough the place was far from full. 15 minutes later it was given to a couple that was just a little more persistent than us. No tips for U buddy! Great pasta and pizza tough!
67,Casa di David, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Terrible food and even worse service! There is only 1 waiter on a busy saturday night, who needs to be asked 3 times to provide a fork, and then becomes rude and agrressively angry when asked about items on the menu. The manager is just as …"
68,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been there twice in our 4 days in amsterdam. Its THAT good. Great authentic Italian food made by Italians. Excellent atmosphere!
Will be back for sure on our next visit to amaterdam!"
69,Casa di David, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fun Italian restaurant with friendly staff, dependable food and scrolls for menus! Great variety of wines and wonderful pasta and pizzas. Wasn't thrilled with the salmon the one time I ordered it but everything else was a hit."
70,Casa di David, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent food. Staff didn’t know one of us was Italian and said rude comments to his colleague regarding us being young and British. Service was poor compared to tables next to us who were a lot older, presumably due to the fact they assumed …"
71,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious traditional carbonara. It was quite crowded, I would recommend getting a reservation, especially on a weekend."
72,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"my favourite italian restaurant in Amsterdam. Fancy, elegant, cozy, romantic.... consider yourself lucky if you manage to have a table by the window with canal views on the second floor! The service is exquisite and the food....oh the food!!!!! very worth going!"
73,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great Italian restaurant in the center of the city. We've travelled many times to Italy, and our dinner tonight was up there with the best of our many hundreds of meals across Italy over the last 20 years. We recommend the fresh pasta."
74,Casa di David, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We had great pizzas and wine. Prices were moderate and service was ok.
75,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, it is Italian hahaha but since alot of dishes are tomato heavy and the Netherlands has a fairly poor tomato output it can be a bit underwhelming at times depending on when you go. On the other hand the dishes are well done and the menu is vast enough to make up for any poor taste."
76,Casa di David, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Wonderful italien experience.Great starters, perfect mixed grilled seafood and delicous desserts.."
77,Casa di David, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Good authentic Italian with some really nice dishes on the menu. The price is not too bad for the location but is not cheap. I had the tomata salmon pasta but could have a bit more filling. This was the same for the friend with who I was there. Else I would have given 4 stars.
78,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food. Great service. Over priced wine & water but the house white was good with fish. Toilets need a tidy up ... but overall, grab a window seat to really enjoy it."
79,Casa di David, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Staff were very pleasent and helpful. Food was delicious. Waiter made an error when ordering food and one of our parties dinner was brought out about 40 minutes before the rest. Have to say staff were very apologetic and went the extra mile ensuring our night was fantastic. Top marks for making a wrong right.
80,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good italian food but a bit pricey. The service was quite good and the pizzas and pasta's were all excellent. Classy looking place, would recommend if you have the budget."

82,Casa di David, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is definitely ok. They don't offer a huge selection but what they serve tastes good. Price: not cheap, but that is what you get in a city centre. Tables are small and they won't let you sit on bigger tables for more people than your …"
83,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food? Amazing! The wine? Beautiful. The service? Outstanding :) Marco made a visit to this restaurant very special. Definitely worth dining here. Thank you for a wonderful evening! X
84,Casa di David, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Went on a Sunday and loved it. Great food and lucked out with a beautiful window view on the second floor. Loved it so much that I returned back Monday night. Food was good but waiter this time wasn't good. He appeared inattentive and …
85,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The super yummy seafood pasta! Everything we ate here was really delicious. The restaurant was stylish, but casual enough for family with kids. The kid will enjoy watching the pizza coming up from the kitchen by the pully system to the second floor. It is very popular place, so make sure to researve your table."
86,Casa di David, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food is delicious and the views of the canal are charming.
87,Casa di David, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"While the food was okay, what upset me was a mistake on my bill. 20 euros was added on for something we didn’t order. So check your bill thoroughly because I think it was done with the expectation we wouldn’t notice. It was obvious it was …"
88,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely views from upstairs. Pasta always delicious and house made. The wine list has some great options  for you. The pizza was perfect.
89,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"From the first glimpse I thought it’s a touristic trap but it turned out to be a very proper italian restaurant. Pasta’s are killing, with burrata or shrimps def recommending, better than any other shady Italian places in the centre."
90,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super service, delicious food! I didn't want  pizza or pasta this time so tried their baked sea bass - the best I had in a long time! Highly recommended!"

93,Casa di David, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere and setting.  Food is always fantastic, and the staff will help with suggestions for food and wine.  Fancy something a bit different from the menu?  They will usually change things for you or make
You something special"
94,Casa di David, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food was mediocre, the value was poor, but above all, the service and dining experience were horrendous. …"
95,Casa di David, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice dinner, too crowded as usual but they have very good service, the food is tasty, we took pizza to share and pasta, the penne arrabiatta were excellent. The dessert was bad, the tiramisu was really poor. Small and noisy but with good Italian food"

Will definitely visit Casa did David next time in town.
Wife and I loved it."
97,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Authentic high quality good. Probably the best Italian restaurant in Amsterdam. Have been to it many times, each time was at high point of satisfaction. You definitely should give it a shot."
98,Casa di David, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Good food and wine with a nice atmosphere and service when you are with a group. Been here a couple of times with a group and would definitely recommend it. Went here alone today and was not treated well at all. waiter would quickly place …

We all had an anti pasta and a main course.
The timing and time between the dishes was very good. …"
100,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was really delicious, and don't get me started on their carbonara...
It has a very romantic settings, with a view on the canal if you're lucky enough"
101,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good Italian Restaurant. Being a South East Asian, there are a few good Italian restaurant that serves good food, but I doubt they are original. This would be my first. We had vitello tonnato which is veal with tuna sauce, and some antipasta. The food as well as service are excellent. Definitely recommending it."
102,Casa di David, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This restaurant is on the pricier side. Went with a group of colleagues. It took very long for the starters to arrive and no bread or anything else to nibble on was served in the meantine, which I found surprising for this kind of restaurant. Food is presented nicely and service is good."
103,Casa di David, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"In June this place was 50 percent locals and 50 percent tourists, so at first glance I was worried, but the veal won me over at first bite.  The surroundings are dark-but-honest.  I ate alone but took joy in watching the rope pulley …"
104,Casa di David, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Food good but waiting an hour between the starter and main course is just poor service, especially when the main courses are a pizza and a pasta dish! Americans near us were also disturbed by their waiting times. In the restaurant by 7:15, so not the busiest time. Ruined our evening."
105,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Better than average range of pastas. Had the ravioli with truffle, sage & butter - one of the best Italian meals I've ever had (and I have had many)!"
106,Casa di David, 4 stars ,11 years ago,"The food was great. Great attention to detail. the service was quite difficult - time wise - the place was packed and we had to wait to order, to get the dishes and to order some drinks later... a lot of wait. my dish was cold due to the waiting. but it was rectified immediately. I'd still recommend it though:) good food."
107,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wow for the Seafood Lasagna!  Lots of salmon and some shrimp. Lasagna bolognese was also very good. Best meal I had in Amsterdam over 3 days.
108,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food!  We ordered Zuppa de pesce, prosciutto with avocado and arugula, scallop with spinach ravioli and linguine with seafood.  Very impressed about the soup and linguine!  It's one of the best Italian we had in Amsterdam.  Ciao"
109,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The waiter Matiah is the best part of this place
The dishes are wonderful and still he is the best. Lovely, kind, funny it's like he is reading your thoughts.
A little expensive but good dishes."
110,Casa di David, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"good food - good wine selection
we also had a nice experience where the host managed to squeeze us in even-though it was fully booked on a weekend evening. Thanks for that!"
111,Casa di David, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice typical Italian restaurant. The waiters and chef are Italian and the food is really good. Not very cheap but it's Amsterdam so pretty much the same everywhere.
112,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent Restaurant in Amsterdam! Good Italian food, a little more expensive than others but for sure worth it. Great staff, great atmosphere, lovely little location for a dinner with friends or family!"
113,Casa di David, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Prices are very high for a pasta dish. I understand it's in the city center but honestly if I'm eating pasta and I pay 20 EUR it has to be great, and the one I had it was very average. Desserts, we had panna cotta with rasberry jam and a …"
114,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"the service was absolutely amazing, the food even better, they're all real Italians as well. it was the best Italian food experience I've ever had, if you don't look outside you might actually think you're in Italy."

A bit pricier than the places I go to usually but not too expensive got what you get (around 18 euros a dish)."
121,Casa di David, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent food and atmosphere coupled with an old world feel. Meals take a bit to get to your table but that is because they are prepared fresh and to your order. Would highly recommend.

Tasty and very good service"
124,Casa di David, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food was so delicious. It tasted authentic with a nice variety of options while keeping the menu small enough to focus on the quality. Service was also very good.
125,Casa di David, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice food and great settings, makes u feel like in a typical italian city, service is friendly but the guy at the entrance can be more welcoming and not shout on people, i know he is busy but can be friendly otherwise i would have rated this restaurant with a 5 star"
126,Casa di David, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Bruschetta extremely recommendable as well as the pasta
127,Casa di David, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best Italian in Amsterdam! Very good pastas. The staff is truly Italian and friendly. Take the risotto and the red house wine.

Had one of the combination dinners.  Don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu."
