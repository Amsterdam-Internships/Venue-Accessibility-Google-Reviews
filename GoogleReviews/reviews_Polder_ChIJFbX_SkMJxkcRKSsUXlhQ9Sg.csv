0,Polder, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Lots of outdoor and indoor spaces at this Science Park location. So nice to have very pleasant and  friendly staffs. Parking available at the back.
1,Polder, 2 stars ,a month ago,"This place used to have very nice food, but the quality has changed. The bread is very disappointing, industrial-like, which makes the lunch sandwiches not worth it."
2,Polder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic food. We had the lunchtime special with peanut soup. Delicious.

Went again today. Still delicious and a very good local choice if your working at Equinix."
3,Polder, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Nice out of the city place for brunch or dinner. Good quick service and nice atmosphere for a breath from Amsterdam city streets.
4,Polder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I come here often, with kids , friends or even for work with colleagues, it's fine. Staff is nice and funny. It's very homely,.including friendly dog of the house. An old characteristic farm in the middle of high tech high rises full with computer servers and brilliant students"
5,Polder, 5 stars ,a month ago,"A beautiful terrace and a good spot to be on a sunny day, Also adorable chickens around back. Nice stop while in science park"
6,Polder, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"This is a great place for locals to have a coffee, lunch or drinks. Also popular with students who meet here with their parents and teachers."
7,Polder, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Lovely place to sit outside and let the kids run free. Good, simple menu.
Do check out Anna's Tuin en Ruigte nearby, a gorgeous wild garden full of wonders"
8,Polder, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Good food, friendly staff"
9,Polder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quick bites of great quality. Menu best for corporate lunch meetings or after work dinners/drinks. However, there are animals (e.g. a chicken hen), and the menu has kid friendly options, so for a kids party it's also a good place."
10,Polder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food and helpful staff. They accommodated my allergies with a smile and it was yum!
11,Polder, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Today I had a really disappointing experience at Restaurant Polder. I've been here in the past, and have had some decent meals. Today, however, was bad. Ordered a chicken ciabatta. Could not find the chicken on the ciabatta, Just bacon …"
12,Polder, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Meeting room has only beer tables, try to sit on this for more then an hour.
Service is even for Dutch standards poor. The location and the sun makes the place but they can't be bottered to do their best. …"
13,Polder, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Cant get enough of the chicken ciabatta
14,Polder, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Based on food, Polder would easily get four to even five stars but it's the staff that I have to retract points from... …"
15,Polder, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice spacious open restaurant
Young, but very nice staff, good fair food.
Good beers, although they did not have autumn beer in October :)"
16,Polder, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food, better atmosphere.
Quite student-like, but that is expected when your restaurant is at science park. …"
17,Polder, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Was eating with my company here. Ten people approximately.
Might have been understaffed. Could be. But the service we got was horrible...and we're Dutch! So we already have low standards. …"
18,Polder, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Perfect place to have lunch :)
19,Polder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Been a thousand times, the new building is beautiful and and the coffee, beer and atmosphere are great. There are even chickens walking around, to give you a real ""farm"" vibe. The menu is great but not huge, however the quality of the products makes up for it in my mind."
20,Polder, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is meant to relax and to enjoy the food and drinks. The menu is small, and (therefore) the quality is good and the price is friendly. The service is a bit too relaxed sometimes, need to attract attention, but always very friendly and helpful. You feel treated as a guest."
21,Polder, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The entourage looks like an old plane hangar, but this cafe/restaurant in the middle of the science campus area has great quality for a decent price. Both inside and outside one can get a warm lunch or a decent meal which is quickly served by the young obers. A great place with a young feeling."
22,Polder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Had a nice simple dinner here on the sunny terrace with the family. Liked the kids meal selection and the burgers. The nachos with cheese/jalapenos were ok. Free parking which is exceptional in Amsterdam.
23,Polder, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Food is ok but nothing special . Service is below average . You might need to ask a couple of times for your long forgotten order . It happens in many restaurants in Amsterdam when the owner or manager are absent and staff rather hang out with each other than serve. The building itself is nice
24,Polder, 5 stars ,a year ago,Bitterballen and croquettes are really good here.
25,Polder, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place - enjoyed excellent toasted sandwiches, lentil salad and beer on the terrace while watching Amsterdam University students cycling towards campus. Highly recommended as a place for refuelling if you are cycling from Amsterdam to Muiderslot."
26,Polder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice spot close to science park or when you’re out riding your bike around town.
Plenty of beer, good snacks.
Staff is kind but a bit slow."
27,Polder, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the concept, and old farm (the oldest in A’Dam) transformed in a beautiful bar/brasserie/restaurant. I recommend a Pannekoek (Pancake) with whatever you wish to put on, the red Velvet, and a Latte with the milk you wish (oat milk, soy...)! I recommend brunshing there! (Vegetarian friendly!!)"
28,Polder, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is really good. Staff can be a little bit more professional. I like that there's a little bit more laid back vibe, but should not over do it, and lose quality in service by doing so."
29,Polder, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Situated on the university campus. Fppd is quite good, a variety of dishes. Friendly staff. They have some cuddly chickens on site, nice for kids."
30,Polder, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great laid back place to enjoy good weather on the large terrace. Or to rent separate room for a party. You can bring kids too, they can play on the nearby soccer field, climbing wall etc"
