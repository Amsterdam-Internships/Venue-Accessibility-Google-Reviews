6,Bella Vista, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We went to Bellavista for our 30th anniversary dinner while visiting Amsterdam.   We had a great experience.  The staff was friendly and efficient and the food and wine were excellent and affordable.  Very nice patio seating that was great for ""people watching"" and soaking in the vibe of the neighborhood.  Highly recommend it."
7,Bella Vista, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very authentic and cosy Italian, served up with authentic Italian 'hospitality'. Fantastic food, all freshly homemade and good size portions. Great location and beautiful atmosphere. Spaghetti Vongole - the best I have ever had in my life! A must go!"

9,Bella Vista, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful restaurant. I liked the bread board it was delicious. I had putanesca pasta and it was good. a lot of choice on the menu. All in all a solid place to eat on the pricier side.

12,Bella Vista, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Italian spot in the city! Don't miss it!!!You should definitely try Risotto Pescatore and their homemade Titamisu! Beautiful design and lovely staff!
13,Bella Vista, 1 star ,3 years ago,This restaurant is the worst.  The service is appalling.  The quality of the food was mediocre and did not even approach making up for the dreadful experience with the wait staff.
