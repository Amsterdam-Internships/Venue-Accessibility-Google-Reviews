3,Maria Ristorante, 4 stars ,a week ago,"Eggplant Parm entree is excellent.  Nice   sized slices.  Pasta and sauce are nicely cooked and tasty.  And I had the spaghetti and meatballs the other day, it was really good."
4,Maria Ristorante, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Go somewhere else. There are so many better options in the area! We were there for a late lunch and the place reeked of ammonia. Waitresses ignored us. The water had floaters. We eventually got silverware after we reminded the waitress …

11,Maria Ristorante, 1 star ,2 years ago,My $12 tuna Hoagie that I waited 30 minutes for was a great surprise to find nothing in the middle of it when I got home!!! What business owner would let this kind of food leave the kitchen?? What a disgrace! Thanks for reminding me why I live across the street for four years and haven't stepped foot in since 4 years ago!
12,Maria Ristorante, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Looks nice from outside flowers were nice however it's a Italian restaurant but did not have the Italian  like feel. Waitress was not to clean barly masked. You aren't able to smell any of the good food cooking in the air. The bacon …

20,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Met a friend here for lunch. I had never been to Maria's before, but it's a neighborhood gem, for sure. Eat in. Take out. Bar. A predictable pizza/Italian menu but all solidly prepared, in a warm, multi-room space. Service was friendly and excellent. I would definitely go back."
21,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was a hidden gem. Went for a work Christmas lunch.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  Great service.  My office mates and I sampled each other's food. The crab cakes were lump, very little filler with a delicious sauce. The fried …"

23,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing! Words can't describe how great this place is. We had soup, bread and a delicious entree. The portions are huge. And you have to try the desert. Make sure to save room."
24,Maria Ristorante, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Service was slow. We sat down at 6:30 and ordered. Didn't get our soup and salad until 7:30. My lasagna was over cooked. Expected much better. Restaurant wasn't that busy. Maybe 4 or 5 other tables were seated.

28,Maria Ristorante, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food is pretty good but don’t order take out unless you don’t mind waiting a couple of hours to get your food. We have ordered delivery a few times from there and it’s always taken over an hour ( we live about 2 miles away) but last night …
29,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We visited Maria's for the first time yesterday. We were there for a funeral luncheon.  We were seated promptly and offered a drink. I had the iced tea and it really was delicious.  Our wait staff Nancy and Colleen couldn't have been nicer …
30,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favorite places to get pizza in the area. Crust is delicious and always hits the spot. Their buffalo chicken and barbecue chicken pizzas are one of my all time favorites. Fries are decent as well. Good place for take out if you're in the area!
31,Maria Ristorante, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This would be a five star restaurant if  the owners would streamline the kitchen .The hostess, wait staff and food is very good. The head chef is great. Other than the time it takes to get your food from the time you place your order is way …"
32,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful food and waitstaff. They include you as part of the family. Little known secret: if you aren't 100% happy with an entire or menu item...they will make it the way you want it. For example they might have a pasta specoal with …

35,Maria Ristorante, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, great service. A real neighborhood staple."
36,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome little place to sit down and enjoy a meal. The decorations on the inside are really pretty, not what you might expect when you walk in off the streets. I also got takeout on a separate occasion- it was a bit pricey, but my calzone was amazing, practically oozing with cheese."
37,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My girlfriend and I went here for the first time cause we know someone who works there. We were so surprised at what we got. We waited awhile for the food but it was so worth it. The food was amazing for the wait. The staff is extremely friendly. I would def go there again. If you go, you will not be disappointed."
38,Maria Ristorante, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is fair.  In my opinion, lacking in basic ""Italian"" flavors; like garlic...😆.  Many of the pasta items are cream based which is not my preference.  Make sure YOU ask them to tell you about the daily specials.  The specials are …"
39,Maria Ristorante, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food here is very good if you don't mind the long wait for your food. The waitress was very nice, but it should not take over 20 minutes to receive your drink order and another 40 minutes to receive appetizers. Very slow service."

41,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Food is downright delicious. I have never had a bad meal here. Only downside is the wait staff, who are too busy playing grab @ss at times to pay close attention to their guests. Overall, the food makes up for it. Simply some of the best food in Philly... for a price that won't break your bank."
42,Maria Ristorante, 4 stars ,6 years ago,Quality Italian and American food at competitive prices. Casual dining in a relaxed atmosphere.

44,Maria Ristorante, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"I've been there three times now. Each time I have been impressed by the food but NOT by the staff. I've waited at the hostess stand, only to turn the corner and see everyone huddled in a corner paying no attention to the guests. Once we're …"
45,Maria Ristorante, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The food is quite good. Authentic Italian. I wish that it were a little more open..not as cramped. Large parties in a very small room can make the experience quite noisy.  They are overdue a menu change; it's boring for frequent diners; bracciole would be a nice addition and maybe more seafood...change it up!
46,Maria Ristorante, 4 stars ,9 months ago,We where her after a funeral so we had a limited selection. However what we had was very good. Service was great.
47,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Food was excellent as well as the service.
48,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"One of my best meals.  Great beers, I had Goose IPA.  My filet was so perfectly cooked, I've not seen steaks I've let rest for 15 minutes look and taste so good, and bleed so little.  My veggies were crisp-tender, the portion was perfect.  Patronize this restaurant!"

51,Maria Ristorante, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Horrendous and advise no one to go! While sitting in the bar, we overheard the bartender say a racial slur (n-words directed towards black people) 3 times quickly. I'm not sure whether this was in conversation or not (though loud enough to …"
52,Maria Ristorante, 1 star ,3 years ago,"A perfect example of what you get when people take no pride in their work and dont care about their jobs. Food is fine, but I cant ever get any of it! Most of the time when I order I get something that is not what I ordered, or just food …"

56,Maria Ristorante, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I ordered a deluxe italian hoagie and was disappointed to find out on all of their hoagies they charge .50 extra for lettuce and tomato, which should come standard on a hoagie. My sandwich ended up being 75% lettuce (maybe since they charge …"
57,Maria Ristorante, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is decent and you never have to wait for a table.  Downside is that the staff is mostly made up of really lazy teenagers.  Don't drink your water too fast as it might not be filled back up.  Also, don't plan on getting in and out too quickly as you'll usually have to wait a bit to get your check."
58,Maria Ristorante, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Maria’s is by far the best local spot in the Roxborough/Manayunk area. My wife and I have been going there for 10+ years now and the food is spectacular, the staff always goes above and beyond, and it’s a fun and classy atmosphere. Also, a great place to bring family and friends! Keep doing what you are doing!!"

66,Maria Ristorante, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had dinner here with friends on Saturday night. The food was tasty and fresh. We got here a little late as they close at 10pm. To be honest we all felt rushed to get out on time although the bar seemed as though it was still open.
67,Maria Ristorante, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I had really high hopes after reading the reviews, but was extremely disappointed by the food.

82,Maria Ristorante, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Be very careful ordering takeout...the delivery people don't carry change, so we paid 60 bucks for a 41 dollar meal because she didn't have ANY change.  Sure she offered to return, but yea, I'm gonna mane a delivery person return for a smaller tip???"
