0,Libertine, 4 stars ,a week ago,"The place is cozy and the personnel is really friendly. Food is good, but not something extra
ordinary. Presentation of dishes could be better. We had Rib eye which was good, but green verts were overcooked. Risotto of the week had too much onions."
1,Libertine, 1 star ,4 months ago,"The great think of this place is the location, the rest is really poor service, simple, very simple food quality... I definitely dont recommend it.
This is actually the second time I go, the first time, I left cause the staff …"

3,Libertine, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great little place.
Cozy, good simple food.
Really nice staff."
4,Libertine, 1 star ,6 months ago,This place is so badly run that the municipality closed it for a week because the owner did not care about any form of corona measures. This should be reason enough to go elsewhere...

That’s however where the fun ends. Waiter is slow, delivers us the wrong …"

7,Libertine, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Libertine Petit Cafe boasts a prime position on the Noordermarkt, perfect for sunny afternoons watching the world go by. However, the perfectly-pitched terrace is where the fun ends. Step inside on a weeknight and the restaurant is …"
8,Libertine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had a coffee and a tart and both were tasty.
9,Libertine, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not the most pleasant experience. Half of the items of the menu were not available (champagne, beers on tap, etc.). Service is horrible.
I would not come back but their french toast with berries is beyond delicious."
10,Libertine, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Nice interior but service is lousy. Waiter forgot what we ordered and after 45 minutes we still hadn’t received our breakfast orders. The waiter didn’t get back to us after we asked how much longer we had to wait so in the end we left. Too bad because the place seems nice enough.
11,Libertine, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I recently went to Libertine Petit Cafe after having not been for quite some time, and I was very happy with my experience! Great food, good vibes and music, and friendly fast service. I was also told they will be adding more cocktails and food to the menu soon. Definitely going back!"
12,Libertine, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice sunny terrace, great neighborhood, just next to the Noordenmarkt, but the service and the prices could be better. The prices are over the top. And because there are many more nice terraces in the neighborhood, next time I'll rather take my chair at other sunny terrace."
13,Libertine, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice location, and I really like the Libertine restaurant in the 9 straatjes, but the service over here at Noordermarkt really is quite poor and products a little overpriced. We went there twice now, but  both times it felt like being …"
14,Libertine, 1 star ,2 years ago,"A quiet Friday afternoon. The terrace is half full, the restaurant completely empty. Three waiters are standing behind the bar ignoring me for two minutes. Then one of them, a shorter, young man with short brown hair, looks at me. I smile …"

16,Libertine, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The menu isn't half bad, but lacks the finishing touch to justify the price. Poorest wine selection I have seen in along while. Too bad this great location has been filled with another tourist trap .."
