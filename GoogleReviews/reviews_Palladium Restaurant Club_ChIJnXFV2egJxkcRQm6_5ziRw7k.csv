0,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,a month ago,"What a lovely brasserie for a cup of coffee and other refreshments and they have an exciting food menu too. Considering that it's right in the centre of the city and in one of the most touristy areas of Amsterdam, it's not even expensive. ‚Ä¶"
1,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to stop off and feel good being waited on by great staff. It can be pricey but well worth it. Toilets are at the rear and very clean. They play great music which suits the perfect environment. I definitely advise going here.
2,Palladium Restaurant Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I don't know what is it but I found everyone in Amsterdam at least not interested with customers. Dutch clients are served first despite how long you're waiting to place order.  Quality of food and drinks very good.  Company of caf√© cat charming.
3,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely satisfied. The waiters are friendly and the food arrived quickly! Moreover the food was absolutely delicious and for the quality of the meals the prices are absolutely decent! I absolutely recommend going here! (Plus their taste in music is 11/10)
4,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I've had the most delicious sandwich in my life here. It was probably the best thing I've eaten so far. I'd definitely visit this place again if I get a chance to do so!
5,Palladium Restaurant Club, 2 stars ,9 months ago,Being there today for lunch! They waitress came to take our drink order and we asked for the lunch card. She never came back to take our food order . Eventually we were bored of waiting and left. When we went inside to pay I politely said ‚Ä¶
6,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,3 months ago,Super slow service and with no logic. A group who arrived after us was already ready and gone before we even got our lunch.
7,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, fast service, great bar and fantastic wait staffs. Music played was awesome. Great meeting place."
8,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Excellent food. Very friendly staff.
9,Palladium Restaurant Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We celebrated a birthday dinner here. However, two of my friends arrived later and were not allowed to come in. One of my friends was wearing a very reasonable outfit and the bouncer did not let him in because he wasn't dress properly and ‚Ä¶"
10,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I regret to have to say this but they discriminate at the door.

11,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent location great food my bartender worked hard to keep things moving. Suggest a reservation or just hang around and enjoy the atmosphere until your table is ready. Next time I go back to Amsterdam it is one of the first places on my list.
12,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food is not very good. Owner of the restaurant is very rude and swears at customers. Overall a bad lunch experience. Airconditioning is advertised but it is still quite hot inside. Would advise against going here, the owner almost hit us for no apparent reason except his own frustration. Just go next door."
13,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,It was my Batchelorette party and they didn't want to let me in cause I had a little veil on my head and a sash that said bride to be. They said this was against their rules. I was very disappointed. Also the lady at the door seemed very ‚Ä¶
14,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I love going to Palladium on Friday evenings for a good food & music.
The food is delicious. Sweet Potato Fries and Salmon are my favorite."
15,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Rude waitress - a young blonde. Just didn't care if we have drinks or not, walking around all the time, just passing by. The place wasn't busy at all. And then in the end they even charged us for drinks we didn't order. Didn't even say ‚Ä¶"
16,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great spot for lunch. Fast service and reasonable prices.
17,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very poor service. Owner of the restaurant is blatantly rude, swearing at customers and constantly discussing his frustrations with a friend, in the middle of his own (almost empty) restaurant. Waitresses were ashamed of their boss (poor girls), food very mediocre. Would definitely not recommend, very unpleasant experience."
18,Palladium Restaurant Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good atmosphere and food. If the bar area gets crowded and you are sat at certain tables it can feel intrusive. Service a little on the slow side but we all had a really nice evening.
19,Palladium Restaurant Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was good but nothing amazing, overpriced for what you get. Service is pretty bad we had to wait for our order more than 30 minutes (people who got there after us were getting their order first, at least 2 tables) and also a while more ‚Ä¶"
20,Palladium Restaurant Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Just waited 30 minutes for someone to serve us then we went inside and asked if they could serve us outside but they never came out so we left. I know from different times that the food is okayish. Interior is rather nice & cosy. But ‚Ä¶
21,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Went here for son's 16th,ordered sirloin steak,well done,son got cheeseburger,steak arrived undercooked and was new york strip,sent back to be replaced with another undercooked strip,and fries came after son finished burger,lovely waitresses though, who took mine off bill"
22,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"What I like about the place is its sweet & short menu with quite a variety - from a sandwich, pok√© bowl, burgers, salads to steak tartare, oysters or prawns!"
23,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very bad customer experience. Dont go here. Just dont. The boss is very rude, cusses at customers. We left without finishing our food because of the very frustrated and negative atmosphere. Food quality is poor too."
24,Palladium Restaurant Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Good Service Bad Meat. We hat the C√¥te e beauf for two. Unfortunatly the meat was to fat about 50% and its hard to beliefe that it was 850 gramms. Tasty but Quality dont met our expectations.
25,Palladium Restaurant Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food here was slapping. Fries are fresh and perfect. Get them with mayo. Americans might think that sounds weird, but it's not. It's mayonnaise, not Miracle Whip. Also the parmesan on the green beans was fire."
26,Palladium Restaurant Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good poke bowl, real sticky rice with vinegarü§ô , fresh tuna ( slightly small chunks), furikake and seaweed.
***But small size drink for the price of big"
27,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Very unfriendly service and place, asking customers every 5 minutes to keep ordering"
28,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,I was there last night with a group of 15. The waiter was so so bad. The food was fine but the waiter when questioned on where was the food I ordered was aggressive and ruined my evening there.
29,Palladium Restaurant Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I'm used to go there only during day time or dinner. Nice place and helpful staff. I like the club sandwich :)
30,Palladium Restaurant Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Like with many cafes and restaurants in the city center of Amsterdam it's too expensive in relation to the service and quality you receive. I did have good company during my last visit here
31,Palladium Restaurant Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice bar where you can have a drink and something to eah. Very friendly staff.
32,Palladium Restaurant Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A bit pricy considering the portions but the quality of the food and the service easily make up for it.
33,Palladium Restaurant Club, 1 star ,10 years ago,Aggressive security at the door during the night. Don't come here if you want to have a drink and have a great time! During daytime it's a normal bar.
