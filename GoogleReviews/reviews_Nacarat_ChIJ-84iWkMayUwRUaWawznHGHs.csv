0,Nacarat, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"My First time visiting the Terrace  this year .
It was a little bit cold out but they had the heat lamps on which was great we had a quick drink and a quick bite to eat it was really good the service was friendly I will definitely go back and recommend this to someone else that’s visiting Montreal"
1,Nacarat, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Situated right in the heart of downtown, a sure shot win for those who planned this venue for wooing it's date. My date had a negroni and couldn't resist having 2 more. The whole Ambiance looked classy. Got some garlic shrimp and striploins …"
2,Nacarat, 2 stars ,5 months ago,So yes the ambience was great!!! But the food had a piece of plastic in it.  And the waiter did not offer to bring another order so I couldn’t finish my food.   So I gave it a 2 because the service and food were not so good.
3,Nacarat, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"We were happily seated at the Nacarat Bar for late afternoon snacks. The food and ambiance were great. The view is amazing, definitely a great spot not to be missed when in downtown Montreal."
4,Nacarat, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I have been a client since the opening. John Lennon and Yoko Ono had a famous stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth, where this bar is located - so everything, unsurprisingly - service, drinks and food is nothing less than impeccable, despite the COVID situation!"
5,Nacarat, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Very chic place for cocktails. Beautiful outdoor terrace atop the Queen Elizabeth.   Staff were excellent.  Food was delicious! We ordered a board of grilled veg and some meat to share...it was amazing!  Just kind of expensive , it was $160!  Don't expect to fill up in this.  I guess you're paying for the atmosphere."
6,Nacarat, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Positive points:
-Clean and aesthetically pleasing bar
-Original, visually attractive and well organized menu …"
7,Nacarat, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Great staff, great cocktail. Lounge experience is more interesting than the terrasse."

11,Nacarat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is very cool! It’s on a rooftop terrace so you get a great view of the city. I went on a Friday night and it wasn’t too crowded, and there was a DJ there too. The meat and cheese platter is great, but a little pricey. Wait staff were nice and attentive as well."

15,Nacarat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice and cozy cocktail bar located inside the Queen Elizabeth Hotel.

17,Nacarat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nacarat is everything you ever wanted and then some. Its sophistication and sensuality is worthy of a Donald Draper hangout spot. They are not bartenders, but liquid masters at work."

25,Nacarat, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very beautiful bar with great atmosphere and very friendly and helpful staff. They know their drinks and are open to personalize your drink. A nice touch of class. Well done.
26,Nacarat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of those places that you go for the atmosphere; it has delicious food and drink but just slightly out of reach (price-wise), so not likely to frequent often. Wide range of drinks, less food options but the portions are small anyway. Music and staff were great!"

34,Nacarat, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Cocktails are amazing but it was a Friday night at last call (which is fairly early) and the waiter came around and asked if we wanted another drink but refused to let us see the menu. It seemed super rude and not very customer service …
35,Nacarat, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I went to Nacarat Bar just before the new year on a Friday night. We were a total of 6 people. The ambiance was great, and enjoyed having comfortable seats to sit in while we were there. The drinks were amazing and very creative. The music …"

37,Nacarat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The drinks were amazing.. the mixologist had such an attention to detail. We were even welcomed with a free cocktail (part of a Grand Marnier promotion I think) And finally the ambiance is just perfect.. dark and sexy. Will definitely be going again

42,Nacarat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent service. Cool atmosphere. Not busy for a Friday night. Great music. Good whisky selection. Had some weird Mexican appetizer (like a puffed pasty) that was delicious with hot sauce!
43,Nacarat, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice bar. Drinks are good. Fun fact: their curtains are actually made of heavy metal hoops. Could be considered pricey but I don't mind paying a premium if it repels certain crowds.
44,Nacarat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I went on a Thursday night around 8 pm. It was very full but not overly packed. The place has a lot of potential, the decor is gorgeous, the cocktails are delicious and the staff is attentive and welcoming. …"
45,Nacarat, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been several times and this is my overall opinion. The food menu is not good. There is no common theme to the food options (they have French dishes, Asian, Italian, Seafood etc, but do not specialize in any particular one so all are …"

47,Nacarat, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice bar, great drinks. A little on the pricy side.     My only major complaint is after observing the bartenders/barmaids, they should be careful with HYGIENE. They touch lots of stuff with their hands and then prepare drinks with the same …"

50,Nacarat, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I went for a 5 @ 7 with a friend (arrived at 5:30pm on a Thursday) and it was very busy and crowded. It was hard to maneuver towards the bar and almost impossible to get past...anyone. We felt that wherever we stood we were in the way. We …

60,Nacarat, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Who in their right mind has three drinks with near identical names on a bar menu? I ordered a negroni, got a negronin...probably one of the worst cocktails ever served. Who knows, I could have been served the negroni anejo...  Next time I will try ordering tap water, I will probably be served small plates of Spanish delicacies."
