0,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very great quesadilla ~18‚Ç¨ (3 scones, if you wanna more 1‚Ç¨for each), beef steak with baked potato. Very busy place in the evening. We was there twice (in November), always good. I recommend to visit."
1,San Tommaso, 4 stars ,3 months ago,After a good boat party during the ADE 2019 we looked for a restaurant to have a good meal. And after wandering around the city we stumbled on this place. Everything on the menu is great ! Love the meat dishes but also the grilled tuna was ‚Ä¶

5,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice rib eye steak
6,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Best pizza in town. Great service!
7,San Tommaso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"San Thomas is a better one of many Argentinean restaurants in Amsterdam. The meat is actually pretty good. The sides are pretty standard. Service quick. The interior is abundantly decorated in a slightly inconsistent style, with amazing lights on the ceiling."
8,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff are friendly, welcoming and polite and the place is well designed and spacious! The menu is extensive with lots of choice and the waiters are great in adding bits/taking away to cater for fussy eaters and children! ‚Ä¶"
9,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great Italian restaurant. The service was fast and efficient. We ordered pizza, miss salad and pesto spaghetti. Every bite was delicious and accurate. I'd given them more than 5 stars if I could. They totally deserve it."

11,San Tommaso, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Fine fresh pizza. Service quality may change - alas.
12,San Tommaso, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was very nice, perhaps not worth the money though. Unfortunately the service was extremely slow and the one waiter decided to pick his favourite tables and flirt embarrassingly with the customers whilst others waited a really long time to pay. I would not return unfortunately"
13,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Pizzas were better than those I ate in Italy. Pasta was fresh...beer was clean.....loved my experience. Do not order cola though...portion sizes small..no lemon or ice and flat! My only gripe. Would still and did go back three times in 3 days.
14,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Amazing service and high quality ingredients
15,San Tommaso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Decent food, not too wow but fair enough. Service is good. Place looks quite cool, shares kitchen with the Italian restaurant next door."

18,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was excellent.. Must try mushroom and garlic as hot starter (Item number 211).. Vegetable soup is also delicious... Second time at this lovely restaurant, last night my wife and I had shrimp pizza, mushroom and garlic and vegetable soup... Staff where very friendly and nice.. Well done.."
19,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a party of 10 and it was like 'lets check out this place'. Being veggies, we totally loved the pizza and pastas. They made me a penne arribiata with extra garlic with mushrooms and it was better then what I've had in London. Very nice staff with good service"
20,San Tommaso, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food reasonable; friendly waitress; a bit lacking in atmosphere
21,San Tommaso, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Pizza was bad, care from staff was bad, I specifically mentioned I was alergic to cherry tomatoes and they say no problem and they serve pizza with cherry tomatoes on. It is either stupidity or just try to kill someone. Don't come here and help yourself there are way better bites along the way for sure."
22,San Tommaso, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Steak was very nice rest of the meal not great. Not worth the high price.
23,San Tommaso, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waitress isn't made for the job, communication is really bad here,, 3 tables that came a 30min later than us get the food 1h before us..  The food isn't that good at all I would never come back... The only reason this place still exist is because it's in Amsterdam!!! So tourist enough to scam"

30,San Tommaso, 1 star ,3 years ago,The service was poor.  I requested my steak to be cook well done and it turned up rear. The waiter was not bothered. We had to keep repeating our request.
31,San Tommaso, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Tourist trap! Please avoid it. One of the most unpleasent places in Amsterdam. Average-low quality food, high prices and a very unfriendly and unpolite staff, particulary a girl with a very aggresive attitude. We arrived very late and the ‚Ä¶"

34,San Tommaso, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Went in after a very cold hour on the boats for a late evening meal that was warm and comforting and got exactly that - the lasagne was awesome! Staff were friendly enough and service was quick - could be because it was very quiet though!
35,San Tommaso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Came in for a late lunch. With kids. Great ambiance, a bit understaffed and the food was decent but just short of great. Not bad overall."

42,San Tommaso, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Average food, just a bit bland. Servers were kind. Shares a kitchen with the restaurant next door (where we ate, but is not on the map for review), so beware if both are busy. We waited over an hour for our entree due to this nonsensical arrangement (arrival time via Google Timeline)."
43,San Tommaso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really tender stake and nice wine. Would definitely go again.
44,San Tommaso, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It's my go-to restaurant in Amsterdam when I want a quality steak.  Try the lomo de bife.  It's excellent.

60,San Tommaso, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Amsterdam is becoming extremely expensive and this place makes no exception.  Pricy meat (nothing impressive) is no longer coming with a side plate of choice. You pay everything separately and this rises the bill. More in general in the ‚Ä¶

63,San Tommaso, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pasta was delicious, as well as the meat, and the staff was really friendly."
64,San Tommaso, 1 star ,3 years ago,A place that wants to look Argentinian but people working in there do not really have clues about Argentinian specialties. Arrogant and kind of rude behaviour from the employees. If you want to have authentic Argentinian cuisine fly to Argentina and avoid all of the crappy fake Restaurants in Amsterdam!
