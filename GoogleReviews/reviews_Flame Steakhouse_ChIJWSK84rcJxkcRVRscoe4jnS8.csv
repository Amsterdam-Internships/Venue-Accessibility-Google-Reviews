17,Flame Steakhouse, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The staff is very friendly and seated us right away.   I ordered the chicken schnitzel which was quite tasty, though it could have used more sauce and sides because it did become a little borked monotonous by the end of the meal."

21,Flame Steakhouse, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Definitely a tourist trap, only one street over from the main tourist strip - meals were astronomically overpriced but it’s to be expected with the location. 50 euros for two chicken club sandwiches and two cokes, probably one of the most expensive meals I consumed on my trip. However, the food was a decent quality and large portions."

25,Flame Steakhouse, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I’d give it 1 star, but the first meal wasn’t bad. Service was terrible. Day 2 they promised me 2 different options, and at the end wouldn’t budge. I’ll take my business elsewhere. It’s a good model on how to not treat customers. There are so many better places."
