Today I came in at around 11:45, and there was only a handful of people which ‚Ä¶"
1,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Great location in the Pijp with a menu selection that sounds good. This place gets a bunch of sun during the day so it‚Äôs nice to sit outside if that‚Äôs the case. ‚Ä¶
2,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Cool bar. The food was good, but portions are not generous for the price. I also wish the cocktail list had more to offer. Overall fun place to be."
3,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Fast and friendly service. The food was suprisingly good and fresh!
4,Het Paardje, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Food was terrible, cold and poor quality. Service is also poor.

At the end of the meal when they asked us a feedback on the lunch, I politely ‚Ä¶"
5,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Just had brunch here. They have a very limited menu (since it's not a breakfast/brunch place) but the few dishes they do offer are well made! The service was also lovely even though it wasn't very busy. Good place for a relaxed lunch.
6,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Tasty
Good ambiance
Nice for dinner and beers"
7,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,6 months ago,I had the angus beef burger with sweet potatoes fries on the side. The meat was juicy&tasty. Really friendly staff and a bottle of Verdejo white wine on ice. ‚Ä¶
8,Het Paardje, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Coffee was okay, but after we got our order the service apparently didn‚Äôt think it was necessary to continue serving us. Not asking for further drinks or food, so that we had to go inside to ask for the bill. Could have left without paying they wouldn‚Äôt even have noticed"
9,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place to sit and have a beer, however it seems you can't have fries with your beer unless you've ordered a main dish as well üëé"
10,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"In a prime location in De Pijp, Paardje is a toastie, salad and burger place with a relatively large outside space. The food is OK but not as interesting as other restaurants nearby."
11,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Brilliant service, kind and friendly bar staff, highly recommended."
12,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"We used to come here VERY often, sometimes twice weekly.
But now things have changed here.
Even when there are empty tables, not reserved, staff is reluctant to give away ‚Ä¶"
13,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Nice terrace, regular selection of drinks, slightly more pricey than average. Good system to order and pay via your phone. Some of the staff is very attentive and proactive, some others you can see it's just a side job (guy who brought the drinks didn't think about cleaning the table from previous customers ü§î)"
14,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,9 months ago,The food is fantastically delicious! Of course the Terrace is great for people watching. The staff is friendly and efficient. I should have taken photos... the food was beautifully presented.  üòç
15,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The service is fast. The location is very nice . It is one corner. I did not try the food. Only beer and tortillas chips ....  big portion.
16,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great place for an outdoor lunch in the sunshine today. Food was good and the waitresses were super lovely. One of us was in a hurry and they made sure her food was really fast. A drink for our wee dog and just lovely service.
17,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice, cozy restaurant in De Pijp. Full with young people. Easy to socialize, quick service, excellent kitchen. Friendly staff."
18,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Poor service and very average food. Not a lot  of vegetarian options
19,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Second time here. Indoors tends to smell like frying oil, and the music is loud. Waiters are friendly! The person in charge of the seating plan could do much better. Led us thinking there was a possibility of getting an outdoor seat when he ‚Ä¶"
20,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Delicious!!! Rating really to low! Everything we ordered was really good. üëç
21,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amstel on tap. Great menu, poke bowl was amazing. No problem with service at all, go inside served immediately. If it's busy then most places have longer waiting times. Be pro-active in getting served. Don't sit there and then give bad reviews."
22,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,9 months ago,Too busy and not enough care with the rain.  They should be more prepared with more spots rainproof. We're in NL after all
23,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not bad sandwiches, about 9 euros each."
24,Het Paardje, 1 star ,a year ago,"The waitress install us to the table , and then ask us to move a few minutes later , just because a Dutch Lady( regular)  can take the table and be seated With her friends , Shame on you !  The non-locals are not welcomed !"
25,Het Paardje, 1 star ,a year ago,"Now they charge 30euros per head upfront to have drinks outside.  Ridiculous!
----------------------
This is what i heard from your waiters at your bar not on website on the last Tuesday. So i'm telling the truth."
26,Het Paardje, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horrible place. We got there at 15:35. The kitchen was closed for lunch. Had to ask for our drinks 3 times. At 16.00 we asked for snacks. Not possible till 16.15. Then we asked again. Got no reply. We asked to pay twice because we were done ‚Ä¶
27,Het Paardje, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It's sad that  there are still restaurants in Amsterdam that makes you feel not welkom because you're not  dutch.
I guess, that if you are dutch, and preferably a male you  will get a good ‚Ä¶"
28,Het Paardje, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Visited this place this Saturday night with our group of 9, but the music got so loud we just had to leave. We're all used to busy and loud parties but this was bizarre. Staff were too busy to be approached. I hope they were wearing hearing protection! My ears are still ringing, hopefully the damage isn't permanent. Won't be coming back."
29,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The drinks were good, but the appetizer‚Äôs offer was a bit small. The place was beautiful and the staff very friendly!"
30,Het Paardje, 1 star ,a year ago,"This is a terrible place to go, the waiter was super rude. Not recommended at all! Despite the all bad comments about the service and staff written here, the owner still does not accept the situation and replies even rudely to your comments here. Omg!"
31,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely Place, Nice food too"
32,Het Paardje, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been there a few time and although the food is nice the service is very bad most of the time.  Once we had to wait for more than an hour and another time the server was extremely rude, commenting on how much we eat and asking us to do calculations about the bill ourselves...its a pity"
33,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and drinks!
34,Het Paardje, 2 stars ,4 years ago,One male server very good but looks like he is only serving...the lady taking orders and settling bills is very rude and needs retraining. Tons of tables and only 2 staff serving. The mint tea is very Good!!!
35,Het Paardje, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The manager Caroline is out of control. We used a door to leave the venue, she grabbed two of our group round the chest and physically dragged us out, stating that she had warned us seven times not to use the door (we had never even seen ‚Ä¶"
36,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We were there for a company lunch. There weren't any other customers in the place, which seemed rather odd.  The food was good and the service was fantastic."
37,Het Paardje, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Fair food but awful service! I guess they're still in business because of the terrace which is in full sun during lunch. Went there twice and in not very busy days I had to wait almost an hour to get a salad and the waitress wasn't paying any attention to clients. Not recommended.
38,Het Paardje, 1 star ,a year ago,"Unbelievable!!! We were rejected with 2 small kids, because we came only for drinks at 14:15 and did not want to eat!!! Applaus het Paardjeüëèüèª"
39,Het Paardje, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The service is bad and the stuff not always polite. Generally in this area there are way better options for drinks or food. Although, it's kinda ok for someone who wants to party late night."
40,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Het paardje is my favorite bar. Best bar in de pijp. Very trendy, great music, good looking people. Great service. Wonderful vibe."
41,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Sunny terrace outside. Food ok
42,Het Paardje, 1 star ,6 years ago,I haven't been in this place where they've gotten my order right and I live in de pijp. Either they forget something like fries or simply bring you the wrong thing. And worse they don't even apologise. ‚Ä¶
43,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place and both loved the lunches we got. Interesting beer and cider selection, too."
44,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place to stop for beer and a snack
45,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"One of the most popular cafe in Pijp area. In sunny days it is the best to sit outside and have some sun tan. However, service is not very good. In my opinion, staff is not very friendly."
46,Het Paardje, 1 star ,3 years ago,"This one star is only based on the horrible and slowly service, or said in another way, the service didn't exist at all. Me and my friends waited one hour and tried to get in contact with the staff. I have never experience such a rude and horrible service. Don't go there, you will waste your evening."
47,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice terrace , good vibe , always busy"
48,Het Paardje, 1 star ,2 years ago,The place was cool and staff were so friendly ..but the music was so loud i couldn't even hear myself and my throat was hurting the next day cuz of shouting and the restroom was a mess ..really if u could turn the music a bit down it would be great

50,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely fab location, in the middle of De Pijp, wine is quite good, really busy, bit in doubt of the staff."
51,Het Paardje, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great bar. Usually packed Thursday thru the weekend. Nice outside seating, with heaters and umbrellas if the weather isn't cooperating"
52,Het Paardje, 1 star ,3 years ago,They tried to make us pay for 5 beers more than we ordered and when we complained they said we couldn‚Äôt prove it and made us pay for 2 beers more than we drinker. It was really upsetting and I will never recommend this place to anyone

54,Het Paardje, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great atmosphere! Try the granola breakfast and one of the Sparkling ice teas.

59,Het Paardje, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"A good after-work bar, or a hotspot to see and be seen on a summer weekend.

60,Het Paardje, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The location and food are nice, but the service is extremely slow, bordering on rude."
