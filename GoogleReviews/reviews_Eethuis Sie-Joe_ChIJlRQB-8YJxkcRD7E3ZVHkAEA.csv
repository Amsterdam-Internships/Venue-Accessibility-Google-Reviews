9,Eethuis Sie-Joe, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I know Indonesian food, and this is not Indonesian food. The Soto Ayam was microwaved, and the Nasi Goreng is missing it's signature smell. Popular among locals, the authentic Indonesian taste has disappeared."

12,Eethuis Sie-Joe, 1 star ,5 months ago,Worst restaurant I had ever seen. No taste at all and the most surprising thing is that they had no visa payment? Are you aware that we are in 2021?

18,Eethuis Sie-Joe, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic service and I thoroughly enjoyed the Indo sambal. The food was passable and authentic. However, while good enough for a quick meal, it  wasn't so good that I could give it more than 3 stars as I wouldn't come back for it. The lamb ‚Ä¶"

25,Eethuis Sie-Joe, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy, no-frills dining. Soto Ayam a bit too salty for my liking."
26,Eethuis Sie-Joe, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good Indonesian dishes at fair prices.  If you are new to Indonesian cuisine, I recommend the bapao steamed buns or lumpia for starters, followed by nasi goreng fried noodles and satay ayam chicken skewers with a sweet and salty peanut ‚Ä¶"
27,Eethuis Sie-Joe, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"To Indonesians that longing for home cooked food, you should go to this place! Nasi goreng, lontong kuah, bakmi kuah are as good as in Indonesia. You can fulfill your sambal craving since they have our lovely Sambal Belibis right on your table!"
28,Eethuis Sie-Joe, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"It's not only about the taste of its cuisine, its also about the ambience (I'm also speaking about the language spoken). Indonesian people, diaspores, or tourists will find their second home here. For Indonesian, feels like they are going nowhere but home."
