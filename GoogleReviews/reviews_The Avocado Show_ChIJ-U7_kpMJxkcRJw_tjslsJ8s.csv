34,The Avocado Show, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was very good. However, slightly overpriced. The avocado ice cream left a lot to be desired. Avocado fries were amazing. Not pictured: nachos and hummus. We also enjoyed these dishes.  Went back twice because we loved the poke bowls."

47,The Avocado Show, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"It took our two dishes almost an hour to be served.
Both dishes (smoked salmon and fun burger) were average, not something I can recommend üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

49,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Been there for the second time. another nice visit.
they had a few little changes in the menu but that's good.
the food was very good and fresh. drinks also.
Didn't had to wait to get in even in the afternoon."
50,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,2 years ago,I ordered avocado meat burger.  The burger arrived cold and not to my liking more like a small cut of 50g (shocking taste) Avocado was not as hard to ripen as a board.  I don't really eat poison.  The beer was a comfort.  Will not go back there anymore.
51,The Avocado Show, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice atmosphere, however, longer waiting time, and the pancakes need much more maple syrup! Waiter was not so interested on my recommendation serving the pancakes with more syrup."

55,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great set up, wide range of avacado based food and drinks üòõ only downfall was that we had to pay by card but it does say on the menu. I ordered the Salamando which I thought was really tasty, filling and looked amazing."
56,The Avocado Show, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Dishes and drinks were good, a bit expensive but great quality! We came with 3 people and were seated immediately! The staff was a little bit rude but I guess it was a rush period."
57,The Avocado Show, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The concept itself is worth a visit. They use avocado creatively in a wide variety of recipes, some of them quite unexpected. ‚Ä¶"
58,The Avocado Show, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great tasting food, and really pretty presentation. We were sat more towards the back, next to the kitchen, and it did take some time before they took our order. Apart from that, good, fun experience, and will definitely be back!"

68,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"amazing food!!! so you know, the beet burger is deceivingly similar to a beef burger!! overall great experience!"
69,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,9 months ago,Rude - no menu unless you scan a code - smug. Not worth it. Even when your with a small child - who wants to see a menu. You are required to scan on your phone or else they give you no other option. So basically you pay high prices and staff to fetch your own menu. Great service!Bizarre.
70,The Avocado Show, 3 stars ,9 months ago,The food is very nice But very small portions. About the smokey salmon I got just one slice of salmon and for the price is not worth. Service was very nice and friendly.

79,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Fast and good service. Food was delicious, especially the poke bowl"
80,The Avocado Show, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Could be more avocadoy. The ‚ÄúJulio Caesar‚Äù is just a caesar salad with some avocado on it. The shakes were good though.
81,The Avocado Show, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Location and overall food were good. But don‚Äôt order the burger if you‚Äôre hungry. It‚Äôs rly small
82,The Avocado Show, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant wasn't so good. There was a small variety of dishes, and didn't have a dish we saw in their website... Not satisfying at all"
83,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We‚Äôve been to the avocado show multiple times and always enjoyed good service and great food. This last visit was absolutely unacceptable. The waiter was super unfriendly, the homemade ice tea didn‚Äôt taste like anything and we got 5 avocado ‚Ä¶"
84,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,4 months ago,We waited for 20 minutes outside in the cold rain and when the waitress finally decided to come to us after he saw us from the beginning he checked for another 5 minutes while we are out on the rain for place just to tell us No
85,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,a year ago,"This restaurant is absolutely disappointing. The burger was overpriced at 16‚Ç¨ being the size of a small biscuit. The waitress was rude and tried to force us to buy extras as well as drinks. Afterwards, she forgot the bacon for which we received no apology. If you are looking for proper food, do not come here."
86,The Avocado Show, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice experience and tasty bites, but I think the food here is too pricey."

104,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,a year ago,"This cafe is more show than substance. It‚Äôs in a fantastic location, and therefore full of tourists - which makes act as if good food or service isn‚Äôt a priority.

109,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice service and really fresh food!
110,The Avocado Show, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very underwhelming. The Instagram feed looks amazing which is why I came. But other than the neat decor and interesting menu options, the experience was meh. The staff were stressed and not particularly welcoming and food was just OK. At least the prices were decent! Glad I went but it's unlikely I'll go again."

115,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food!!! We had the best dinner :)
116,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,5 months ago,The worst customer service I ever experienced. Very rude personnel.

118,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hands down THE BEST chai tea latte I‚Äôve ever had, and I‚Äôve had a lot of chai tea lattes. Now, the food... avocado fries were delish! And the eggs Benedict were to die for. The bacon was salty and crispy, the eggs perfectly done. Highly recommend!"
119,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great experience. Prices are reasonable for an Amsterdam (and for such healthy food).
120,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food but they don‚Äôt make reservations
121,The Avocado Show, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice and original place! However the waiters are not organized. I have asked for bread 3 times and they brought it after I finished my meal... after that they also charged for the bread they I haven't even eaten...
122,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best  place in town for breakfast lunch or brunch.
Definitely must go place! All dishes not just beautiful present but also very delicious."
123,The Avocado Show, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice location and great food!
We booked online to avoid any queue but there wasn't any. I would have appreciated to be told by the staff that some products were not available anymore."

126,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Overrated, overpriced, gimmicky, and all hype. ‚Ç¨10 will get you less than half an avocado on stale toast with hummus. ‚Ç¨7.5 will get you store bought cold waffles with a just few small pieces of the green stuff on top. ‚ÄúInfluencers‚Äù seem to love the place, everything looks good on IG after all. Ok interior I guess."
127,The Avocado Show, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The food was good. But blond hair and long braids made employees feel racist.She looks like feel reluctant to serve Asian people.But the other employees were very kind and nice.

134,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It was just amazing. Friendly staff, the dishes too good and well presented. We let ourselves be seduced by the cookbook"
135,The Avocado Show, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Really? An entire avocado as the burger bun? At least put that info on the items description. I love avocados but this was a bit much. Paid much but left still hungry and unsatisfied.
136,The Avocado Show, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"very tasty food, always with avocados. long, narrow room, crowded, so perhaps some waiting, but decent service. very good for lunch"
137,The Avocado Show, 1 star ,2 years ago,Horrible experience. Food came after 1 hour and some of the items we ordered were not available which the waitress did not bother to tell us even after an hour. Furthermore when we asked for remaining items the waitress said they ran out ‚Ä¶
138,The Avocado Show, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic!
Good food, good service!"
139,The Avocado Show, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Menu is lacking more exciting options. The fried avocado chips which is the flag dish was pretty regular and not crispy as described.
