0,Zen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Such good food! The staff is very friendly, the booths are comfortable, and the ambiance is charming. It's fun to listen to the chef as he puts the sushi together. I'm a big fan of the catapillar and dragon rolls, anything with eel really. They have an arrangement of wines and both chilled premium and hot house Saki."
1,Zen, 5 stars ,a month ago,I'm glad this restaurant is in Central point. What a gem. Will be back. Food was delicious and I had the best crab jalape√±os poppers in my life.
2,Zen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I am from Houston were you have hundreds of Sushi / Sashimi restaurants to choose from for your dining needs, but I always look forward to my business trips to Medford for this place!! The large Sashimi combo is so good I fully intend to go back for dinner. No hyperbole."
3,Zen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Doesn't look like much but it has great sushi at an affordable price and really good service.
4,Zen, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Mediocre to poor.  The tempura dip tasted like vinegar. The Dragon roll was fishy, there was minimal eel on top, and the sauce was too sweet. The restaurant was completely out of low sodium soy sauce. And, there was a little gnat-like bug in my water."
5,Zen, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Good food, I had two Maguro Nigri and a spicy tuna roll.
I will definitely be back soon.
Update: went back today my new go-to place in Central Point!"
6,Zen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,LOVE their Central Point rolls! They also make fantastic teriyaki chicken.
7,Zen, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"I've enjoyed meals here in the past for sure, this time I was not happy with my sushi. My to go order contained a california roll with avocado that had browned to the point it was mushy and so was the nori. The vinigar to rice ratio was totally off because the rolls were bitter. I hope this was just a one off day."
8,Zen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Been here twice and food is yummy! Good hot tea. The sushi maker is slow but the rolls are worth the wait!
9,Zen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"My favorite sushi place around, flamming philly roll and crater comets are a must try!!!"
10,Zen, 3 stars ,a year ago,First visit. Upon entry ambiance needs updating. Sushi chef is up way above bar so don't expect usual viewing of prep. Ordered to go. Don't expect tea or beverage while reviewing menu. Menu limited. Ordered special roles which tasted almost ‚Ä¶
11,Zen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,I enjoy their food. Their teriyaki is very good. Highly recommend.
12,Zen, 1 star ,a year ago,"The food is good but the customer service is nonexistent. On one occasion, we left due to sitting at a table for 20 minutes without service, not even a menu. We decided to give them another chance several months later & same thing. We sat ‚Ä¶"
13,Zen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place was sooo tasty! Great menu. Appetizers , yummy! I had the Chicken Bento ...wow, everything was so fresh I didn't know what to eat first. My friend had 4 different kinds of sushi. I tried, for first time, a crunchy sushi!! Oh, I ‚Ä¶"
14,Zen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had the Spicy Chicken Teriyaki first and it was not disappointing. I will definitely be getting that again. We also go two sushi rolls the Central point roll and the Super dragon  also very well put together. Very pleased with the food and the service was good!
15,Zen, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Fantastic miso and the Bento Special was pretty tasty!
16,Zen, 5 stars ,a month ago,Everything was good especially that crunchy California roll
17,Zen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Enjoyed our meal. Sushi was delicious.
18,Zen, 4 stars ,a month ago,I took my Wife and Mom n Law there. I really liked this place it's nice and kozy very good staff and good food as well. Thanx you Guys and Gals. :)
19,Zen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,My wife and I were pleasantly surprised by this little hole in the wall restaurant. ‚Ä¶
20,Zen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went for our first time the other day and i cant believe we havent tried this gem before! Sushi was not overpriced, but it was amazing for the price. The egg roll and potsticker apps were amazing, a very crispy crunchy batter. We had a sushi special and it was out of this world! We will be returning customers!"
21,Zen, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not only was server rude as hell when I asked where their salmon is from, nor did she even bother to ask for me. I got a nice sharp bone in the sushi roll to stab my mouth too. Never has that happen in my life... ‚Ä¶"
22,Zen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is great for more initimate date settings. They play soft music and its properly lit. The food is great, not over priced and is served quickly. You'll definitely want a booth here though. Other wise you will be sitting center of the restaurant. If you dont mind that then you should be good."
23,Zen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful sushi, best tempura, green tea served in beautiful teapots, great service. Be sure to check the board for inventive special rolls. ‚Ä¶"
24,Zen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,This is my local sushi place and every time we've been here the sushi is outstanding. Be careful though the deep fry a few of their rolls so if you don't like that make sure you check first. You can always ask for the roll to come not deep ‚Ä¶
25,Zen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is my favorite sushi place. Blake is awesome and everyone is friendly. They keep the place clean despite the construction in front of their building.  The Las Vegas and PoPo rolls are always my go to and they always have great music playing. There is almost never a wait. Never had a bad experience. Keep up the good work!
26,Zen, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Awesome food, great atmosphere, really nice people. In my opinion, the best sushi in southern Oregon! I have had great sushi in many big cities and Zen Zen is as good or better than any I've had. I highly reccomend trying them out, you'll get hooked!"
27,Zen, 1 star ,3 years ago,I was excited to visit a new sushi joint close to home in Cental point. Unfortunately we arrived at 8:40pm on a Friday night.  They close at 9pm.  The cook made some eye rolling face looking at the clock and the hostess said ‚Äúit‚Äôs 20 ‚Ä¶
28,Zen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Blake is a master,  go see him and ask him for one of his own creations off the menu. Blake will blow you away, the tsunami is my favorite but he‚Äôs got a ton of cool ones. Paradise is another great one.  Best sushi I‚Äôve ever eaten and I‚Äôve been eating it for 30 years"
29,Zen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I have traveled quite a bit up and down the west coast. This restaurant has the best samishi I have had, hands down. We had a sampling of 5 types and also ordered rolls. All were excellent! We will be back! We cannot say enough about the service and the food."
30,Zen, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Some might consider me a sushi snob. I eat sushi wherever I go. Reno, San Fran, wherever... I ate at Zen Zen last night because the reviews on Google were 4.5 stars... ya... umm.. no! Average at Best is an over statement. Yes the fish was ‚Ä¶"
31,Zen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Every time I go the Zen Zen sushi everyone is so nice and welcoming. The food is amazing and glorious to look at and taste. I will come back very soon and tell my family and friends.
32,Zen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I dont normally complain about restaurants but this place has Horrible Sushi and slow service, one roll wasn't a crunchy as specified on the menu, and the other one that was actually deep fried was undercooked and pasty.  It took forever to ‚Ä¶"
33,Zen, 5 stars ,8 years ago,Consistently excellent. I eat here at least once a month for lunch and am always impressed. The bento box is fun to eat and freshly prepared. Sushi looks great and friends love it. Plenty of food for lunch or dinner. Casual atmosphere with good prices for the amount/quality of food you get.
34,Zen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"two days ago was the first time we visited this excellent restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last time. We had great time with the efficient service, with the finest  meal and fine drinks and with the modest cost. We will no doubt return there again."
35,Zen, 1 star ,2 years ago,Their rolls are tiny and 90 percent are cooked. I asked the cook what he recommended for more traditional sushi he said rainbow roll which had fake crab and green salmon that had shrimp tempura. They have American sushi not sushi sushi
36,Zen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food, i loved the vibe. And the employees are very friendly.."
37,Zen, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"New to Sushi, they make it easy on the newbs! Lol everything is really tasty, I haven't had anything bad, even when I accidentally ordered eel instead of eel sauce, I ate it, and was shocked! My favorites there are the cucumber salad, ‚Ä¶"
38,Zen, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I‚Äôve always loved the central point rolls they have here but 90% of the time I order them they always make it wrong. I can‚Äôt stand wasabi and I ask for none in the box and none of the wasabi sauce on top either but they always put them on, ‚Ä¶"
39,Zen, 1 star ,6 years ago,The worst sushi meal I have ever had. The fish was old and it had ice crystals in it because it was just taken out of the microwave. I watched assist sushi chef go to the back pull frozen fish out of the freezer and put it in the microwave. ‚Ä¶
40,Zen, 5 stars ,8 years ago,This place is seriously the best! I am always going here to get my sushi. No other place compares to it. It is the most delicious food in Southern Oregon. If you haven't been here it is a must!
41,Zen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We drive over from Klamath Falls just to eat here...because it‚Äôs always that good!!! Sushi is always yummy, bento is perfect, and teriyaki spot on. Our family always enjoys our visits to this restaurant. üëç"

45,Zen, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Very cute place and clean! We had the king roll , teriyaki chicken, and beef and it was all delicious!! Quick service and friendly people. We'll definitely be going back."
46,Zen, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I love ZenZen the food and sushi are amazing. It's the amount of time it takes to get your food. It takes forever! Really kind of ridiculous that it takes an hour to get a sushi roll. Boyfriend got his teriyaki chicken in like 20 minutes.
47,Zen, 2 stars ,6 years ago,Went out to celebrate tonight. Love sushi and supporting my local neighborhood businesses. I worked in restaurants for half my life and was damn good at it. So I have a pretty high bar when it comes to dining experiences. But this is a ‚Ä¶

55,Zen, 1 star ,6 years ago,I love zenzen and great sushi. But I don't like the fact that knowing my tip doesn't.... go to my server... not cool... and Jack Johnson ....used to love Jack Johnson can't stand to listen to him now
56,Zen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Have ordered here a few times and food was ok. Always get steamed broccoli and I called to order the same thing and girl said they can't do it because they don't have a steamer, um ok? I said I was going to order somewhere else and she hung up."

65,Zen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's good, wasabi isn't in between raw fish and rice. so if you want that you have to tell them."
