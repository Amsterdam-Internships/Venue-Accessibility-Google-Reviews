0,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I have to say, this is the best Japanese sushi I‚Äôve had by now in Amsterdam. I will definitely go back for another nice meal. I love their sushi! Good job!"
1,tomo sushi, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"They had problems with pay machine and we couldn‚Äôt pay with any credit card, we should went out to look for some atm. The food was good but overpriced"
2,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 months ago,A really nice Japanese restaurant with humble employees and good food for a fair price.
3,tomo sushi, 1 star ,7 months ago,The portion sizes are ridiculously small. The 5 pc sashimi is equivalent to 2 pcs because they are so thin and small. The prices don't reflect the sizes given. You have to spend too much to get full and us not worth the price. The quality isn't bad. The portion sizes however are unacceptable.
4,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,6 months ago,One of those places where everything is spot on! Definitely worth trying if you‚Äôre in the mood for some Japanese / sushi!
5,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Last Sunday 9 Feb was incredibly windy. Actually it was stormy but we took the risk and we went out for dinner at Tomo Sushi. It is located in the city centre close to Rembrandt square. It was a quiet place. Of course most of the people ‚Ä¶
6,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Excellent food, pleasant and hospitable service. Prices on the medium to high side, especially 1.50 for a glass of tap water seems a bit avaricious. The music, jazzy easy listening, might be toned down a bit. But I would gladly go there again."
7,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing sushi!
Extremely fresh fish, very nice staff and a great experience!!
A true Japanese restaurant.
I'll definitely come back. Thanks!"
8,tomo sushi, 1 star ,2 months ago,"The sushi rice was dry as if It were datos ago, the salm√≥n smelled bad, in the vegetarian sushi i found pieces of tuna or i don't know what fish, and on the phone the manager very unpleasant he didn't want to change the dishes, expensive and horrible, I had throw everything away"
9,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Soooo tasty! Nice service, beautiful but small place. Perfect for dates"
10,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,a year ago,"A nice restaurant with friendly staff. Make a reservation as it gets busy, and note that the rolls are quite small so you may need to order more than expected. Sashimi was fresh (we just had the scallops) and ingredients overall were pretty good. Nothing blew me away but I would come again."
11,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best sushi I've ever had
The food was so perfectly good and the service was lovely while the place looks very cozy! ‚Ä¶"
12,tomo sushi, 1 star ,2 months ago,"I went to the restaurant to pick up my order and I saw how they dropped an order on the floor and he returned it to the taper, when I reproached him that it was dirty he told me not to worry that it is not for me. I decided to cancel my order and the guy got very aggressive. a shame"
13,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We tried so many dishes. They were all delicious. Sushi was fresh.  Also make a great latte.
14,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,a week ago,Excelent service and staff ! Delicious Shashimi and Sushi rolls ! üòç
15,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Amsterdam. Almost tried everything. My favourite are the hotategai and chirashi, they are a real treat! They also have grilled meat which are very good. The service is fast and friendly."
16,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Quality sushi, nice atmosphere. I sampled a set of nigiris and I was pleasantly surprised. Toro and uni highlighted this lovely meal. Highly recommendable for those who know and appreciate good quality sushi."
17,tomo sushi, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Got a take away for the first time today. The sushi was nothing special, the quality did not feel superior and therefore I thought it was very overpriced for what it is. First and last time ordering here."
18,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Lovely cozy place. Loved their sushi. Service is beyond expectations. Well done!
19,tomo sushi, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great service and location. The food tasted good but the portions were super small and it was over priced for what you get. I hope they will have a combo for veggie sushi as buying everything separate adds up.
20,tomo sushi, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Summary: Taste was good after all. Presentation of the food could have been better. ‚Ä¶
21,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Beautiful interior, staff was super nice, squeezed us in without reservation, sushi was amazing and service was on point. Will defly come again!"
22,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hidden in an alley, not at a very obvious spot. The perfect place to have a decent Japanese dinner. Friendly and customer oriented staff. Reservation is strongly recommended or you will end up sitting at the bar side."
23,tomo sushi, 1 star ,2 months ago,"I found hair in my food, the fish smelled bad and the sushi was all wasted, and also when I called to complain he hung up twice when I told him that the fish was bad, I do not recommend this restaurant, it is expensive for such poor quality food."
24,tomo sushi, 1 star ,11 months ago,We ordered online and we are highly disappointed. The sushi was nothing special. Freshness was questionable. The sushi was not rolled good and it smelled. The dumplings were dry and we had the feeling they came out of the freezer. Hopefully ‚Ä¶
25,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good service, decent sushi but not prime and fresh cuts. Cosy atmosphere.

28,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great authentic Sushi place.  I recommend tea and hot sake with it.
29,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice cozy restaurant, not japanese owned but the quality is close enough. Had tasty beef lunch here and the price was reasonable ( in Amsterdam)"
30,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A hidden gem! It‚Äôs a small resto in an alley, not easy to find but really a must-go. All the staffs are Japanese so you will get the fine quality food, and the warm, elegant polite service."
31,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Excellent sushi. Have been going there for more than 10 years. Same level of quality that when i visit the fish market in tokyo.
32,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy place with lots of choice, the staff is very attentive when you need any help or want something. The food tasted great."

34,tomo sushi, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice place, good food...really good...but there's not no stop, so too much expensive!!!"
35,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered Chef's Special Maguro ""Toro"". Softest Tuna I have tasted in my life ever, melted away. Full Foodgasm. Everything else (service, setting etc) are great too!"
36,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,a year ago,We ordered a couple of sushi including Unagi and Spider maki. They were both great with good portions. The price was a bit on the higher end comparatively. But the seafood was fresh and taste really good.
37,tomo sushi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I can‚Äôt believe they charge ‚Ç¨1.5 for a glass of tap water. Food is okay. Portion is small but delicious.
38,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Fantastic sushi and sashimi, everything was so fresh and almost melting on the tongue. Service was quick and very polite. We sad outside and it was lovely. They where also very service minded as to make sure everything was gluten-free when we asked for it. Highly recommend this lovely restaurant"
39,tomo sushi, 1 star ,a year ago,"Just for the record, normally I don't complain, but I have to warn you. We ordered for ‚Ç¨82 Sushi. It arrived extremely fast. It was made in a rush without any care. Almost all pieces fell apart. The sushi pieces were very tiny. Most of the ‚Ä¶"
40,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely delicious! The freshest, tastiest sashimi and sushi, perfectly cooked beef and delicious prawn tempura! We had such a great evening here, so lucky to get a table on a busy night. Service was impeccable. We will be back for sure! Thank you!!!"

They where also very service minded as to make sure everything was gluten-free when we asked for it. Highly recommend this lovely restaurant"
42,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The quality and the taste of the sushi is very good and solid. The waiters were very friendly and since the restaurant is quite small they payed a lot of attention. ‚Ä¶
43,tomo sushi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Ordered here, way too expensive. Fine quality fish, but made in a rush and without any care. Sushi pieces fell apart, barely have  taste had hard avocado in it etc. Would never recommend."

45,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Lovely place, great food and drinks. Would definitely recommend the Fatty Tuna Nigiri!"
46,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Walked a good distance to have dinner here. Well worth the walk. Not just another tourist sit-eat-leave with low quality. Sat outside at one of the 4 table tops. Great staff. Perfect menu to accommodate most all sushi lover and non with ‚Ä¶
47,tomo sushi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The service was very nice but the food was fine. I was very underwhelmed by the rolls, especially the spicy tuna, and appetizers but thought the nigiri was good. This is not in the same league as the great sushi restaurants in Amsterdam but I don't think they try to play there"
48,tomo sushi, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good not great. Nothing really that special. The sushi is fine, the yakitori also fine. But nothing that exciting. 8-10 years ago when I last lived in
Amsterdam it was some of the best around. Now very middle of the road."

52,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic service. First time in and the guy who served me recommended some really nice things. Pricier than other sushi places perhaps but it is good quality so no complaints about price. It‚Äôs not an all you can eat type establishment, ‚Ä¶"
53,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have tried a lot of sushi restaurants and take-out places in Amsterdam (and elsewhere), but Tomo really has the best sushi I have ever had. I'm also a big wine lover and the wines they have here are impeccable and great great great quality for what you are paying!!! I would really recommend going here."
54,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Bit expensive for small portions but was very delicious
55,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing, freshly made sushi, really nice and attentive servers and the restaurant interior was stylish and the chairs very comfortable. Me and my friend were very surprised and happy to see our favourite plum wine from our time in Japan on the menu!"
56,tomo sushi, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The people that wrote all of those reviews saying that this place is a gem must've never tried decent sushi before for God sake!!! ‚Ä¶

58,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 months ago,High quality authentic sushi!!
59,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My boyfriend an me found this place by accident while on vacation in Amsterdam. If you are a fan of sushi you need to visit this place. Amazing sushi of high quality and very polite and friendly service as well. Always worth a visit.
60,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"The best sushi I've had in Amsterdam so far, and I've been looking for a while. There's a wider selection of fish and different dishes, so you can be a little adventurous here and expand your tastes.  It's not hugely expensive either, so if ‚Ä¶"
61,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The sushi was very good, as well as the sake. Excellent choice!"
62,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Fantastic sushi, some of the best I've had anywhere, which combined with excellent, attentive service and a nice atmosphere made for a great meal. I would thoroughly recommend Tomo Sushi. ‚Ç¨70 bought enough for two people to have to be ‚Ä¶"
63,tomo sushi, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Expensive and small portions of sushi and rice. Groya is horrible as well. Very overrated, wouldn‚Äôt recommend"
64,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tomo Sushi is wonderful restaurant. The restaurant is small and cozy with a bar next to the kitchen and counter, and a section with restaurant tables. The restaurant serves authentic Japanese food and drinks. The food is prepared very well with eye for detail. The staff is friendly."
65,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Really good service! Really friendly and welcoming! Food was good too, maybe not the best sushi of Amsterdam but good enough."
66,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I went here for my birthday. Amazing sushi, decent prices, and the staff were so great! They gave me dessert with a big sparkler, and we hadn‚Äôt asked them to do that! I had the best time here!"
67,tomo sushi, 1 star ,11 months ago,"Ordered gyoza and a sushi/sashimi set; gyoza was completely burnt, cut in half (?) and placed on a bed of green salad (?). sushi and sashimi were below average"
68,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful experience. Tomo sushi is the meal time experience you wish to get after a long day or when you really need a good time. The food is heavenly good (specialy the temakis like waaaw), the staff is suuupeer kind and helpful and the kitchen is lighting fast. I recommand of course!!"
69,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Have eaten here many times the selection is great with the service to match. It can be busy so it maybe best to reserve although they have accommodated me many times without one. If no tables are available sitting up at the sushi bar watching the chefs prepare the dishes is fun. See you soon Tomo
70,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very friendly service and superb food!
71,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Clean and cozy place. Sushi is delicious, much better than average taste. They have japanese whisky (like yamazaki , hibiki), sake, green tea and sapporo bier (but they don t have asahi bier) You may sit on the tables or on the bar table in front of chefs."
72,tomo sushi, 1 star ,11 months ago,Never ordering from your restaurant again.  I‚Äôve been a customer for a long time.  I ordered food for delivery and it never came.  I called you and you assured me it would be there shortly. It never ever showed up.
73,tomo sushi, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Very fresh, friendly staff but the price is way too high. 20-30% too much."
74,tomo sushi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Super expensive sushi, not even enough for a 2 year old. Quality is average, service is average too. If I could do it again I would rather go to Sumo where you can get twice as much sushi for 25-30 euros a person."
75,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Beautiful sushi, beautiful service. As I write this I'm hoping to squeeze one last trip in this evening before I leave Amsterdam. I would say, if you think you've ordered enough, just go ahead and order a bit more because you will ‚Ä¶"
76,tomo sushi, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Extremely unfriendly! We booked a table for two and noted down, that we will bring our little, friendly dog with us. We were looking forward to a nice dinner, but were turned down due to our dog. Very unprofessional since we got a confirmation before! Never again!"
77,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great sushi restaurant in the heart of town, quality very high, great baked green tea, amazing sake, very clean place and great atmosphere."

85,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice place to have fresh and tasty sushi. Friendly and quick service. We love this place.
86,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Very fresh and very good sushi and other Japanese dishes. Better than most others. They don't do 'all you can eat'. They're also a little more expensive than the usual sushi places.
87,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good sushi overall but nothing exceptional. The place is nice but prices are expensive. Better makr reservation in advance through website (takes 2 minutes) because it is small place and popular
88,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent chirashi, in fact, so good we went back there times in a single week. The fish is fresh, service is quick, and prices are reasonable. Reservations are recommended."
89,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Nice sushiplace next to the busy Rembrandtsplein. Its not big but the sushi is way better than I suspected in this area. Everything was fresh and nice. When we come back to Amsterdam we will try another menu here.
90,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Authentic Japanese restaurant. Unexpected in the area. Delicious food and attentive service. Cater for Gluten Free with a wide selection. We left full and satisfied :)
91,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I've been here 3 times now. It's turned into my favorite sushi spot in Amsterdam. It's small and hard to get seats but it's worth the wait!
92,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff here are really friendly, and the food is really good. however, I found it to be bazaar that they charge 1.50 euro for tap water. Never experienced this at a restaurant."
93,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Sushi, very kind service.
Update march 2020: still a good place to eat sushi at a reasonable price. Small place, better book

This place takes pride in their food and only uses high-quality fresh ingredients.  Definitely going back here."
95,tomo sushi, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My friend and I visit Tomo for our monthly dinner/movie date. It is always great: the staff are friendly, the food delicious (always a nice amuse and I can definitely recommend the dragon roll) and if the weather is good you can sit outside in the sun."

97,tomo sushi, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious melt in the mouth food.. Must try when in Amsterdam
