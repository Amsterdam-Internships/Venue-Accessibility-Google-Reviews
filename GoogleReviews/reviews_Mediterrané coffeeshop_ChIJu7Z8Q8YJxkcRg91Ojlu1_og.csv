0,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 5 stars ,a month ago,Shiny bright shop with incredible cali flowers. Nice friendly knowledgeable budtender
1,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best coffee shop in my opinion. Cheap prices for marijuana and has 2 sections for seating, the first isn't very good as the seats are long stools and the table is quite small but there is about 7 tables and there are lots of stools so ‚Ä¶"
2,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Our fav coffeeshop in Amsterdam. Great vibe, good prices!!"
3,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We found this coffee shop by accident but this was our favourite shop that we visited during our time in Amsterdam. Staff were friendly and helpful and recommended products. The atmosphere was very chill and it wasn't that busy too which was nice. Toilets was very clean. Overall I would recommend this coffee shop
4,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,Bought 5 gr of lemon haze. But it seems they forgot to put the THC in the bag. Smoked 2 gr in my bong and nothing happened. Very disappointing. The only positive thing I can say about this shop is that the staff is friendly.
5,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very good stuff, a little bad seating arrangement. Pit bull works here lol"
6,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Never got to smoke in this place, I walked in, asked for two drinks and was advised I had to purchase weed to consume my drinks and sit in the coffeeshop. I immediately declined. Very disappointing as I heard good things. ‚Ä¶"
7,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Alex & Marcos are the best bud tenders I've been coming to the dam for 20yrs now. They always remember me & even better what I like the orange bud & super polm is my favourite & I like to start my trip with the first stop in mediterrane`. ‚Ä¶

9,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great spot to come chill. Very good value for the price and quality. Inside the glass room you can smoke cigarettes because of the air vacum ventilation system. The usually have a a futbol game on and cool music. Internet computer stations are also available

11,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best coffee shop I‚Äôve been to, had the best weed I smoke there ( Cali orange cookie), nice drinks and I could always get a good seat not feeling squashed up like in most cafes"
12,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The place certainly wasn‚Äôt crowded, and there was loads of tables free. We just wanted a coffee as it was so cold, but they said we have to buy some weed too or leave."
13,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Bought space cake, when i asked the guy how strong it was he rudely said medium, as if i was ment to know. Bought a drink and sat down to eat cake and smoke, guy came round stacking chairs as loud as possable in area i was at (not closing up as it was around 5) making me feel unwanted in the shop"

15,Mediterran√© coffeeshop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,On a really quite street opposite to Dam Square. You might walk past thinking it's an Internet cafe but the beat of Bob Marley tunes drew us in. Little cubicle showing the best of European football made us sit for a while. Would have given a 3 but the chilled assistant earned it another ‚≠êÔ∏è Chocoloco and a flat white plsüòâüòò
