0,Tante Roosje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We ate breakfast around the Reimbrandtplein every day on our trip and Cafe Tante Roosje is where we got the best food. This is the only cafe around the square that was always crowded in the morning for good reason. ‚Ä¶
1,Tante Roosje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ambiance, the space is decorated very nicely, the space has ... something.  The waiters are kind, and prices are a little higher, but at the level of Amsterdam."
2,Tante Roosje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, just in front of Rembrant Square..
Good food, best drink!"
3,Tante Roosje, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Worthless. Bloody Mary on the menu, but the waitress says they don't do that ! She brings me a glass of tomato Juice suppose to have vodka in it. It looks more like tomato Juice mixed with water... 9.50‚Ç¨. A bit expensive to drink a tomato juice. Don't go there if u wanna have a good drink. Waitress not friendly at all."

5,Tante Roosje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great cafe along a park square. Triple toasted sandwich was amazing. Serve beer for breakfast and you can smoke cigarettes in the outdoor seating area, which as an American, is something we can't do. Will definitely visit again."
6,Tante Roosje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Can't really remember a lot of the night I was in there but as my intention was to go in and do exactly that I guess its good! from what I can remember the atmosphere was great with lots of singing and the bar staff where really friendly to us even though the majority of the people drinking in there were locals.
7,Tante Roosje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cafe Tante Roosje quickly became one of my favorite places to grab lunch while in Amsterdam. If you‚Äôre lucky Rodney will help you out during your visit. Always extremely kind and welcoming. Definitely a major part of the decision to keep ‚Ä¶
8,Tante Roosje, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good atmosphere.  I went for a drink at night and had a great time.  Local bar with mixed music and good service with relation to the amount of individuals present in this establishment.  Basically the timing of drinks was great and better than expected.

12,Tante Roosje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best food we have had in Amsterdam! Wish we had found this place sooner. Hotdog was massive and the presentation was lovely. Toilets were also the cleanest we have seen.
13,Tante Roosje, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Waiter cleaned the table into my lap without apologizing, the omelet with mushrooms was pretty tasteless even with added salt. We were asked if the food tasted OK, but if the problem is poor quality then it is not much you can do. Drinks, OK maybe will go back, food, no thanks."
