16,smaaQt, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"One star for interior, one for chlorine smell from toilets and therefore clean. We waited (only 4 tables occupied) for 15 minutes and no one made the effort to ask us for our lunch needs... so we left and the waiter did not even bother to look up"
17,smaaQt, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Yawn. They serve an astonishingly boring and outdated menu of ham, burgers and carpaccio, with just one vegetarian option for lunch. That option is just a slice of airy supermarket style bread, weighed down by an entire goat's cheese and honey. At 8,50 I would expect more. Staff was friendly though."
