0,The Lobby, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great Food combined with excellent wine pairing. Awesome experience. Highly recommended also the bar with its fantastic Cocktails and Irish cafe provision. Unfortunately forgot the name of the Italien woman with her special cocktail shaking skills. Second to none
1,The Lobby, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice restaurant underneath the hotel. In the summertime their terrace is a good spot for a fine dinner. The cook's creativity and the friendly waiters are making it a perfect night out. Tip (if you like a good cocktail that is): Ask for their own version of Aperol that's not on the menu. üôÇ
2,The Lobby, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Good food, good atmosphere, nice staff. Came by for an afternoon brunch and had a lovely time. We Ordered the eggs Royal and the Flammkutchen, with a side a fries. We were stuffed and able to sit and chat in the space for ages. Will definitely be back soon."
3,The Lobby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"In short: hidden gem for great lunches & dinners. Excellent staff, beautiful and spacious interior. And every dish I've tried so far is a delight. ‚Ä¶"
4,The Lobby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was an unexpected surprise and an extra bonus having this place where i am staying in the Hotel V Fizeaustraat in Amsterdam.
It was unusual when they told me i have to make a reservation in advance , ‚Ä¶"
5,The Lobby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very impressive dinner at the hotel restaurant. I was surprised on the quality, plating, flavors and the play on textures. ‚Ä¶"
6,The Lobby, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We went to the restaurant by walking it was kind of far from the old town, the servers were very kind and professional however the food was very fancy and it was quite hard to find an appropriate meal, if you love raw and undercooked meat ‚Ä¶"
7,The Lobby, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The Lobby, it's on the ground floor of Hotel V.

Interior is warm and golden. Tables are not to close to each other, so you'll ‚Ä¶"
8,The Lobby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Seriously great place. Food is fine and greatly made. Service is also fine. Best part here is the wine! That is exactly what you are going for here.
9,The Lobby, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Me and my family had Christmas breakfast here, the interior is modern and and food was fine. I ordered Egg Benedict but apparently my egg was overcooked. Not outstanding service, nothing good or bad. Just a normal restaurant I would say."
10,The Lobby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food with nice presentation, the wine menu is also good. The staff is kind and the place so beautiful."
11,The Lobby, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great ambiance and food! Beautiful setting and the food was surprisingly good as well! Only if the staff was a bit quicker with drinks it would have definitely a 5 star place.
12,The Lobby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam. Excellent, thoughtful and surprising food and wines in the restaurant. Awesome burgers, fries, flammkuchen, and cocktails in the bar. Great service all around and fab interior design and sunny terrace in the evenings. Always my #1 choice for a nice evening out."
13,The Lobby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stylish, modern and chic. Had very pleasant breakfast there. Good looking Male waitresses."
14,The Lobby, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Didn't let us in coz wasn't staying in hotel, you can change the status to Closed and notify your guests about it. Walked 20 minutes for egg Benedict in the morning and it's not okay ‚Ä¶"
15,The Lobby, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Completely overrated! Slowest service ever, very poor variety in the menu (even some dishes were not available) and very expensive for the quality/amount of food."
16,The Lobby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pretty expensive, and kinda slow service, very small portions, but good food and excellent atmosphere. I had the cilbir eggs which were very nice. The eggs benedict were also made to perfection. Would return, especially nice for a date."
17,The Lobby, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delivered The Lobby is very close to actual The Lobby! They take a lot of care in their menu, and then the package is really top notch!! They really want you to have the The Lobby experience at home, so you get everything you need for ‚Ä¶"
18,The Lobby, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Great hotel and restaurant.  The staff is amazing and they always have vegan options on the menu or ad hoc. Fabulous wine list and cocktails too. My favourite hang out spot omin Amsterdam. PS: superb terrace!
19,The Lobby, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"(The restaurant and cafe) Great design, cosy interiors, good (but not outstanding) food, And a very lame and slow service. The service becomes o.k. when the crew finally discovers you! Took 30 mins to get my orders."
20,The Lobby, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We enjoyed a great dinner with very tasteful courses and delicious desserts!
21,The Lobby, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The menu is perfectly executed. Dishes incredibly well balanced. A joy to eat here. Well done kitchen. Service was pleasant. We felt comfortable, well looked after and safe. We were able to enjoy the same experience we have always enjoyed at The Lobby. Well done üëäüèº See you soon"
22,The Lobby, 5 stars ,a year ago,Service was very attentive and professional. Food was tasty and the setting was nice. We chose a little wrong and went for a starter (the menu was a little weird and very starter based). Which was too small and didn‚Äôt really fill us up. We ‚Ä¶
23,The Lobby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I've been here with a work event, where most of things were taken care off. The lunch was okay-ish. The building itself is very nice setup on the ground floor with all the decorations. Funny, since it's very ugly from the outside"
24,The Lobby, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing food experience and rarely seen excellent service!
25,The Lobby, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Great place to meet, lunch‚Äôs and have drinks."

32,The Lobby, 1 star ,5 months ago,The BEST thing of this restaurant is the exit door... what a poor and sad experience.
33,The Lobby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cool and hip restaurant that is known for multiple courses. I did a two course and some others did 3 and 4. Food is very gourmet feel and it's fun to try different types of food since portions are so small. Bit pricey though.  Got the ‚Ä¶
34,The Lobby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A total shock. I have to say, in all my years of travelling the globe, I have never... ever... considered eating in the hotels restaurant. It just wouldn't occur to me, as 99 times in 100 its complete garbage. And I must add, we never ‚Ä¶"
35,The Lobby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best restaurant in Amsterdam oost. Perfect ambiance and perfect service. Legendary Espresso Martinis.
36,The Lobby, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good coffee, good food, good athmosphere. Great place for a breakfast"
37,The Lobby, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The starter and between dish were absolutely fantastic. The main and desert I found to be less special and worth it. Ultimately paid around 150 for the 2 of us. Service was great. However, would not come again as to me the price/quality is out of balance."
38,The Lobby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I just love this place! Serving hotel guests and locals the like this restaurant has a very nice and laid back vibe despite of the high level of gastronomy and service. Staff is mainly pro and aiming to give you the best experience possible. Sommelier at your request. Highly recommended!
39,The Lobby, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great place for lunch or meeting. Food is well prepared and the design of the place is modern but cosy. The meeting place has a fireplace
40,The Lobby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I really liked this place, amazing fine dining experience, good choices and great wine pairing. It was my first time, however friends told that the menu doesn't change much. I would definitely visit again if they change the menu, since I think I ate almost everything I liked from the menu :)"
41,The Lobby, 2 stars ,3 years ago,We had breakfast there one morning and the waitress was very rude to us right away.  When she was with the other customers we could hear her talking friendly with them. My fiance also found a hair on his brownie.  We had already paid for the breakfasts for days we were there and we didn't go back.  My food was really good.
42,The Lobby, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was excellent, very friendly staff and the place itself is cozy and elegant. Food thought is not on par with the price point. The starters were just ok, and the point of the main dish (large meat dish - I guess cote du boeuf) came rare, almost bleau, although we ordered medium, so quite far away from what we ordered."
43,The Lobby, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favourite in Amsterdam. Beautiful decorated in 70's style.  Very cosy. Good food and even better wines, but could also be the other way around. Parking below the restaurant if you plan to drive by yourself. Enjoy!"
44,The Lobby, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The kitchen team really knows their stuff; creative combinations in all 3 courses we had beautifully paired with the suggested wines. The ambiance is semi-industrial meets seventies cosy and the staff is friendly. You do need to make reservations.
45,The Lobby, 1 star ,3 years ago,EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTING. No host welcoming patrons in. I had reserved my table online and when I arrived they couldn‚Äôt find it even though I had the confirmation emailed to me. Very over priced and portion size was laughable. We had to ask ‚Ä¶
46,The Lobby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The Lobby is situated under the V hotel with a beautiful sunny garden/terrace (highly recommended in summer). They master the art of flammkuchen! Dinner is always delicious. Staff is very friendly. Service is very professional. I have not ‚Ä¶

48,The Lobby, 1 star ,3 years ago,"My friend and I had lunch at the lobby Fizeaustraat this Sept. noon with reservation and I would say it was the worst worst worst experience I have ever had, no matter the service or the food. The waitress let us wait for nearly an hour ‚Ä¶"
49,The Lobby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, creative dishes, lovely setting.
Menu confusing to say the least. Staff a mixed bag ‚Äî some v attentive while others less than service minded."
50,The Lobby, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful 50s-60s design, knowledgeable bartenders, strong wine list, great atmosphere. Food is good too (but a bit.more.originality would make the restaurant really stand out)"
51,The Lobby, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Cozy hotel restaurant with decent food!
52,The Lobby, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The latest addition to the lobby family, this one located near Amstel station. The terrace was surprisingly empty for a Sunday afternoon. On the menu we found some of our favorite dishes from a couple of years ago at their Nes location: the ‚Ä¶"
53,The Lobby, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for lunch. Somehow this place is always busy so check for reservation. They have a great combination of fusion Dutch food options.
54,The Lobby, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Went for a quick bite, staff are friendly. Drinks were okay and the food was not worth it. Ordered crispy chicken and it came raw, food poisoning followed! Place is overrated"

56,The Lobby, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great food at very reasonable prices. Also nice atmosphere inside!
57,The Lobby, 5 stars ,5 years ago,We had a private room as we were a group.  Food was amazing and service was good timed.  We has a set menu which I usually find disappointing but not this time.

60,The Lobby, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Interior is very well designed. Original style. Food looks amazing and is very good. Service is great, a bit too formal though."
61,The Lobby, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nicely laid out spot in a place you wouldn't expect. I'd give 5 stars, but price/quality and sometimes a bit messy service drags it down"
62,The Lobby, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Went there for second time but not as good as before. Waiter was new and not familiar with how the place was run. Several errors in service. Very dissapointing.
63,The Lobby, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice informal ambiance in an unexpected quiet Amsterdam area. But please change the poorisch bitterballen & install an epoint for bikes?
64,The Lobby, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Swanky atmosphere, food is good if a little pretentious for my preferences. The Lobby is definitely going for cool, and they pull it off with coherence."
