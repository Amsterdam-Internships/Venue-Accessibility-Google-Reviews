0,Royal98, 4 stars ,a month ago,Nice service and good Italien food. The location is really nice and the prices are fair. Unfortunately we had to wait a little bit for our food so only 4 stars.
1,Royal98, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The pasta is highly recommended. The pizza is good but can be more hot. The service and environment is nice. There is no many customers when i come at non-peak time at 1130am.
2,Royal98, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I ate there my first time and the food was delicious very nice staff and a good price. It doesn’t look good from the outside but great inside.
It’s very cozy and warm!"
3,Royal98, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"After the first time eating here we just had to come back for a second time. The cosy ambiance, excellent Italian food and the amazing hostess made us feel right at home. We tried the pizza margarita, vegetarian pasta and the mozzarella …"
4,Royal98, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This cafe is one of the best in Asmterdam City! The waiters were really nice and helpful! We will be back at Royal 98! We love you and your coffee beans :D thank you so much for the nice memories <3
5,Royal98, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"While the food was good, the service by one particular waiter was terrible until another by the name of ""Duniya"" wonderfully stepped in to assist after a 40 min delay in which our order was made but never put in. The original waiter …"
6,Royal98, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The decoration is top notch, the food, and particularly the pastries, is very good.
The service was quite slow but very friendly, overall we had a nice lunch there. …"
7,Royal98, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very good restaurant with a excellent service. Ask the pizza quattro formagi. It is not at the menu but it will be cooked for you like in Italy 👍
8,Royal98, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"This place was great when it first opened, but service has gone downhill more recently. The tables all seemed dirty and waitstaff was too overwhelmed and didn’t know what was on their own drinks menu…"
9,Royal98, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice venue but terrible coffee and bad croissant. Had ham and cheese cooked inside which I thought was cool, but when I tried it, the filling wasn’t spread well and there wasn’t much ham at all. Wouldn’t come back here for breakfast."
10,Royal98, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Got invited to this place. Eventhough the place was empty, it took a lot before our starters came and it took even longer before we got our pizza's. We were with a big group, but that's no excuse. The food was really tasty and warm, so maybe I come here again sometime."
11,Royal98, 5 stars ,a month ago,Excellent Italian food and the amazing hostess made us feel right at home.
12,Royal98, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Their pasta was amazing & the portion was really big! You can just order this without any starters or even a desert afterward.. they take long time to take your order which I did not like and some of the staff attitude was not up to the standards

16,Royal98, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"5 stars for the food, one less because a few of the staff are pretty rude. It's best to make an online reservation here on Google before you head to the restaurant, cause there's one really grumpy girl that wouldn't let you come in without …"

23,Royal98, 1 star ,4 years ago,Ordered Pasta with pesto and tomatoes. Pasta is sinking in oil. It's just disgusting mix of warm spaghetti and fresh vegetables. Impossible to eat! Stuff is not really friendly...

30,Royal98, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We ordered the spicy beef pizza and a seafood pasta dish and they're the nicest we've ever had them dishes! Definitely recommend if you're fancying a nice meal in Amsterdam! Waiters were also lovely and  helpful, a little slow but everything else made up for it."
31,Royal98, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Breakfast was lovely; eggs Benedict. Coffee was good and staff very friendly.
32,Royal98, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious but the service of the tall black waiterless wearing the glasses that had served our table was very unkind.  She threw a menu and a drink cup, said nothing, and threw a change of money, causing the coins to run out on …"
33,Royal98, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Service was very sub par. We where not greeted when we walked in or directed towards a table. Once we sat down we where asked our drinks I ordered a beer and my wife was still looking.  After 10 minutes nobody came back to ask what she …
34,Royal98, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great location for people watching. We only had a coffee and it was very good. Inside it is very clean and modern. Friendly staff.
35,Royal98, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very poor service and regular food. There were only two waitresses in the Cafe this morning and they could not handle the pressure. One of the waitresses was very irritated and simply threw our food and drinks on the table. The cappuccinos …
36,Royal98, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best meals I've had in a long time. The pizza's are great!! The aesthetics inside and out look amazing. The staff here are so friendly and welcoming, I felt right at home! Couldn't fault this place at all!!"

38,Royal98, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food. Poor service. Had to ask for butter twice and milk three times. Eventually had to go to counter to demand milk, my coffee had gone cold at this stage. Ordered a croissant with my breakfast and never arrived. Staff more interested in chatting to each other than serve customers. Food was excellent however."
39,Royal98, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We walked in and stood there for a while before anyone came over to us, even though the staff kept looking at us. Finally we were brought over to this table (pictured). We sat there for at least 5 minutes and ended up leaving because no one …"
40,Royal98, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place and food are amazing, but what made our day very special was the lovely Vietnamese lady Ms. Loiesa, although the place was crowded, the smile never leaves her face and she does everything she can to make sure everyone is happy. Me and my wife came back just because of that. Thank you Loisa, you really made our day👍"
41,Royal98, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So we tried the Appleflap Danish. And I'm not an apple pastry person. I finished this and would have another one if I have the room.
42,Royal98, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, great service and nice atmosphere."
43,Royal98, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice restaurant, good location. I got milk there two times in one day. In the morning the server was very nice and helpful.

44,Royal98, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Loveley!
In all words of this place, I find lovely! The food, the staff and the design of the place itself is just lovely. Such a great atmosphere. A hidden treasure …"
45,Royal98, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice service. Food is pretty good. We had the soup and a sandwich and enjoyed them a lot. Dishes are a little small for the price but it is right on Dam square so location is very good. Worth a visit if you're looking for a small high quality lunch.
46,Royal98, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Cannot fault the food however the service left alot to be desired. I had made a reservation for 13 people for a Friday evening and was advised that due to the nber of diners a reduced menu would be offered which was no problem. When we …
47,Royal98, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely little place to eat, with a good beer menu, and well priced (unlike other hotels across the road). Lovely pasta, nice salad, sitting outside watching the very busy world go by. Friendly server, nothing to complain about at all."
48,Royal98, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely calming oasis to escape the hustle and bustle of Dam square. Just stopped in for a ginger tea.
49,Royal98, 1 star ,4 years ago,I don't usually write reviews but I felt I had to in this case. The food took absolutely ages and when it arrived it was burnt. When I told the waiter he laughed and offered a free drink but by that point my girlfriend and I just wanted to …
50,Royal98, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Descent food, but terrible customer service. I really enjoyed my spicy beef pizza. However, the wait staff was rude and never checked up on us. My friends also had to ask several times for their water, which was finally given in the middle of the meal."
51,Royal98, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"This was probably the worst steak I ever had. Medium rare was actually well done. Burger was cold. Wine list does not have names of the wine, just rapes categories. Good beer selection tho. I guess we should have pizza instead."
52,Royal98, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I really like the place and the waiters. cozy and friendly
53,Royal98, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The quinoa salad with chicken was an amazing choice!  Very good portion and food of good quality. Also we had the pleasure to have a table on the terrasse.  Perfect early afternoon lunch! …

55,Royal98, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Horrible customer service and mediocre food. We waited 15 mins to give our order and then waited about 25-30 mins for food and it wasn't the best pizza either. The waiters are just miserable and don't care about their job. Don't come here, save your money and time."
56,Royal98, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I've owned bars around the world so I know a bit about service. Seriously I have never witnessed the worst, other then this one. I understand the whole water bottle thing. I forgot I was in The Netherlands. I wasn't even drinking water and …"
57,Royal98, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the pizza and duo fries. Food was delicious, server was friendly and the atmosphere in the restaurant was nice. It's a bit pricey but what is expected in Amsterdam. Would recommend trying"

All is industrial nothing is homemade.
Excessively expensive price and when you order a glass of tap watter you take an …"

61,Royal98, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waitresses were extremely and incredibly rude with us and other customers as well.
They make unnecessary rude comments while stopping customers from entering saying that the place is full when its in fact not, probably because theyre lazy."
62,Royal98, 1 star ,2 years ago,Extremely rude staff. We waited for 20min at a dirty table which they did not bother cleaning. The restaurant was not busy and we were not given the menu as well. It  feIt almost like they wanted us to leave. So far worst experience in Amsterdam.
63,Royal98, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely the best pizza I've ever tasted, pulled chicken and mushroom, made fresh and we could see it being made. Nice chilled atmosphere and lovely staff."

68,Royal98, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Royal 98 was the first place we stopped at off the train and it set the rest of our Amsterdam trip off right. Great pastries and coffee. Only bad thing I can say is when leaving in the morning they were not open anywhere near opening time posted online.
69,Royal98, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good pizza and pasta, cozy and nice staff"
70,Royal98, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good place to eat and drink something near the centeral.
71,Royal98, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was not good, you really have to gesticulate to get any of the male servers to care. The drinks and food were decent if a bit overpriced... Still a great place to duck into and rest the feet for a few hours"
72,Royal98, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for a coffee during the day and enjoy a quiet whisky with a friend during the evening!
73,Royal98, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The restaurant is located very close to the dam square tourist areas. The service from the staff was quite slow, stood there for 3 minutes before any attention. The place is tastefully decorated with an open fireplace and comfy chairs. On …"

77,Royal98, 3 stars ,2 years ago,It is in prime location and staff is friendly but the combo of slow service and mediocre food won’t be a motivation for me to come back. I would rather grab a sandwich then wait 1 hr for a burger.

99,Royal98, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is really cool, especially unexpected in probably the most touristic are of the city. Pizza is baked in the wood oven, so it's definitely the real deal although the mix of ingredients proposed are a bit unusual but quite good."
100,Royal98, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Too bad I can't give it negative stars!!!! Don't come here if you're hungry. Very poor service... waiting on two basic burgers for a half hour and still counting.  I may just walk out, tired of waiting."
