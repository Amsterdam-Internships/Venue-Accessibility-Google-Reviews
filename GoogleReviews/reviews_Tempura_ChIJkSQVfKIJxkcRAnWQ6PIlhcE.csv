0,Tempura, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"A nice little restaurant. The lady who took our orders seemed strict but was polite. Food was tasty, portions on the smaller side for the price.
We were quite disappointed by the tea."
1,Tempura, 4 stars ,5 months ago,BBQ set menu was amazing. Udon tastes good too but sushi is not the best. The lady there was very friendly and nice.
2,Tempura, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fresh and awesome tasting Japanese food! Huge choice of combo menus and separate menu as well. Some would call it a bit pricey but I think it's worth it!
Hop in even for a little snack, you'd love it as well"
3,Tempura, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The lady was awesome and the food was nice.
4,Tempura, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing place. They have very tasty food and very helpful staff. I would highly recommend this to anyone who love sushi! Take away is very quick, only 5-10 minutes! Retains the taste and still hot! Just as good as eating in!"
5,Tempura, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The best sushi in Amsterdam. Really nice staff. Great price quality. Give it a try and you won't be disapointed!
6,Tempura, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"We enjoyed very much our food, the service was very good and polite."
7,Tempura, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Never seen such terrible service in my life, the waitress literally ripped the menu out of my hands and started shouting at me. She was completely disrespectful towards all of us and had no clue about how to run a business. DO NOT GO THERE!"
8,Tempura, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great sushi in a less touristy location. Been here several times and always have had great fresh sushi
9,Tempura, 1 star ,a year ago,Unfriendly and chaotic. They can not cope with more than one order. This is more like a friend who tries to cook than a restaurant. Avoid. There are much better options in Amsterdam.
10,Tempura, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great options and tasty food, wait times are short. Menu was a bit wet/sticky, but besides that a great easy dining experience."
11,Tempura, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good sushi place.. super crowded but we found a spot to sit and eat. The quality was great and service more then good. We choose not have set menus but selecting from the menu
12,Tempura, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"This was the first time my wife and I had tried sushi/sashimi so I honestly cannot tell if it was great, rubbish or indifferent in comparison to other restaurants. …"
13,Tempura, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Food served quite slow and the Japanese rice was not really Japanese rice.. Not really like sushi in proper Japanese restaurants. Also most menu are salty and not really reasonable amount to price. However I would give the 2 stars for attentive staffs. They are nice.

19,Tempura, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Horrible... sushi isnt good, the rice is not well cooked, and the inside sushui is poor, not creative. The price dont justify the place and food. Search another japonese restaurant."
