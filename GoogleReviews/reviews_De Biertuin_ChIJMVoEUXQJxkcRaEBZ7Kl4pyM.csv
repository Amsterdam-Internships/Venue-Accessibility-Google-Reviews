0,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great selection of beers. Knowledgeable staff. Beers are properly stored, but due to that served colder than their ideal serving temperature. Take some time to let your beverage warm up to the recommended drinking temperature.
Good selection of finger food and small dishes. They do accept credit cards."
1,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great spot with friendly staff and finger-linking good chicken and spare-rips. The Bratwurst is a bit lagging but this have no impact on the overall rating. Highly recommend this place.
2,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place with a huge variety of biers. It's a local place, which is a bit outside of the centre and far from the tourist crowd. Burgers are okay, but it is better not to try the chicken burger. Prices are OK, totally normal in Amsterdam."
3,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Service: fast, consistent, accurate, friendly
Location: beautiful (outdoors patio)
Food: beef burger with butter bun was very good ‚Ä¶"
4,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is always full! Regardless of the day. Probably because they have a great beer selection, and the food is quick and of quality. The No.9 tram takes you straight there. Open until 3am on weekends! Great place to go for a session with friends"
5,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere, people are chilled the staff is super professional and friendly. The beer selection is good the food as well. Enjoy sitting outside overlooking the tropenmuseum cheers!"
6,De Biertuin, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The Beer was good but despite the reviews I felt the food lacking. I have to say that I am from NYC so perhaps I'm biased about my ribs and burgers so take that for what it's worth. The burger was on par with Shake Shack but with with a ‚Ä¶
7,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Being one of popular places to go, de Biertuin offers an excellent variety of local and domestic beers, as well as cocktails and stronger types for the not so faint-heart beverages enthusiasts. If you rather want to visit when it is not too crowded, visit after dinner, let say after 21:30."
8,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome atmosphere in the day time and even more so in the evening, 1st time here I think the staff saw us looking a bit perplexed at the menu and offered us one in English (that obvious ayüòú) huge choice of larger and  IPA's really enjoyed our visits!"
9,De Biertuin, 1 star ,a month ago,"Turned my friend and I away saying too full. Two girls came behind us, smiled at the barman and they were let in, despite being told there was no space, they smiled and still got in."

11,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good beer selection and the burger I had was good. Big terrace out front, covered and heated."
12,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food. Great service and quite remarkable chicken's, perfect ""marination"" of the ribs. Belgium waffles were 8/10. Could be 1/10 crunchier and the last 1/10 is because it is not made by a Belgian. üòâ"
13,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"An example of how a beer garden should be! Great variety of beers, good food to accompany the beers and an awesome staff..keep it up"
14,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was simple, and delicious! Just the right amount of fancy for my pants. The beer list keeps me coming back for more!"

17,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Wow - an amazing place for beer lovers. The beer menu is stretched across 1 and a half very large pages, with a huge selection of bottles and a surprisingly long list on tap - as well as 3 guest taps where the choices are painted on the ‚Ä¶"

23,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I love this place! Very good food and a wide selection of beers.
24,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,a year ago,A large selection of beers and good food. Good service and a very casual vibe overall. The seating outside could be improved but I did spend 4 hours of my time over there.
25,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"They delivered the false burger but anyway, it was great... Perfect sweet potatoes üëçüèº. The brocollinis are pefect. Greetings from a german guy enjoying His Holiday"
26,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice terrace but don‚Äôt expect a real beer garden as it‚Äôs just a normal terrace

32,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,Absolute delicious food. The spareribs are amazing and i can really recommend the baked potatoes. I didn't thought that potatoes can be that good. Realy happy to find this awesome restaurant at our last day in Amsterdam. Totally worth a visit.
33,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Just an awesome place away from the crowds.. sssshhhhhhh! Overheerlijk! Veel dank!

36,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Really nice burgers and nachos, didn't have to wait very long, would recommend"
37,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place overall. I have no complaints about this bar whatsoever. It has a lot of seating but somehow each table feels very private. If you're looking for a bar to split a pitcher with friends this is the one for you. Anything on the menu is great but their fries are truly phenomenal.
38,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great terrace to chill after a long work day and, of course, enjoy an exquisite selection of the best local and international beers. Don't miss out on the burgers, all friends I take there rate these among the best they've had. Caesar salad is also a great choice. Staff is so nice you'll feel at home :)"
39,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We love their heated terrace and great selection of local beers üçª! Relax atmosphere and amicable staff. Sweet potatoes fries are delicious, pair them with a Zeezuiper! ‚Ä¶"
40,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great local place with an energetic atmosphere, great food, and a large beer selection. Family style seating is great for meeting new people, especially for solo travelers. The signature chicken dish was fantastic and unique to the area. ‚Ä¶"
41,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Stayed on the patio for a whole one evening. Great service and good food. Bitterballen are always my favorite. Waitress was very helpful in helping us pick new beers each time. A great time over all, would definitely go back."
42,De Biertuin, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been before and had snacks, and the beer selection is great, but their Ari Gold Burger is an absolute shocker and costs 16 euros without fries.  Woeful standard of bun, it's small and devoid of taste.  Definitely one to avoid."
43,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,a month ago,It looks like it was a quite windy last night ü§îüåÉ
44,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice burgers, friendly atmosphere"
45,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This place stays busy, so u might have to wait awhile for a drink. I love their cider selection so... that's not a complaint. It really is a beer garden because the have a large selection of all types of .beer."
46,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite a solid selection of beer. Had the Mexican inspired burger which was pretty good, though slightly under seasoned. Large outdoor patio nice for a night out with friends. Very nice staff, great service."
47,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great bar and restaurant. The servers are on the ball, the selection of drinks is great and the food is wonderful. They have a large outdoor terras with large picknick style tables. Inside is warm and has has kind of an open kitchen. Definitely recommend this place during nice weather, but it can get busy."
48,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great variety of beers on a menu and very tasty food
49,De Biertuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We saw this place was highly rated and looked good so we decided to try it. The beer selection was good and tasty, but while the menu looked really good, we had no service so we didn't get to try any. We ended up just paying for our drinks and walking out."
50,De Biertuin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely waitress. The food - only so so and kind of expensive for what you get. They take pride in their chicken - ... well, excuse me. I do better at home with what they call a half chicken is about the equivalent of a half a pigeon!... ‚Ä¶"
51,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food was great, best food so far!! Delicious üçü!  I can't count the beer's they serve here. Overall the best bar I went so far in Amsterdam."
52,De Biertuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Great selection of beer and the chicken is delicious, but unfortunately it has typical Dutch service. BAD! They waiters are unattentive and serve other people that arrived after you. It‚Äôs difficult to give a good rating when service is part of the experience."
53,De Biertuin, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a bit disappoint after  see so many good review.
I did not have good experience, on Sunday around 12:00 my hamburger was burned  it did not taste good. For burger i will not came back for a beer yes...  nice place maybe wasn't my day."
54,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best burgers i have ever tasted
55,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place to have a drink or eat some with good friends! They've really thought about the interior, so that's really neat. Overall a great place!"
56,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I like this place. It combines a great choice of beers, good food and small plates, and a covered outdoor seating. The con‚Äôs would be that it is quite popular and mostly always crowded, and waiters are sometimes overwhelmed by the amount of orders. But otherwise, it‚Äôs for me in the top-list of Amsterdam bars."
57,De Biertuin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly but careless staff. They were friendly but not polite. And the waiter asked us three times what we wanted instead of writing it down.
The roasted chicken was really good."
58,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Good food, good drinks, good service"
59,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Plenty of good beer brands and ok food. Go for the rendang fries. Staff is friendly and quick with the orders. Gets very busy inside, esp on a cold winter day"
60,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely outdoor seating area (but inside is pretty good too) and an excellent beer selection. Good service, always with a smile. Grilled chicken and superb burgers. Brilliant bitterballen."
61,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing atmosphere, the food is delicious and the service is clean. The people working there are exceptionally kind and disposable. Overall it's a friendly place, relaxing but at the same time lively. I'll definitely come back next time I'll be in Amsterdam."
62,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing find in the eastern part of the city! Amazing hospitality and service and the food was the best we had the whole time we were in Amsterdam! Definitely give it a try if you're in the area! With a selection of over 20 draught beers and amazing food there is something for everyone!
63,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice ambiance, lots of old wood and iron. Extensive selection of beers on draft. Had the Lellebel and the Bukowski. 10 EUR for the two of them. Spacious terrace out front. Friendly barkeep."
64,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is fantastic! Great food, wide selection of beers and the staff know everything about what beers they are serving. Usually pretty busy outside, a good sign, and well worth a visit."
65,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved this place on our trip to Amsterdam! All the beers are really strong (up to 11.5%)! The food is also great, I had the chicken burrito and it was great, came with all the nacho and sauce trimmings!"
66,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place to hang with friends, fantastic beers! Local ones and amazing beers from abroad too. Great and tasty snacks and bar food, but staff is sometimes great and sometimes, well, not so great, meaning not attentive. Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars."
67,De Biertuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A little disappointed from reading so many great reviews. The place itself is great, it‚Äôs ‚Äúgezellig‚Äù, whether it‚Äôs a weekday or weekend evening. Unfortunately, on two separate occasion, my order came about 30 minutes later and the food was ‚Ä¶"
68,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy place to sit outside even when it‚Äôs cold.
Variety of food and drink options, naturally quite a lot of beer choices.
The food itself is great with the fries being especially delicious."
69,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The original ""biertuin"" -> This place is really cosy and has the most amazing chicken. You can't book a table and it is usually quite crowded, so show up early or for lunch. ‚Ä¶"
70,De Biertuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I was in Amsterdam for 2-weeks doing a training at KIT. With only an hour lunch break, I was happy to find this sweet beer bar so close to my building. I was hoping to come by on a nice day, but sadly it was raining so I had to sit inside ‚Ä¶"

72,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The chicken is a most try! And they also have a very wide selection of special beers. Ask the waiters and tell them what you like and they will give you something that fits your taste budsüòä
73,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice place. Especially in sunny days the terrace is nice (and busy). Nice choice of beers on tap and bottle and burgers are also very decent.
74,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best chicken in town! The whole chicken in pieces is enough for two people. Very juicy and tasty, yet a good deal. I always bring guests there to try the chicken. Everybody just loves it!!!"
75,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent bar staff & very helpful in selecting the local brew. Recommend for beer üòÅ - it was late when I called so I can't comment on the food service.
76,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great beers, great menu! On busy days there's a wait so either come in time or be prepared to have a few beers before dinner"
77,De Biertuin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good selection of beers. Nice terrace. Service is a bit slow due to the number of waiters. Food is ok.
78,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Travelled from Ireland and stayed in Airbnb nearby. Drink where the locals drink,  what we wanted. Great to have local and not have to into the busy and kind of horrible tourist center.  Amazing bar (Uwit 7% larger I drank and it was ‚Ä¶"

80,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"No reservations, but if you ask for a table it is generally not a long wait. Good beer selection, but so not expect high abv specials"
81,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Brilliant, friendly bar/restaurant. Very friendly atmosphere and an amazing choice of beers too. Would highly recommend!"
82,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Were looking for somewhere to eat and get out the cold.  Saying that the outdoor part is heated to the point you would feel inside.  The food was amazing, the atmosphere was so relaxed, and the staff really friendly.  Loved it."

85,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Place for real beer. Real meat. Not so vegetarian-friendly. Great atmosphere.
Can get very busy so check the live indicator on the location!"
86,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent beer selection and delicious food served with it. I'd say best veggie burger and nacho's in town. Service is friendly, but it can be very busy."
87,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great beer selection, and good food.

One of my favourite areas to sit outside near Oosterpark. They have a great covered patio area with heat lamps."
88,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious beer, high quality food in generous portions and all at a fairly reasonable price for what you get considering the style of restraunt etc. ‚Ä¶"
89,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice beer garden, especially in the summer. They have big terras warmers so if it's chilly you can still sit outside. However it's pretty crowded most of the times."
90,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Students and tourists will love it.
Very good beers (local and common ones).
Tasty dishes and a cozy ""Biergarten"""
91,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Gezellig and delicious. The first place I go on every trip to Amsterdam! The nachos are as great a cure for jet lag as they are for hangovers, and the comprehensive selection of local beers allow for quick immersion into the Dutch culture! Try the Ijwit or the Tripel Carmeliet."
92,De Biertuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good selection of beer The food was great just the meat from the burger could be  from better quality it was a bit fat.

102,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely terrace, nice chill atmosphere. but if you're not a smoker, don't bother. The smoke is thick with nowhere to escape."
103,De Biertuin, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food lacked flavor and service was subpar. The Caesar salad dressing was unusual like mayonnaise and the croquttes were among the worst we've tried.
104,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice bar, with gluten free options"

117,De Biertuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty chicken sandwich and the fries were yummyyyyy!
118,De Biertuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"An alright burger, only downside is that for the price the fries are not included. So with fries you‚Äôre looking at almost a ‚Ç¨18 meal and then a beer. So not the cheapest option."
