25,Ku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Only the flamed edamame and the wagyu burgers deserve a visit here! Amazingly good, you cannot miss trying them. The bento box was great as well, and not to mention the tempura! Very nice cocktails, too, and very friendly staff! Definitely recommended!"

64,Ku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place for Japanese food. The sushi is great. Staff is friendly. You need to make a reservation to get a table, which I didn't know the first time, but if a chair at the bar is available, you can sit down and have a bite and a drink with no trouble."
65,Ku, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Very friendly, professional and handsome staff, cozy atmosphere, great food, especially the yakitori sticks"
66,Ku, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Food is good. However when ordering via Deliveroo for delivery, the prices of sushis are more than 50% higher than published on the menu of the website. 25,- euro for 8 sushis Hotel California (instead of 16,50 euro) excl. delivery and service fees..."
67,Ku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best Japanese restaurants I have been to in Amsterdam. The daily cocktail was a wonderful mule which was smooth and refreshing and had a lively kick of fresh chili. For starters we had the tempura vegetables and the silken tofu …
68,Ku, 3 stars ,4 years ago,2nd time there and I have to admit the service at the beginning was super fast but later was super late. We have ordered two dishes never came to our table. We have been waiting for half an hour...in this case the restaurant should at least …

71,Ku, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food. Came in just as they were opening. Started with the nicely seasoned and slightly grilled edamame then moved onto the tempura sea bass and shrimp, ""California"" roll and two other chef's special rolls. All very tasty. Great service and fun location."
72,Ku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ku Kitchen might just be my favorite restaurant in Amsterdam! The food, drinks, and atmosphere are unbelievable and the prices are exceedingly reasonable relative to other Japanese restaurants in the city and for the taste of what you're …"
73,Ku, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Service and interior was good. Sushi rice was too warm and the ratio of rice on the nigiri's was not right. Sliders were pretty good. Better than what I expected of the sushi. Wish the sushi was better than the sliders.
74,Ku, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A welcoming place with good sushi however the waiting staff were run off their feet, 7pm on a Monday too. We waited over half an hour just for drinks and food coming out was equally slow. Waiting staff apologised but it was slightly dissapointing."
75,Ku, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We ordered sashimi, flamed salmon nigiri and rib eye steak. From all of those only steak was something good. Sushi was very average and Chef special wasn’t very “special” (just basic roll with tempura, avocado and cucumber). …"
76,Ku, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Ku Kitchen is one of the better sushi places in town. They bring you a nice and refreshing mix of sushi that is not so standard as most of the other places. You will probably spend the same amount of money as you would spent on an …
77,Ku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They serve real good Japanese food here, it isn't the middle of the road type of all-you-can-eat restaurant that is so popular nowadays. Cosy interior and excellent and friendly staff. Good selection of Japanese whiskeys too!"
78,Ku, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was incredible.  It was a bit unconventional but surprisingly delicious.  I highly recommend the grilled avocado!

92,Ku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing japanese food. Delicious sushi, friendly service and great cocktails."
93,Ku, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Much better food this time than visit last year. Bar staff overall good. Food is tasty. Searing can be tight, reservation is recommended. One pet peeve is people bringing small children into the bar seating at night and letting them run around and squeal."
94,Ku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved the food! The service is great as well. It is not your average sushi bar, it is classy and differentiated."
95,Ku, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent food and very fresh sushi. The service was not the best, but I will go again to see if there is some improvement!"

97,Ku, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was fantastic - especially for Dutch standards. The food was just OK. The sushi we had was very salty, and the KFC chicken took so long to come out that we ended up leaving before it ever came out."
98,Ku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing authentic japanese food! It was crazy busy when we were there but still managed to get us a table no problems. Amazing service too! Always a smile 😊 thank you!!
99,Ku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best sushi in Amsterdam! Better book in advance... don’t know if it’s still on the Menu, but if you’re a brave one, go for the Maki Roulette. One random maki is filled with a lot of wasabi... if you happen to find it (poor you) they will bring you a shot of sake! 🔥"
100,Ku, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Delicious and very good service. Only the atmosphere was very dark and no possibility to sit outside.

Great Japanese restaurant with steady quality since it opened. Very tasty food and great cocktails. Service could be better (at times)."
105,Ku, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Love it here. Quality Japanese food and reasonably priced. The beef burger is quite good although it's not your typical Japenese dish. Always finish off with the creme brulee.
106,Ku, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Ku kitchen is a nice and vibrant place. Food is very good and it is more of a tapas place. I would make some changes on the ventilation as we were selling like grilled food after.

108,Ku, 1 star ,3 years ago,"on good Friday, one sign on the door saying that they open at 5:00 with red pen, then we go there at 5, one guy working there told us the kitchen open at 5:30，we ask kindly to wait inside, at least have a drink. They don’t allow us to go …"
109,Ku, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We went in the large group. They were very annonyed with preparing food for large group, I don't know why though. The food overall was medicore. My group really didn't liked the sushi or the grills. I thought it was alright."
110,Ku, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff but: incredible taste of food. Cocktails are really nice, atmosphere is cosy, and the shef's specials is to die for. Ask for Hiro and he knows what and how to serve. With joy."

The special burger was over density but again good.
Service was nice but we waited too long for the food.."
