3,Cafe Sport, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Delicious, quaint restaurant. A bit pricey for lunch but flavor, presence, waitress and establishment was very nice! Shrimp dish with chicken delish!!!!"
4,Cafe Sport, 1 star ,6 months ago,The wait staff are rude. This restaurant is on restaurant.com but I was rudely informed they don‚Äôt accept restaurant.com coupons. The food is just fair. It used to be better and more plentuful

10,Cafe Sport, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When visiting here you must try the red sangria. It's strong, yet refreshing, and you can taste the fruits. I always come with the mindset set of trying something else, but I can't seem to get enough of their red sangria. ‚Ä¶"

12,Cafe Sport, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Place is cozy with nice selection of foods.  My friend and i both ordered linguini with garlic shrimp.   Everything was prepared well and service was impeccable but sauce was a bit watery and not enough garlic in dish.   It was still good but had better elsewhere.  Portions were large.

14,Cafe Sport, 1 star ,a year ago,I wouldn't  go back to this place ever again.  Service was terrible  food wasn't good. Shrimp and scallops was very small.
