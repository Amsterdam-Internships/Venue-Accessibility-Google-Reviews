0,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,4 months ago,I think this is restaurant is such a gem. It's hidden in plain site at central station. It's a very big restaurant but with such character with the traditional decor. We saw so many cute older couples having lunch here. And rhe price is very reasonable for Amsterdam.
1,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great staff, food is great, prices above average, but the taste makes that ok, so enjoy the food there"
2,Eersteklas Restaurant, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Cool place with kind staff but the meat (carpaccio and beefsteak) here is very tasteless and dry. It literally had no taste. My partner had fish and he enjoyed the fish. ‚Ä¶
3,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Bought the 3 course meal through Get Your Guide.
Worth every penny.
The Smoked Salmon Salad was delicious. The flavors blended beautifully. ‚Ä¶"
4,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very nice aristocratic interior and delicious main courses and desserts. Also cool view on trains or on the city improves the impression. Very good
5,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"It's a bit hard to find if your not coming in off the train platform. But the food was excellent, the decor was lovely. Just beware of the Finnish stew! The pot they send out holds a deceptively large amount, definitely a dish to share."
6,Eersteklas Restaurant, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,"Worst waiter I‚Äôve had in Amsterdam, no smile, rude,.. the parrot would have done a better job. ‚Ä¶"
7,Eersteklas Restaurant, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Beautiful place. Horrible service and food. The waiter had the charisma of a wet sock. We booked a 4 course meal but got given the regular menu. Which is, whatever I guess. ‚Ä¶"
8,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a good place to have some beer while waiting for your train. There is hardly any warm place to sit and nibble inside the Amsterdam Centraal Station once you check in. So, this restaurant is probably your only choice. It has a great ‚Ä¶"

10,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It is a lovely place to relax if you have some time before or after a train journey. We tried angus and chicken burgers; both of them were good. The prices are a little bit higher compared to the rest of Amsterdam; but the tastes are much ‚Ä¶
11,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"In the wonderful station building a cafe with real atmosphere, in our last day unfortunately the parrot was at the doctor, usually the white parrot is an important part of the environment. Perfect coffee, good service and very tasty food."

21,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This restaurant was well hidden and is a treasure. The decor is definitely a Victorian period setting. I loved it.

The service was also of a very high standard."

34,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,2 years ago,While the name and interior of this place still reflects the grandeur of old all resemblance of actual first class treatment ends there. It's not uncommon to have to wait for 30 minutes to order your first drink while the staff is chatting ‚Ä¶
35,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Good food, great atmosphere! Friendly staff"
36,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A beautiful bar/restaurant. Rather pricey but given the location and atmosphere quite reasonable. Beer was 5 Euro. Dinners range into the 30's. Snacks from 3 to 18.  Causal seating in the bar. Finding it can be a challenge. There is 1 ‚Ä¶
37,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I have been her twice; the overall style is retro and the location is fabulous. The waiters are eager to please and although I have placed a couple of the harder orders (few places can get a DOM coffee just right) I have no complaints ‚Ä¶
38,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food pricey but good. Not a very attentive service or friendly atmosphere. Beautiful place, like going back in time. Only serve milk with coffee, no soya or oat milk options. Make sure you drink wine with your meal if you like to have water as well!"
39,Eersteklas Restaurant, 1 star ,3 years ago,"After we placed our order a long time had passed and we hadn‚Äôt had anyone come to check on our table. After multiple attempts we finally get someone over to check on our order, only to find out that our waiter had gone home and told nobody. ‚Ä¶"
40,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I was staying in Haarlem and I would take the train to Amsterdam. After a couple days touring I remember seeing out of the corner of my eye a beautiful restaurant, old and grand, in the train station.  My daughter who was traveling with me ‚Ä¶"
41,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So much charm and style in one place! A bit pricy but the ambiance is worth it.
42,Eersteklas Restaurant, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Over rated. The ribs came hardly warm, the seabass was decent / good, and they refused to serve us water unless we bought a bottle. Overall for the price not worth it unless your really hungry and want to eat while waiting for your train."
43,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is always a pleasure to visit this 'hidden' treasure. I've been coming here for as long as I can remember. Courteous, friendly service. Good coffee. Some the best pastries I've tasted anywhere. All that, plus the wonderful atmosphere of this former waiting room (dating back to 1881) with grand Art Nouveau decor."

46,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An undiscovered gem. Beautifully restored in authentic 19th Century style. Go for the ambience: high ceilings, lovely panelling, art deco light fittings. Even the table staff are uniformed in traditional style. ‚Ä¶"
47,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've had em all. Caesar salad is what I order, and I came here to try theirs. It was a feast! I got mine with gerookte zalm and it was the best I've ever had. Lovely interior, what a pleasant break from De Wallen ;) ‚Ä¶"
48,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"I've been to Grand Caf√©-Restaurant 1e klas several times and enjoyed it. The food was nice, the drinks were good. The staff is friendly and helpful.

49,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Food not bad, amthosper old Dutch style"
50,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very upmarket restaurant at the Amsterdam Central Station, great menu choices, excellent wine etc and friendly helpful staff. Can be a little hard to find when station is busy, but well worth finding. Prices are  reasonable also."
51,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very convenient for the metro back to our hotel. Especially good with the Hello Amsterdam discount voucher from the magazine in our hotel room. Food is very good and service was attentive without being too much.
52,Eersteklas Restaurant, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Went there several times. The service is very normal, one time we got a glass with lipstick on it twice, another time we got a dirty spoon. The food is just okay. The interior is very old-style which is the adding point of this place. Limited vegetarian dishes."
53,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"From a cup of coffee to a full meal, the 1e klas is an old-fashioned train station cafe & restaurant definitely worth visiting if you are early to catch your train. I remember enjoying myself here so much that I let three trains go by until ‚Ä¶"
54,Eersteklas Restaurant, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The restaurant is very pretty. A little hard to find: keep in mind you have to check in at perron 1 and you can check out in the restaurant itself. The Dutch staff did not respond to questions. Food was very good. For me it's a place worth visiting only once.
55,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"We went there to have breakfast and where overwhelmed of the great room and the bar.
Also the waiters were really kind. Unfortunately coffee and food weren't as ‚Ä¶"
56,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"They do their best, could do better though. I did not have a meal, reading from previous reviews that they do not serve water unless you order wine is just criminal... not everyone is drinking wine. I will not therefore go back."
57,Eersteklas Restaurant, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I sat down at a table at platform side in the hallway that had empty glasses and a bottle on it. Made a choice what I wanted to drink.
Several serving staff walked by, no acknowledgement of my arrival from any of ‚Ä¶"
58,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great experience last night, good food, good service and super ambiance"
59,Eersteklas Restaurant, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Grand old fashioned restaurant in the Central Station. High ceilings and large number of tables including some in side rooms. Waiting staff good and efficient but the main course was disappointing on both occasions we visited; desserts were good.
60,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place. Always fresh coffee. Try Kaffee verkered. Which is actually a coffee with lot of milk. Some good cakes always available. Nice ambiente. One of the old traditional places of Amsterdam
61,Eersteklas Restaurant, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Best thing here is the white cockatoo on the bar, 2nd best is the decor!

Rude, unhelpful, what I call typically Dutch service. The all male waiters act ‚Ä¶"
62,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastisch. Great place, hidden gem, nice food, and a parrot - Elvis, such fun!! Don't make the mistake to tunr one entrance too early and happen into the starbucks. You need to walk to the end '1st klasse'"
63,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent example of early 20th century faded grandeur. Only had tea and apple tart but it was nicely presented and the service was, by Dutch standards, affable and attentive."
64,Eersteklas Restaurant, 1 star ,6 years ago,"TERRIBLE coffee! Didn't even finish mine. One waiter was OK, nothing special, the other was very unfriendly and looked like he'd rather be at home. Mistakes with easy orders and the waiters weren't attentive at all. Had to practically wave a flare in their face to order something."
65,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place with a real old school vibe to it, definitely the place to go if you are waiting for a train at Amsterdam central. ‚Ä¶"
66,Eersteklas Restaurant, 3 stars ,3 years ago,My husband sent his steak back twice! He's never done that before third time lucky. The dinning room was closed so we ate in the cafe. Not quite the same experience.
67,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"To summarize, this restaurant has no right to call itself ‚Äò1st class‚Äô. Below I‚Äôll explain why. ‚Ä¶"
68,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Brilliant location at the platform where trains operated by German Rail are delayed. It adopted a French cliche in appearance and - unfortunately - rudeness and unfriendliness of staff. Whether I‚Äôm there in suit for business or in jeans ‚Ä¶
69,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place it's beautiful. All the details kept to perfection from back in the day. And they have a cacat√∫a on-site.
I just ordered a coffee before taking my train back to my country. Good service"
70,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Sky high prices for a place that had scaffolding everywhere. Check the menu prices before you make a visit. Great location (the old waiting room), but the quality of refurbishment left much to be desired."

72,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice venue, got 50% off for booking online reservation through trip adviser but service wasn't great and food could have been better. Rib eye steak very fatty and ordered desert but was brought the wrong one and no offer to exchange it."
73,Eersteklas Restaurant, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good food but service not great; hard to get waiters attention and bit annoyed when you ask for small adjustments. Overall nice atmosphere.
74,Eersteklas Restaurant, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice bar/restaurant in a historic part of the railway station. Targeted at tourists/travellers they offer nothing really special,  it's just a nice place to be. And the resident parrot on the bar can be quite entertaining at times üòÇ"
75,Eersteklas Restaurant, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic Location. Very nice for Breakfast, Lunch, Tea or even dinner.
The Menu has a wide range.
A bit expensive but you also pay for ambiance."

80,Eersteklas Restaurant, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great atmosphere and very professional service. Not just a nice place to go while waiting for a train. Well worth heading onto the platform just to eat.

92,Eersteklas Restaurant, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Meat was over cooked and service was below par. The overall atmosphere was okay but the food was not worth it.
