5,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Delicious and friendly place. The Box Sociaal guys prepare various tasty egg dishes and perfect burgers. Also they can advise you well about the drinks. Very good value for the money.

7,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Awesome owners, waiters, nice affordable and tasty food. Possibilitu to choose veggie, meat or fish for dinner. For lunch is brunch so the menu is different, I wish they would have some dinner plates also for lunch. Environment is cozy, ‚Ä¶"
8,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Delicious brunch, for a very reasonable price. Think about reserving, because they're quite booked. Even with a reservation, you might end up waiting 10min outside, but the waiters are nice enough to offer the drinks if so."

20,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,4 months ago,10/10 would recommend. Great service. Great taste. Please book in advance; super easy to do via their website.

24,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Always greeted with warmth and welcoming smiles here. Wonderful original roasted coffee from Friedhats. A salivating-making menu that satisfies carnivores and vegans alike. Just a really cool place- cool people, relaxed vibe, focus on yumminess. Thank you"
25,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Box social‚Äôs buttermilk burger & Bloody Mary can dust the cobwebs off the DUSTIEST of hangovers. Simply outstanding. Bravo
26,Box Sociaal, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Honestly somewhat mid, we came for dinner and had the fried chiken sandwich with fries. Chicken was dry and over fried, the rest of the sandwich was good. Fries mid, service mid. Had high hopes, hopefully we were just unlucky"

28,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Veg'o sandwhich is probably one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had. Eggs benny are also great, very interesting combination with the sauerkraut."
29,Box Sociaal, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"One dish was 2 stars (eggs benedict) and one was 4 stars (Korean pancakes). Combined with service that struggled to keep up, the overall experience was 2 stars but with potential to be more. ‚Ä¶"
30,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Easy way to reserve a table, great food and delicious drinks mixed with lovely staff and the background of some aussie accents - for me this might be the best place to get brunch in Amsterdam since it's as close as possible to perfect."
31,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicious food and they also have a lot of vegetarian options. A good place for breakfast or brunch, the volume is pretty big you will be full. But there are always a lot of people around, might be a bit noisy."
32,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly service, yummy breakfast options and really good coffee (long black, flat white, cappuccino no probs!). Veg options too. Nice open space inside and a relaxed crew. Will have to return to try the rest of the menu!!"
33,Box Sociaal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was a bit of a trek out of the centre to get here, but we had bikes so didnt take too long. Its right near the zoo so you could head over there at the same time. ‚Ä¶"
34,Box Sociaal, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"This place has had a consistently friendly service and good food with great coffee. Unfortunately it's now ruined by really terrible value for money. Which is a shame, as I liked this place. However the last three times I've been, I've had ‚Ä¶"

42,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was very delicious and the staff was super friendly and helpful. Also, when the waiting time for the pancakes was too long, they offered me to change my choice and also a free drink. How thoughtful! Will come back another time to try out the pancakes!!"
43,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,a year ago,Another great takeaway meal from Box Sociaal. They are constantly adapting to the changing landscape of horeca during this pandemic and they are rocking it. Tip: order takeaway/delivery directly from their website instead of a food delivery app so they profit the most during this difficult time.
44,Box Sociaal, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great coffee. You can get free refill of filter coffee in the morning.  Shakshuka is fine but bread for it is very oily. There are some seats outside and inside. Service is nice.
45,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I used to order their delicious burgers during covid lockdown times but unfortunately they changed up there menu and don't deliver anymore. Curious as I was to see why they did this I went there to grab a bite and the reason was to get back ‚Ä¶
46,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Definitely one of the best in town and a must try in Amsterdam! Came here for brunch as it was highly recommended by locals for the delicious food. Ingredients were freshly sourced and everything on the menu was beyond amazing. Best coffee ‚Ä¶
47,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Phenomenal brunch restaurant! Really chilled vibe, really friendly on the ball service. Had the eggs Benedict pimped up with extras and a Negroni - both perfectly executed!"

49,Box Sociaal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A casual, young eatery with international, food and some Australian specials. We went for the Albert Heijn promotion and chose this place because of the a-la-carte choice instead of a pre-set menu, usually served for promotional purposes. The food was nice, well prepared, arrived on time and tasted freshly made. Service is friendly"
50,Box Sociaal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place to visit if you are in the area and looking for brunch. Coffee was 5 stars...almost as good as what you would find in Melbourne, Australia. The brunch was ok. Wasn't blown away but wasn't disappointed either. Would recommend the ‚Ä¶"
51,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food tasted really good and the chai latte was yummy as well. I had the crab croissant meal, very unusual and interesting dish but all flavours worked great together! My partner had the shakshuka with add ons which was very appreciated too."
52,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Recently opened up but an instant classic. We went here for lunch (they also have a separate dinner menu) and really liked it. I had a burger which was really nicely done and super juicy. Would recommend stopping by if you're visiting Artis or even in your lunch break at the nearby University.
53,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very cool vibes, delicious food and tasty craft beer. Slightly expensive but you get what you pay for. Friendly cool staff"

55,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Honestly love this place, we are here every week. Their service is second to none. Very friendly. And to boot: they are open every day even public holidays. Food here is delicious, recent menu update has some new classics like the Korean chicken burger. Get yourself a Bloody Mary, even off the booze the virgin version is delicious."
56,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place was great, the food was good, service was good, decor was nice, I got the Shak Attack that was amazing (shakshuka), my husband got an open sandwich with avacado,  poached eggs, pepper, and tomatoes. For PB&J lovers they have a ‚Ä¶"

58,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing cafe. This was my first stop in Amsterdam and it set the mood for my whole stay. Really great tea, juice, beer, and general drink selection.

72,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I was walking with my friend to a restaurant and it stopped to make dinner service so we wandered around and spotted Box Sociaal. We decided to try it.

79,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and great menu.  Who would of thought an Aussie Bondi influenced eatery would be thriving in East of Amsterdam.   The menu was great and the food superb.  The burger I had was fantastic but there are so many more interesting options.

84,Box Sociaal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Located at a street corner with a nice view of the street. Ordered a Shak Attack but sadly the toasts were a bit overdone.. the shakshuka is also a bit too salty. Overall it didn‚Äôt look as good as other photos in the review.

I love all the items the menu."
92,Box Sociaal, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waiter forget about my order, and than, about 30 minutes, came to me and ask ‚Äúdo you want something?‚Äù. French fries and burger were too oily and greasy. The cocktail was too diluted, so I didn‚Äôt feel the true taste of this drink."

96,Box Sociaal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The lava cake (first thing on the dessert list in the menu) is heavenly good. The actual cake was really fluffy and the chocolate with caramel was delicious. The space is a bit crowded and it got loud, but this cake is worth it!"
