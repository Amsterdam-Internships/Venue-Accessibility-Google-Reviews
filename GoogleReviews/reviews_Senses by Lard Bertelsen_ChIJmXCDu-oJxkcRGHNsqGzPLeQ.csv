1,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Young, friendly, ambitious crew, delivering a well balanced and delicious tasting menu. The wine package was well put together, multiplying the experience.
Especially finding a white wine that could handle the beetroot in such good way, have to be mentioned. Here are some pics from a great evening, money well spent."
2,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Each dish was amazing. Amazing blend of different tastes. Super creative! We really felt spoiled throughout the night. Wine pairing was amazing.

Everything was really good but not really special for us and didn’t blow us away. …"
5,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,8 months ago,We had a very special experience at Senses. The service was great and the food was so rich in flavors. The brioche they serve at the beginning must have been some of the best I tried ever. The amuses were super delightful and everything seemed well thought out.
6,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,a month ago,"A great fine dining experience with very friendly service and amazing wood.

11,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute place with great service and great food. There were 3 amuse which I think is quite a lot consider we ordered 4 cause menu. The eel was very tasty, loved it. I'm not a big fan of venison but their venison is the best I tasted so far. They have some interesting wine choices too, give them a try."
12,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"First, make a reservation! The restaurant is quite small and it seemed like the only guests who ate here had a reservation in advance. You can choose between 4 to 7 courses, and each course is a secret until it’s served to you. Either …"

If you are not a good drinker, you can opt for half portion. Their wine cellar is located underground with glass ceiling where you can look into it. Foods are delicious and services are good"
16,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,An excellent restaurant with surprising flavour combinations and stunning presentations. We kicked off the meal with 3 amuses and the option of a glass of champagne. I thought that the price of the glass of bubbly (€17) was pretty steep but …
17,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow. Truly awesome experience. Amazing food with new flavors I have never tasted. Not every course was kind blowing but most were. This was a great experience with great food and amazing service. If you are used to these types of meals (think Le Bernadin in NYC), this is close, at a fraction of the price."
18,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great experience. We had the six course tasting menu without wine pairing. The only reason we didn’t go for the max 7 course one was that one of us was allergic to shellfish and crustaceans and they couldn’t work around that for the seventh …
19,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What a foodie experience we had here! We went for the three course lunch tasting menu, with coffee and wine. First, we were brought an eel amuse bouche that was divine - so light and delicious. Then, we had a fish starter, an amazingly …"
20,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fantastic food and service. Highly recommended. They ask you about your allergies and dietary restrictions and then they just send out incredible dishes. I went with the 5 course menu. It was fantastic. I had 5 courses plus multiple …
21,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had the 5 course tasting menu and it was really enjoyable. The service was casual and not too over the top. Most dishes were delightful. Didn’t really enjoy the duck course as it looked like a dessert but tasted savoury, definitely messes …"

29,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This was absolutely brilliant! We were just strolling along the streets looking for something to eat and ran into Senses by coincidence. It was an amazing experience. If you are familiar with ‘Noma’ from Denmark, they are really close to …"
30,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,4 years ago,So happy we went here! It was our last night in Amsterdam and it was well spent. We had the 7 course set menu.

You have to go here if you are in Amsterdam.. no need to second guess :)

32,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Great presentation and service. We had a 2 and 3 courses menu for lunch. The main dish is chicken, was delicious but not as impressive as the first course. But I would like to try the dinner menu next time."

49,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,a year ago,It was absolutely incredible. 100% recommended. Rudy and his team treated us like kings and we really had a great time. I brought my gf for her birthday and it was a 3 Michelin starred level restaurant. The wine pausing was excellent and surprising and the food was outstanding. Congrats guys!
50,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The dishes were all a remarkable mix of flavors, with subtle combinations that were a delight. The service was excellent. I drink a lot of water and can usually judge the service of a restaurant by how good a job they do keeping my glass full. It never went empty here. All in all, a delightful visit."
51,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful experience! We enjoyed our anniversary dinner at Restaurant Senses tonight. The service was amazing and the food was a sensation. We would highly recommend 7 courses with wine pairings to truly experience as the chef intends. …

56,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the 5 courses tasting menu pared with wine. Probably the best dining experience we had in Amsterdam.

57,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was good but be sure to tell them if there was anything you would not want to have. For me that was pork, raw food and wine."
58,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We had the 5 course meal without wine which was plenty. The courses were tasty and imaginative although we didn't think much of the sweetbread course that didn't seem to go with anything else. Service trotted along at a decent pace and the prices seemed very reasonable. A very pleasant night out.

60,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food. Went for the seven course meal with wine pairing and we did not regret.    Well balanced flavours and very good quality ingredients, a lot of them locally. Did get many dishes we never had before, like the main course made …"

63,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Wonderful experience.  I had the six course ""surprise"" tasting menu, my wife had the four course, both with wine pairings.  Excellent, creative food in a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere.  Three and a half hours, and totally worth it."
64,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Tiny, minuscule portions for a hefty price. Paid 110 euros for a three course lunch for two people. Really not impressed by the Barbie sized dishes and strange/bland flavors. Friendly server, although we had no idea what she was saying most of the time because of her thick accent."

66,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Lovely food and lovely atmosphere. We went for the 3 course surprise menu and it was definitely surprising in a good way. Each item shows a lot of creativity in blending flavors from various ingredients and phenomenal attention to detail in its presentation.
67,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It's one of those fancy places where service is great and the wine always flows! Had a 4 course meal with only 2 courses that were worth calling out.the wine they pair is amazing .But for the price you pay you could have two very good meals elsewhere in the city.I kind of enjoyed the experience but I don't see myself going back.
68,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,a year ago,We stopped for drinks on the way back to cruise ship. We were served promptly but servers were surprisingly barely cordial. Our drinks were good.

70,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic service and stunningly presented food.  We had never done a multi-course, surprise menu and it was a pleasant experience.  Presentation A+, Service A+,  Flavours B+.  Overall for our family it was enjoyable but not necessarily repeatable."
71,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A place of its kind. Nice and exquisit. Central location and expensive.
We have been in many fine dining. Food is nicely presented but lacks of taste and variety... Expect variety of diffrent dishes. Service with a smile but at the …"

Looking forward to returning there and living the experience again! A must for food taste seekers!
79,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We tried the 4 course fixed menu lunch and we loved everything about it. The food and the wine were exquisite and our maître d was lovely and attentionate. We already have made a new reservation to come back!
80,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Worthy of a Michelin star. The wine parring option is a must as the wine are very good. The food is creative and titilates all the senses with layers of complex savours. A real degustation menu. Expect to endulge a good 3 hours in this experience.
81,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"They don't have a la carte, only menu sets. All surprise menus. You also get some small bites in between the courses and they are all delicious! For the price you pay, it is more than worth it if you go for ""taste""."

89,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A fantastic experience with some ""trompe l'oeil"" e.g. chocolate rocks. 1st meal excellent salmon, main course perfectly sauce and meat, dessert with unexpected combination. Sure we will come back!!"
90,Senses by Lard Bertelsen, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Made a reservation through IENS website. Despite confirmation there was no table available in the restaurant. Mistakes happen, but the way it was dealt with by the restaurant was very poor; as if their fault is suddenly the customer's mistake. Can not judge the food but will never go back due to the mentality of the management."
