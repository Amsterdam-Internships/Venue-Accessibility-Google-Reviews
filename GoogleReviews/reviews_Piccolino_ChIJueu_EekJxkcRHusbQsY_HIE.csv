0,Piccolino, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Bread & dips was so good!! I visit this place every time I‚Äôm in amsterdam. I love the ambiance, the food and the antipasti. The staff is very friendly and kind. Once we had such short time but they managed to serve the food so fast so we catched our bus in time. A place full of good memories for me. Thank you!"
1,Piccolino, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Second time here this past week! Tried more than a few dishes. Everything was incredible! Try the pear and gorgonzola pasta and the truffle ravioli!! Can‚Äôt forget the Lambrusco! But beyond all the food the service was top notch. Thanks for everything. I will be back!!
2,Piccolino, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Friendly service and fantastic food. It's a must come restuarant if you're the around here.
3,Piccolino, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I don't know where to start to praise this restaurant in the heart of Leidssplein area. One should never have a dilemma of what to order from the menu as everything is scrumptiously delicious. Not to mention the service and the friendliness of the place. I will be back!
4,Piccolino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place was good :) the food was excellente even if I didn't took pictures and I also loved the beer üç∫ it was well located and I was able to sit were there were less people ; I like it when you can talk without trouble to the person ‚Ä¶

6,Piccolino, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Good food with great host.
7,Piccolino, 1 star ,5 months ago,"My girlfriend got extremely sick and had to vomit countless times after eating there.
Service was alright, my pizza was ok but the Pasta gave her a food poisioning."
8,Piccolino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very good Italian food. Ravioli were super delicious and prices were also incredibly good. Excellent value for money. Served us freshly squeezed juice. Very recommended.
9,Piccolino, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Huuuge portions. Great steak. Prolly would be nice to have more beers from tap but it's Italian place with winecard full of wines. Cozy atmosphere, not loud relaxing music. A little bit cold to see near window. Worth to visit to eat after whole day walking"
10,Piccolino, 5 stars ,a week ago,Amazing food with extremely big portions and delicious dishes
11,Piccolino, 5 stars ,6 months ago,A nice restaurant with cozy interior. The staff was incredibly nice and had an excellent service. The food was very tasty for a good affordable price! Definitely returning back as soon as possible

14,Piccolino, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The salad, pasta and pizza are delicious in this restaurant as well as the service"
15,Piccolino, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,Restaurant with space but the pizzas are not great.  The dough is not homemade it is frozen dough
16,Piccolino, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is what you get for 5 euros. Somehow they call it ravioli but it was more like a lasagna. Delicious! Add a glass of homemade wine or lambrusco and enjoy people watching.
17,Piccolino, 1 star ,6 months ago,"The food was inedible. The pizza was hard as rock, didn't have much taste. I'll never go back again, the people working there were really rude."
18,Piccolino, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Loved the family owned place!! Owner served us and was fantastic. Great customer service, great food, great homemade tiramisu! Would highly recommend this."

Would highly recommend for food and or drinks!"
23,Piccolino, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Best pizza in Amsterdam !! Good atmosphere and good service !!!!
24,Piccolino, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Rude waiter so we were cautious at first but the food was a decent quality in the end and we enjoyed it. Medium sized portions.
Edited: service was awful and they added a whole ‚Ç¨6 to our meal out of nowhere. ‚Ä¶"
25,Piccolino, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Oh how good!!!

27,Piccolino, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Could seat a large party of 10 with no reservations....which should have been our first clue that we weren‚Äôt in for a great experience. The bread, herbed butter, and olives served before the meal was the highlight and went downhill from ‚Ä¶"
28,Piccolino, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Cheap prices. Incredibly friendly staff (even offered us coffee or tea on the house). But the two finger-sized Cannelloni weren‚Äôt much to beg for and the Caprese Salad wasn‚Äôt exactly a work of art. ‚Ä¶
29,Piccolino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizza / pasta for ‚Ç¨5 is a great price! Very nice for the quality. Had the mushroom ravioli, basic but tasty, especially on a budget. Staff and atmosphere were nice, quick service too. Not the most exceptional food but for what we paid it was very nice!"
30,Piccolino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy place. Went with a couple friends, we did have to wait a little bit to be seated, it was a busy day. Got a nice window seat and ate good food. The stairs up (and down) towards the toilet might be a bit scary if you've had a few glasses of wine/beer/any other alcoholic beverage."
31,Piccolino, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Good and cheap food. Pizza from 5 euro
32,Piccolino, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to have Italian food. Pizza was delicious and so was Pasta. Prices are also reasonable.
Lots of vegetarian options available. ‚Ä¶"
33,Piccolino, 3 stars ,a year ago,The whole sphere and location wasn‚Äòt really appealing but the food and service is good. It‚Äòs more of a tourist-place than a place where you‚Äòd genuinely wanted to eat at.
34,Piccolino, 1 star ,7 months ago,"let's just say it's a place I wouldn't go back to. education and courtesy towards the customer left at home. let's not talk about food, I don't want to remember this experience"
35,Piccolino, 1 star ,2 years ago,Found hair in our food and the waiter tried to convince me it was from my jumper ... Quite difficult to get your 'jumper hair' inside the penne. Very overpriced for a very basic meal. Would not to again
36,Piccolino, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Not very good, it's a normal tourist restaurant."
37,Piccolino, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great food, portions are just the right size! The atmosphere is very nice and we had a wonderful time! Prices are very reasonable as well."
38,Piccolino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice food, very nice people. Nice setting. Close to many hotels. Might go back again on this trip. Traditional Italian food and healthy salads. There is a lot to like about this restaurant."
39,Piccolino, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Correct restaurant, not too upscale."
40,Piccolino, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice pizza.  On the day I visited the service was slow. It took nearly an hour to get a 'quick' pizza.  Wasn't a problem for me though.
41,Piccolino, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We ordered - pizza which was good, the other plates were not eatable- the tenderloin steak was made from frost meat , it came with a salad that the chef put too much vinegar on it, the pasta bolulonege was without meat.. the sause was ‚Ä¶"
42,Piccolino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"After a busy day exploring the city, we were so happy to find this gem!
Everything we ordered here was very tasty and their portions are big...would highly recommend their calzone and finish your meal with a fresh juicy tiramisu! Yummm"
43,Piccolino, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Decent food for an average price in a fairly small restaurant. We were in a group of 12, we were put on 2 tables of 6 which were not together, which was fine. Friendly service."
44,Piccolino, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Typical tourist fare. I'm sure the pizzas will be fine, but the risotto and cannelloni were very below par. Giving two stars though for location and friendly staff"
45,Piccolino, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Reasonably priced food that was extremely tasty. The pizza was light and crunchy and the carbonara was one of the best I've tasted. Finishing off with profiteroles was the icing on  the cake. Grazie mille
46,Piccolino, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The service is very good and the pizza is awsome, great price great quality!!!! Im writing this as i just finished the meal. We had a little situation with the seating, but they made up with tiramisu (wich was delish!!!!) and cappuchino! Thank you!!!!! We'll be back!"
47,Piccolino, 1 star ,11 months ago,"The lasagna looks like Shrek in his swamp, it's snorkeling in sauce. Pasta sauce leaves a nice lake of red water, probably what the Egyptians saw after the first Plague sent by God. Everything is tasteless, had to put salt on my pizza. The ‚Ä¶"

49,Piccolino, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The Focaccia appetiser was decent, but everything else was a little expensive for the quality. As is to be expected, the non-alcoholic drink prices were very high. The pasta was OK."
50,Piccolino, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great Pasta
51,Piccolino, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cosy with a great music playlist, cheap and tasty Italian food. I put only 3 stars because the 2 evenings I came, the staff wasn't smiling and not very friendly (but polite)."
