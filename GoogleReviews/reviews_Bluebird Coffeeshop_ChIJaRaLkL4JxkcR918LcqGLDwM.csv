2,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"So far I'd say this is my favorite coffeeshop I've visited here in Amsterdam. The staff were lovely, the atmosphere was perfect, the prices and quality of the flower was great, and I even liked the music (which has been a rare experience ‚Ä¶"
3,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"At this place I tried the ""Volcano Vaporizer"" for the first time. An interesting experience. ‚Ä¶"
4,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Absolutely love this place, I visit every year, the staff are wonderful and don't care for employing people that aren't friendly and caring. It's always a pleasure, I'd love for them to have more space for more people by purchasing a second ‚Ä¶"
5,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Lovely coffeeshop with lots of inside space to enjoy a stay. The staff was always friendly and helped with everything that was needed (papes, filters, tobacco substitution). Important to note that smoking with tobacco inside is prohibited ‚Ä¶"

7,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favourites. Super friendly staff, great music, fair prices and an extensive selection. They also have an area dedicated to tobacco which is super handy. They dont have a silly ""have to buy a drink too"" policy that alot of coffeeshops have. Couldn't ask for more. Theres also a very nice view on the top floor"
8,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful place for coffee and great view.

11,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The bluebird was recommended by many friends. Unfortunately it was rather a bitter disappointment. I ate 1.5 space muffins and it didn't have any effect. My friend experienced the same the other day. Nevertheless, you can buy other stuff there and it's a location with culture and character."
12,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Was off the beaten track,  more of a chilled vibe..  Lovely cappuccinos, lovely weed, especially the ''blue cookie''...
Friendly staff, not moody like alot of other cafes in the more frequently used areas (understandably).."
13,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Their muffins are for rather 4 than 2 people, take care
But their pre roll is amazing for ‚Ç¨4!"
14,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 months ago,This Coffeeshop is amazing.  We feel at home with our friends.  Comfortable on rainy days!
15,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The coffee beans that they use are off great quality.  The drinks were prepared properly and were a perfect temperature to enjoy. The staff was a little bit annoying and were very hard to read and understand.  This coffee shop is conveniently located close to the Rembrandt house.
16,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Friendly staff, really went the extra mile to help us out!"

24,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Highly recommend for first-timer! The staff here are very helpful. They will give you clear instructions of how much you should take the product. I had half of a space cake and 2 hours later it hit me so strong! Good experience and good feelings.
25,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We came with a tour group a couple of weeks back. One of the party experienced his first whitey in 30 years. The staff were awesome.

28,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, convenient location too. The guy that works behind the counter selling the weed is super helpful, the girl working the coffee section seemed pretty annoyed with everyone though. Great pre-rolled joints at a fair price, and the smoking room is really chill. Open windows help to air the place out. I would reccomend!"
29,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good weed and vibes here. Came here when I first landed and got me some good dank a coffee and met a couple friends ! ‚Ä¶
30,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice weed there. Pretty good deals too, you can get 4.2g of Super Skunk for 35‚Ç¨. Relatively big chill Area where you can roll up your joints. Tobacco use is no problem just don't let your cigs/tobacco laying around."
31,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I am not a smoker and this is one of the only coffee shop I can stay in without suffocating from the smoke. The real extra for me was that I got to enjoy Latin rhythms of Company Segundo. Finally some good music in a coffee.
32,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is great and the atmosphere is dope. The music is about as decent as it gets and the staff is friendly. Didn't get a chance to look at their weed menu,only got drinks there, which were fine.  Would give dice stars if the place ‚Ä¶"

35,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good weed at a good price. Smoking room was cosy in size but enough room to sit and drink comfortably. Free WiFi always a bonus. Drinks are a similar price to other herbal venues. We chose this place over most because of the friendly staff, seating availability, and unique atmosphere."
36,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The best darn 'Coffee' in Amsterdam served with drinks and snacks in a relaxing environment with good tunes.
37,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Lovely place. Really enjoyed the atmosphere of the cafe. The location had volcanos for anyone to use if they wanted to leave a 10 pound deposit. Really reasonable prices with a variety of strains offering good qualitys for price.
38,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great spot! Great coffee. Great weed at decent prices. Pleasant staff. Good music. Chill vibes. Hard to go wrong here! One of my favorite coffee shops.

Nice and various music all the time. ‚Ä¶"
45,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, knowledgeable staff. Great tea and hot chocolate. Its wasn't as busy as the other cafes around which suited us. Still has quality stuff. Hope to return in the future"
46,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 years ago,The man was extremely rude and unprofessional to my friends. It killed the vibes. He should honestly be fired. What a terrible way to run a business. Everything about the way he spoke to me and my friends should've been the complete opposite. Much better places to go. Waste of money. Weed wasn't that good. Will never return here.
47,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Rude staff, went a couple doors down where they were very nice."
48,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"Roadworks are hiding this coffeeshop at the moment and a bit off the beaten track so could be hard to come across.
It has a nice, light and airy atmosphere and some comfy lounge like chairs on ‚Ä¶"
49,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"The staff could be nicer (the bouncers can be a little weird, and maybe the waitress was having a bad day) but the general vibe is good. The main part is for smoking pure joints (which I would recommend if you want to taste a lot of ‚Ä¶"

51,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I‚Äôve been on the hunt for Gelato in Amsterdam since I have this strain grown at home (San Diego, CA). Went to almost 10 different cafes before I came across Bluebird and I should have started here all along.. they had Gelato! The priciest ‚Ä¶"
52,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice selection of products and reasonable prices. One of my favourites.
53,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,Asked a barista for descriptions of the types of tea and got straight attitude. She told me to google it and then not to play with the person making my drinks. Never had such rude service.
54,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, good service and a great price.  Bluebird is one of the oldest coffeeshops in Amsterdam. It serves high quality products and has wonderful service. It has a separate seating area for smokers with Tabacco, where you can sit and enjoy a drink or snack with friends. The rest of the place has seating for pure smokers."
55,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I got there and there was a chill vibe, very nice and helpful service and a room apart for smoking with tabacco, barely any smoke.
Sometimes it was busy but the line was gone within minutes, fast service ‚Ä¶"
56,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good stuff and staff, nice music, available a few Volcanos."
57,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I was very disappointed with this coffee shop, my first marijuana experience in Amsterdam and the tree was awful. Reggie Miller definitely lives there! Too many seeds and sticks not good at all, very wack  buds.  I wish I could give them a half star."
58,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really nice coffee shop, great selection of weed, good food (toasties mainly), nice smoking area, good service, and free WiFi too! Would recommend this place! They've also got a few bongs and a vaporizer for you to use."
59,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A bit cramped. Good vibe. Nice music. Awesome mint tea. Had a really good time there! Great highs! Good quality. Cannabis college recomended.
60,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Ok weed but great hasj
61,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great weed, selection, staff and atmosphere! It can be busy but a table frees up relatively fast if you're willing to wait a bit."
62,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Bluebird had a great run as one of the better shops in town, but we've not seen much of them lately. See some of our older reviews with a simple google search. The place looks largely the same as for the last 2 decades, a bit ""squatty"", ‚Ä¶"
63,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Located in a modern and Main Street, But have some distance with the Red Light District and tourist area, that‚Äôs what I like . Drink and weed is very nice. Friendly service."
64,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I'd 100% recommend this place and as a tourist was treated great. If you are going to partake, be warned, you have to make it back down the treacherous stairs. Partake at the bottom. I think I spent an hour too scared I was going to fall leaving. Other than that lol it's amazing."
65,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"That was the first coffeeshop in Amasterdam that I visited, and since then everytime when I am in the city I'll go there. Great place, kind of trippy (well, it should be!), nice crew and cosy inside. I really enjoy time spend there, even those curvy really steep stairs. That was so fun! I need to go back there ASAP!"
66,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This coffeeshop is for me one of the best in Amsterdam.

Especially the lounge on the first floor is very cozy and invites you to linger. ‚Ä¶"
67,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Probably one of the most famous coffee shops in Amsterdam. It was recommended to me by the guys from the Cannabis College as the best coffee shop close to the Red Light District (referring mostly to the fact, that you can trust their weed ‚Ä¶"
68,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This was one of my favourites for the lemon haze which is amazing! and the amnesia haze, the best I've ever smoked!
When I first walked in there where two blokes that reminded me of cheech and ‚Ä¶"
69,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Been going to the bluebird for over 20 years. Nice range of weed and drinks and snacks. It's not a big place and has a nice atmosphere. Well recommended.
70,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Weed quality was ok & staff seemed a little terse during our visit. I dont like coffee shops where the weed is either weighed or bagged out of sight. Always makes me edgy!!!
71,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,a year ago,Whenever I am in Amsterdam I always visit the Bluebird. For me it is an Amsterdam staple. Friendly staff and since the refurb it has a much crisp and cleaner feel to it. Will be back.
72,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Classic coffeeshop that is definitely worth visiting, plenty of seating as there is two floors aswell as outdoor seating, super friendly staff, who have bongs and other smoking accessories available"
73,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Delightful, brilliant service plus a lovely team that works there and good company not to mention how beautiful it is... It's a must see place why in Amsterdam even if you don't smoke, just go in the morning for thier fresh juice and ‚Ä¶"
74,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Very helpful and informative staff. However, it's not a nice place to chill like others have suggested. It's dark and feels seedy."
75,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great coffee shop, definitely one to visit. Always really friendly staff, loads of seating upstairs and downstairs, little outdoor seating area too great when the sun's out. Right near a few nice places to eat too."
76,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place for coffee and weeds.
You can even smoke outside with chairs and tables so you can enjoy your smoking outside with great Netherlands views."
77,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Smoking room is small and they don't wide selection of weed but the few they have are very good quality. Cozy and nice music but the wi-fi doesnt work :p
78,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favourite coffee shop in Dam! We kept coming back. Great vibe, not too expensive, loads of snacks and great space muffins"
79,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Was an amazing experience to have a joint while sipping a cappuccino and having a chat with the locals. The smoking room while cosy in size, had a fair amount of room compared to other coffeeshops."
80,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My fave, recent refit makes for more room in upstairs smokii g room. You can't go wrong with bluebirds it's a briliant coffeeshop and has been great every visit for 25years"
81,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"went to a variety of coffee shops over our 4 day break in the city and bluebird was one of the most memorable, friendly staff and interesting art work coating the walls, was quite disappointed to be told we were not allowed to take pictures.. but other than that really tranquil atmosphere."
82,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My first coffeeshop experience. I loved the vibe in here and met some cool people. Prices are reasonable. Rather cramped inside though, and they only accept cash payments."
83,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favourite coffee shop I visited whilst in Amsterdam! The art in there is incredibly mind blowing, the weed is exceptional and the presence of place is enlightening, sing on bluebirdd üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
84,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A very special place if you come here a another country. But it was ok. The prices are friendly.
85,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice place with 2 floors. Awesome spot at the bar where you can watch the flow. Good tea with cookies and honey.

91,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Been here multiple times and we all loved it! Other shops are too touristy and the products doesn't do the job either for the high prices...very friendly space, good prices and very good products..worth the walk even if it's a little off the centre."
92,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,Dont go there. Rude staff and dont leave you alone one minute with their rules. Dont smoke here...dont sit on this table..dont role tigarette here but they are a smoking coffee place. So annoying while in other coffee shops was so relaxing.
93,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 years ago,I Went to TEN coffee shops in three days; Bluebird had both amazing hash and weed. The experience was friendly and the people all around cool. This is NOT the atmosphere in all the weed coffee shops. Some shops make you buy drinks to sit ‚Ä¶
94,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Bluebird coffee shop wasn't the biggest of its kind. But apart from that i would still give it a 5 star,s, as the atmosphere is first class with great staff and a friendly experience to boot."
95,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderfully. Highly recommended. Very chill coffee, a lot of weed to choose from... The music was very good. Seemed like more locals come to this place"
96,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Unique atmosphere. Bonus room for tobacco smokers. Double bonus with volcanos for main area, triple bonus for beautiful art."
97,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great selection of ""coffee"" and very friendly bar staff. I went in after dark and the line was somewhat long but took no time at all. Will def stop here again on my next visit to Amsterdam."
98,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a laid-back, more 'independently' stylized coffeeshop. Nice open atmosphere already in early afternoon. Product quality up to high local standards."
99,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Their chocolate muffins are way too strong. They are too intense for inexperienced people/tourist. They should make that clear.
100,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, stash and vibe.  Has lots of volcanoes for vaping. Love BlueBird and will always go back."
101,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best coffee shop in Amsterdam I found so far really nice people and staff. sum awesome weed reasonable price

105,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"They sell my absolute favorite: Dr. Greenspoon. Try this and you won't be disappointed. They have a good selection and average prices. Alltough there is not too much space (as like in every cofeshop), I liked it a lot."

112,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 years ago,"What happened to the old psychedelic and cosy Blue bird ?! It looks cheap, plastic, and soulless üò±üò±üò± I‚Äôm mourning forever. Where did the beautiful and odd wall paintings go ? Such a waste."

118,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Slightly away from the main streets so a quieter chilled out atmosphere. Friendly and helpful staff with space for a few groups.
119,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good price and quality, friendly stuff. They even have vapes (volcano) which is not that common in Amsterdam!"
120,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic coffee shop. Great choice of hashish and Grass. With the added benefit of having an area for smoking tobbaco Doobies

123,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The only thing I think this place was missing would be a window to grab your buds from. But other then that I loved all the art on the walls and people that worked there.

125,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My first experience in Amsterdam 20 years ago, once  they're done with the refurb I'm sure another generation of heads will love it"
126,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 1 star ,3 years ago,Not for me. Place had a bad vibe and not cool. Plenty more cool coffee shops to be had. Walked in staff were rude and not your obvious coffee shop.
127,Bluebird Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"4.5 star. Very good place. Good weed, good coffee, good service. The only problem that is a bit small for this amount of people."
