1,Rainarai, 5 stars ,a month ago,"My fiancee and I dined at Rainarai for her birthday. The atmosphere was great, the staff extremely courteous, the food very tasty and beautifully presented.

30,Rainarai, 1 star ,a year ago,We ordered two menus and everything was a complete disappointment. My plate of vegetables was half hot half cold. The lamb was chewy and dry. The chicken was super dry. The chef was having a very bad day that day.
31,Rainarai, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Stopped for a quick drink to hide from the non-stop rain but fascinated by the menu, decided to order some food. Some interesting options that keep changing by the season, was pleasantly surprised. Do check it out and you won't be disappointed"
32,Rainarai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,First of all the decoration inside is beautiful! It felt like we were in a completely different world. The feeling inside is like a peaceful oasis with the music and dimmed lighting. The food is beautifully presented and very tasty. We had the mezze and the chef made us many beautiful dishes.
33,Rainarai, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Real oasis in a glorious spot.  Food was creative and full of flavour, texture and visual delight, to enjoy in a leafy glade."

35,Rainarai, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice place. I really liked the overall look and atmosphere. Rest room outside is not the best with winter rain. Food was good even if something a little bit too spicy (but I guess this is normal). Chicken was really well cooked and with amazing flavour. Service was extremely kind.
36,Rainarai, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is good, place is cozy however the service is not good and quite expensive for the quantity... was there with a group of 14 people, had only 2 bottles of wine and a few beers, the bill was 44‚Ç¨ per person. ‚Ä¶"
37,Rainarai, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is cozy and has really great food, but it's like the waiters don't know how being a waiter works. Service was sort of friendly but very slow, not assertive, and when we did manage to order they forgot about it instantly, or brought something else.  My advice: keep the cook, lose the waiters!"
38,Rainarai, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Went here on a Friday night. The service was a bit awkward. For example they claimed that someone else with the same name had taken my reservation and it took 15 minutes for them to take our drink orders. I also didn't like the music much, ‚Ä¶"

41,Rainarai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I like the food and the character of the chef üë©‚Äçüç≥ he dances talks to the guests and serves good Algerian food. This is very rare in individualistic and reserved Dutch society. Highly recommend to go and see it for yourself ! Very far away for me but worth the trip and the visit.

44,Rainarai, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, but quite slow, albeit friendly,  service."
45,Rainarai, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I wouldn‚Äôt go here if I was you. Weird experience in a beautiful building. Waiter was very friendly, but gave us no option about the food we ate and just said he‚Äôd bring us the food they make. Food was ok but not very tasty and at ‚Ç¨32 for food alone, and ‚Ç¨48 for food and a glass and a half of wine I felt pretty ripped off."
46,Rainarai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is an excellent venue, attentive and friendly service. Passionate about what they do. Comfortable and gezellig. I will be certain to recommend this place to family and friends as much as possible! ‚Ä¶"
47,Rainarai, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Friendly service, but the artichoke and ""roasted"" vegetable dish I ate tasted more steamed.  The side of mixed meat was a bit bland. The smaller shop in Prinsengracht has delicious food and is more for takeout.  I'll head back there next time üëç"
48,Rainarai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Rainarai is one of the best North African food I have ever eaten. I‚Äôm from Italy but I live in Amsterdam and I can tell that is not that easy to find such delicious food for such a good price! All the ingredients are fresh and the way they ‚Ä¶
49,Rainarai, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Eat it all!!!!! Great location! Very well kept bathrooms as well, if only a little dim on the lighting front"
50,Rainarai, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Service is slow but probably that‚Äôs because of the complex dishes they serve (slow cooked).
51,Rainarai, 5 stars ,a year ago,I was here with friends and we really loved the food and atmosphere. Also the staff was super friendly and chatted a bit with us. Would definitely recommend.
52,Rainarai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice food and nice environment, especially in summer outside! I like how the menu is always changing, and you cans and taste the passion of the chef!
Aanrader!"
53,Rainarai, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was ok, fish was not so well cooked. Waitress was nice and friendly, but one waitress for the whole restaurant was by far too less. We had to wait hours for our food. I will never go back there again."
54,Rainarai, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Food completely lacked any spices and salt. Chef was walking around the restaurant asking all kinds of questions to people while eating. While at my table, talking to some of my company: ""Vegetarian lady, why aren't you eating this?"" for ‚Ä¶"
55,Rainarai, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, ambience, music and a lovely waitress. But the guy in charge (manager?) greeted us with a sexist comment and called us ‚Äúchicks‚Äù. I don‚Äôt come to a restaurant and pay to be call a ‚Äúchick‚Äù. Super unprofessional of him and shows his view of women. Shame because the food and place are magical."
56,Rainarai, 4 stars ,7 years ago,Best food in two weeks of eating in greater Jordaan area. We had not made a reservation (who'd a thought?) so we did take away. Got three different meals of three items and shared. More than enough for 4 (we were 3 and groaning at the finish). Every item was wonderfully flavorful and perfectly cooked!
57,Rainarai, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice and cosy atmosphere (although quite cold inside). The food is an interesting fusion of Oriental quisine - healthy, mostly vegetarian, big portions, mid-range priced. The service is slow and not client-oriented."
58,Rainarai, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The staff was incredibly rude!
First the guy said that the place was open just for drinks, so we said that was ok and asked for a beer, then the guy said they were closed (at 4 pm, sure) ‚Ä¶"
59,Rainarai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great experience with great food. We didn't get a menu, but the chef decided everything for us, including the wine. Was well worth it."
60,Rainarai, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It's ok, food could be much better but atmosphere is nice"
61,Rainarai, 3 stars ,7 years ago,Great ambiance.. BUT the service was really slow! The mussels were overcooked. I was very disappointed as a friend of mine went and recommended it to me saying Rainarai was amazing. This time.. Not so much. I guess they can't handle a busy Friday evening.
62,Rainarai, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great place. I loved the north african atmosphere. Will go soon for food but i do recommend it already!
63,Rainarai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food, large portions. Service is quite poor unfortunately (long waits, forgetting orders and expect to open the bottle of wine yourself)"
64,Rainarai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful and cozy restaurant with delicious food. I am for ever in love with their chocolate covered figs. Looking forward to come back very soon.
65,Rainarai, 1 star ,3 years ago,We were greeted by a guy saying they only had drinks. Once ordered drinks the guy waived his hands Goodbye as if he didn't like us and wanted us to go. Not sure what's that about but it was extremely rude.
66,Rainarai, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We waited to be noticed for 25 minuted but it did not happen, one of the waiters was busy talking to pretty girls, others didnt care while the place was almost empty ( I can understand why). We left and the staff did not notice it either."
67,Rainarai, 4 stars ,a year ago,Lovely Algerian restaurant where nice food is served in a great atmosphere. Do not forget to try their tea as well!
68,Rainarai, 5 stars ,7 months ago,It is always a pleasure to go to this place. However service is very slow.
69,Rainarai, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicios, fantastically spiced food! A delight for all the senses. Simple honest food like it should be. One tip: Get more staff so that service is more speedy!"
70,Rainarai, 3 stars ,6 years ago,We had a function here and they kept running out of beer... usually every 30-40 minutes throughout the event... They even bought a few cases of Heineken and just left them outside so we could serve ourselves. .. oh yeah don't complain about the poor  service as they will call the police on you...
