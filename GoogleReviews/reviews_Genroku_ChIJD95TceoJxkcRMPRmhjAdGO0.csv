0,Genroku, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The personnel is really friendly. The food tastes super good! I believe the best option is to go there for lunch, the price is lower and you can still beneficiate of a nice and large menu of sushis, rice, noodles, starters, and main dishes! …"
1,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Having done several of these all you can eat sushi places in Amsterdam, this has to be one of the best. By far one of the bigger sushi options if the ones I've tried. The fish isn't paper thin. The dinner option gives you some great …"
2,Genroku, 5 stars ,a year ago,The all you can eat sushi menu is diverse. You have 5 rounds with 5 dishes per person to order. We surrendered at the 4th round lol. Though people come here for the sushi but I highly recommend the teriyaki grilled salmon. Definitely the …
3,Genroku, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Second time I've been here. On a Sunday evening, no reservation was needed for a group of five. There was quite some space, not really busy. Interior is nice. However the staff wasn't paying as much attention as should as I had to walk up …"

6,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good price (around 20 €) for a buffet with sushi and in Amsterdam.

7,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here for the all you can eat lunch. The restaurant is clean and the service is really good, they were really helpful with choosing gluten free options. The food was amazing and fresh, and lots of variety for an all you can eat -lunch. …"

WE were There on friday so WE paid 28.95 euro.  The staff is so Kind and the menu is great too. …"
10,Genroku, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty sushi with buffet option. Somewhat unusual method of ordering your dishes. Can order a maximum of 5 individual pieces of sushi per serving (you can have as many servings as you wish).
11,Genroku, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The first Sushi restaurant World wide I have ever been to be prepared for Gluten intollerant guests including gluten-free soysauce.
The only complaint would be the the low quality Chopstick."
12,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely worth it! Great quality and so many things to choose from. I'd definitely go here again for sushi!
13,Genroku, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice sushi place, reasonable prices for an all you can eat restaurant, good variety of sushi types and meat options, was quite empty during the week"
14,Genroku, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Ordered today with Uber Eat. What a disgrace! Ordered for €36+2,50 delivery. Look at my pictures. Small and poor pieces of low quality sushi. Supermarket quality at best, nothing special. I ordered for almost €40.- in total, no chopsticks! …"
15,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Simply a fantastic sushi restaurant! The food is great, well-prepared and well-presented. A big plus: the sashimi is included in the all-you-can-eat menu <3 …"
16,Genroku, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice sushi and the rest. All you can eat at a nice place in a nice street with a lot of restaurants
17,Genroku, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent service at Genroku Sushi place, the all you can eat is quite the feast, friendly staff, great atmosphere and delicious sushi and food. Highly recommend if you are in hurry. This place is lacking some authentic Japanese sushi dishes. Overall was good experience."
18,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service. Food is good and ample. Tables are roomy so you won't sit on your neighbor's lap, as opposed to many other AYCE sushi places. Soft relaxing music and a comfortable temperature make for a nice relaxing dinner. Food is not the …"
19,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really good sushi with a great concept. Although you can only order 5 items for 1 course (max. 5 courses) I could only manage 3 courses. The quality of sushi is good as they prepare every course right after ordering. The service is great, so I can definitely recommend this restaurant."
20,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Such a fun experience. The method of ordering is very unique, and we really enjoyed it. We felt we got our money's worth with the all-you-can-eat dinner price and all-you-can-drink price, although you can't get the all-you-can-drink option …"
21,Genroku, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Pretty average expensive sushi place, but yummy. They have A LOT of options which they dinner really explain to you but it's not a bad place for a meal before you hit the gay street."
22,Genroku, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The lunch all you can eat price was pretty good, but you don’t have too many options. Be sure to read the descriptions of what you order so you know what to expect...the “spicy tuna” is actually tuna salad... Additionally, the further into …"
23,Genroku, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Enough choice in sushi and other dishes. Friendly staff, quick service. If you like the 'All-you-can-eat' concept, you should try this restaurant."
24,Genroku, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty good budget sushi place. Nothing extraordinary, but if you wish to satisfy your sushi thirst, the Lunch or Dinner menus are what you're looking for. The service was helpful and friendly."
25,Genroku, 2 stars ,a year ago,I was in Genroku few month ago and I thought was one of the best in town. I've been last week was one of my worst experience with sushi. And I felt so sad cause I went with my friends and I suggested the restaurant.
26,Genroku, 1 star ,6 years ago,Value for money is not good. You have to choose a all you can eat or even all you can eat and drink option (about 34 Euros). Very inflexible (either entire table does one or other option). Very annoying process of ordering. They will fine you one euro per piece you did order but not eat. Way to expansive for mediocre sushi.
27,Genroku, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was.. not as great as I expected.
I heard a lot of good stories praising the prise/quality ratio, so maybe I was expecting too much. …"
28,Genroku, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Super sushi restaurant! The sushimi is included in the all you can eat menu. Although the app on the tablet can be developed a bit futher as there are no seperate tabs per sushi/grill category. The staff has been one of the friendliest! And this was the only restaurant that had some perfectly made salmon. Def worth visiting!!
29,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good quality of food , And amazing miso soup !"
30,Genroku, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I have been several times in Genroku and I just reserved for dinner again. The place is very well located, the dishes are sufficient and just what you expect in All You Can Eat. The waiting time is not long. Is a very good place for All You Can Eat and the prices are good (mind that they charge a different rate for children)"
31,Genroku, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"In the middle of the city center lies this Japanese all-you-can-eat restaurant.
And this isn't the only Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood but it is, in my opinion, one of the best. …"
32,Genroku, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"AYCE sushi.
The taste are mostly good and the ingredients feel fresh. But I don't recommend the udon soup and the stir fried vegetables, both dishes taste really terrible for me."
33,Genroku, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great quality sushi, very friendly staff and and overall good price. Drinks do get expensive when you order outside of the all you can eat menu. All in all our favorite sushi place in Amsterdam. 🍣"
34,Genroku, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Super nice restaurant. Friendly staff, fresh products and speedy service!
Price is pretty fair.
5 stars! :)"
35,Genroku, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Average sushi, but paying 13.50€ for 2 bottles of still water is not honest. We chose the all-you-can-eat formula (for lunch about 19€ per person), but it is a fake all-you-can-eat  since you have 5 rounds and in each round you can order 5 items per person."
36,Genroku, 4 stars ,a year ago,Top food
37,Genroku, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great sushi restaurant! We have dined at many sushi restaurants in the netherlands. Genroko belongs in our top 3. People that are complaining, it is absolutely redicilous and they are probably graving for attention. Great sushi, great service, nice waiters and allot of room (not crowded/industrial feeling of feeding customers asap)"
38,Genroku, 1 star ,5 years ago,The service is bad - slow and inefficient. The food was really bad quality and most of the dishes felt like they were kept in the refrigerator for a couple of days. The prices were extremely high and not proportional to what we got. After eating there I got stomach aches from the sushi!
39,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Eaten here several times. Very nice staff and the food quality is much better than other all you can eat restaurants! Worth going.
40,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food is very good and the price is fair
41,Genroku, 1 star ,3 years ago,"First of all the service was the WORST I have ever had the misfortune to suffer in a place that calls itself a restaurant. To start, only 2 of our party were given drinks. The 3 that were not delivered were chased up 3 times before they …"
42,Genroku, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Affordable all-you-can-eat concept. Very good food, good location, good service (albeit a bit slow as the place is usually quite full.)"
43,Genroku, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"The food was tasty and each set was made reasonably quickly. Service was poor, the man who served us was rude. They won't give you tap water either!"
44,Genroku, 1 star ,7 years ago,"Truly appalling, worthless.

Terrible, slow service from dim-witted staff. Scarce variety on the menu. Wrong …"
45,Genroku, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"My first all-you-can eat sushi experience - chosen to get out of the rain and not stray too far from my hotel. Once the rules were explained - about 5 items at a time and no more, and the ones that attract extra charge, it all seemed quite …"
46,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love eat here! It’s my favorite sushi restaurant .... the sushi is always so fresh! The service is also good  I just love it gonna back soon!!!
47,Genroku, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"poor service, small bites. price ok for what you get. but the service is the worst never got the atention from the staff. waiting for the bill takes forever. 25euros for all you cand eat"
48,Genroku, 5 stars ,6 years ago,All you can eat sushi which is fresh homemade. Never been disappointed here!
49,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best quality in the all-you-can-eat Japanese style restaurants of Amsterdam. Usually fully booked so get seat reservations in advance.

51,Genroku, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Went there for Lunch.

52,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's one of the greatest sushi restaurants for me in the summer it looks super inviting with vines growing on the outside walls , the inside gives if a very cosy atmosphere they have a selection of barbecue style dishes which are absolutely fantastic highly recommended for anyone that likes sushi or barbecue esque choices"
53,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Happy customer for over 5 years now. Best sushi in Amsterdam! Staff always attentive and welcoming.
54,Genroku, 1 star ,6 years ago,Just had udon and takoyaki. Udon tasted Chinese.  The takoyaki was deep fried and served with mayonnaise! If you want Japanese food don't go here. The waiter even told us he doesn't like Japanese food!
55,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If doing the all-you-can-eat menu, the 5 rounds offered are more than enough! Really tasty and nice atmosphere for groups"
56,Genroku, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice sushi and okay selection, but the service was poor and even asking for a small request of ""can you put the vegetarian food on a separate plate please?""  and he straight away just said no its to much hassle for the chef he is very busy, …"
57,Genroku, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had been going to Sumo the we stumbled across this gem.

60,Genroku, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"It´s a very nice little place. Though we didn´t ordered an ""all you can eat""-menu, the food delivery was not very fast. After a qustioning the service about my order, it was no problem at all and it was delievered immidiately. The food is …"
61,Genroku, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Standard lunch-sushi quality. Absolutely nothing special.

They even forgot to serve miso soup that was inlcuded in the ordered menu. When …"

63,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place, great food and service. We enjoyed and will definitely be back. The lamb chops were phenomenal, and sushi very fresh! Thank you!"
64,Genroku, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Rice bij the first order was very sour and dry. Old maybe. Ground floor was quite could. Staff quick and friendly.

66,Genroku, 4 stars ,9 years ago,The sushi is fresh and delicious each time we've eaten at Genroku.  Highlight for me was the vegetable tempura and the stir fried veggies.  Enough variety for a vegetarian too.  Good service.
67,Genroku, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"We thoroughly enjoyed the sushi at Genroku. They have great sushi for a reasonable price. A la carte or all you can eat.

69,Genroku, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food is ok, grilled salmon was half raw. Expensive drinks. Not the best sushi you can have in Amsterdam."
70,Genroku, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is one of my favorite Japanese  restaurant in Amsterdam.
Super fresh and super crispy! The sushi was nice and the service was great,freindly and fast."
71,Genroku, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Do not eat here if you're coeliac or gluten free. They don't know what it is. After ordering a meal with no gluten, crab sticks, soy sauce or battered fish I had to send my plate of basic sushi selection back 5 times. After 5th attempt I gave up amd went hungry."
72,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Maybe 5 round with 5 dishes for person sound no too much but if you will be there at the third one you will be full! Everthing was delicious expecially noodles with vegetables!
73,Genroku, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Just okay. Pretty decent place and food, but the selection of food are not as big as other all you can eat places in Amsterdam. It was a bit crampy and noisy on the ground floor."
74,Genroku, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Only 42 euro for unlimited tasty sushi, beer, wine, ice tea etc 🙂

77,Genroku, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Highly recommended. Very good quality throughout the menu (Sushi and more), moderate prices."
78,Genroku, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice quality, but little choice by all you can eat - not all available from printed menu"
79,Genroku, 1 star ,5 years ago,The sushi here is horrible! Sweet with a lot of saus and mayo and what not. They only had sweet soy saus.. very loud
80,Genroku, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Above average place for sushi. Serves sesame balls which is a favorite. Nice decoration. Private tables.

85,Genroku, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice place with a lot of variety, too bad they don't have duck though. The sushi was nice and the service was freindly and fast."
86,Genroku, 1 star ,8 years ago,One of the waiters was totally arrogant because we haven't decided our next round; that's not what I expect for my money. Otherwise it would have been decent but that is unacceptable.
87,Genroku, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is nice, but menu is confusing and the food arrived after mistakes of staff."
