0,Perry's Exotisch Food, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Rich selection of ready to serve Suriname cuisine. Something for everyone. Delicious spices you have not tasted before. This place is in my proven winner list.
1,Perry's Exotisch Food, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"This Suriname take-away has been an old favourite of mine in de Pijp for years - when you're on a good thing, stick to it.  I'm a roti fanatic (the potatoes ...yum) and, trust me, I know no place in Amsterdam that does a better Surinaam-style roti. Or even a cheaper one, for that matter. Yummm."
