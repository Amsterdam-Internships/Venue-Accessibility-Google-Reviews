0,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The oldest Indonesian restaurant in Amsterdam! So not miss this! We come here every time we are in Amsterdam. Remember to make a reservation as it gets packed really quickly. The food is absolutely delicious and the ambience of the space along with the wonderful staff makes it a memorable experience
1,Sama Sebo, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"I got the special plate and the chicken was dry and tasteless, it was probably made some time ago. Other food were okay, nothing significant. We paid 21 euros for this dish and I can say that it was one of the worst times I spent so much ‚Ä¶"
2,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing experience! Delicious food! Prompt and friendly service! We couldn't make a reservation online, but we called and got in the same day. If I could give Sama Sebo more than five stars, I would ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
3,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Delicious asian cuisine. Friendly staff.
They have vegan options too."
4,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is shockingly familiar although you may have never been there. It‚Äôs welcoming and relaxed, yet bustling. Hugs of the familiar abound. The bartenders and wait staff make you feel at home. I am not in my native country, but when ‚Ä¶"
5,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,What a great find. Was just round the corner from our hotel and we wanted to have an Indonesian meal while in the city. We couldn't have found anywhere better. It was quite full but the manager was keen to fit us in and got us two seats at ‚Ä¶
6,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Wonderful service! Daniel and his team serve up the best Indonesian food in the world. We had the special that included a taste of everything! 10/10 can‚Äôt wait to come back!
7,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Amazing! Show up hungry and get the Rijstafel and
8,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Absolutely delicious! We did the tasting menu - you really get to try it all with this and the flavors are incredible. Sebo was extremely friendly and chatted with us a while (love the family run feel of the place). Will definitely go back again whenever I am in town. Highly recommend!
9,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,3 months ago,"WARNING TO ALL TOURIST. A Very BAD Experience, as American tourist, our meal was presented differently from the locals that ordered the same meal. The service was poor, water glasses were empty throughout the meal."
10,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good Indo-Dutch cuisine. They make great Semur and Sayur Asam , and I love their Emping. Can be a tad busy so you better book much in advance."
11,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"To tell the truth, I haven‚Äôt had Indonesian cuisine in my life time. It was almost my first time to have it as far as I remember. So I cannot compare with an ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù thing, but it was great anyway."
12,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"I‚Äôve been in this restaurant multiple times during the last 10 years, for me is a must when I‚Äôm in Amsterdam. Fantastic food, great place, awesome service."
13,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,3 weeks ago,Food was decent but the lady boss/waitress was outrightly rude to us paying customers.
14,Sama Sebo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Mediocre food, nothing super remarkable in terms of flavor or experience. Very filling, and some creative dishes, but probably would not return. Would recommend asking locals for better Indonesian spots as I'm sure they exist."
15,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The meal I had at Sama Sebo was one of the best I've ever had. You have to get the rice table so you can try all the different dishes! I don't think there was a single thing on the table that I didn't like. It was all so delicious. The staff was awesome, so friendly and funny."
16,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,a year ago,Currently only serves take away order due to pandemic. The food tastes good considering that most Indonesian spices are not grown in Europe. The spicy sambal is very recommended. Here is the photo of nasi goreng and rendang. The nasi goreng itself is plain so mix and stir it with rendang.
17,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Overall the foods are delicious.. The rendang is little less different to Indonesian rendang. But satay kambing is really help me to fulfill my needs for Indonesian food.
18,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Fast service and tasty indonesian food. The gado gado was really nice. They have also the mixed rice but it was a bit pricey for what it is. Nasi goreng set was 19 euros.
19,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing spot! Loved the atmosphere and friendly, funny staff. Crispy chicken and the rendang were our favorites.. Will deffo come back here!"
20,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you're around the Rijksmuseum or Vondelpark and are craving good authentic Indonesian food, this is a must visit. ‚Ä¶"
21,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"The food is insanely tasty. I recommend!

Very cosy place, excellent service (the people that work there are super friendly), good atmosphere."
22,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice shrimps with an incredible red hot souse, OMG!!! Eat it here every time I am in Amsterdam! Now they have not only Heineken beer (it was so sad before) bur also an Affligem blonde, so you have a choice, at last!"
23,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have tried a few rice plates in Amsterdam and this is hands down the best for service, ambiance, number of dishes and flavor.
I think some of the staff have been here since they opened."
24,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"First experience in an Indonesian restaurant for the family and it was a total success. We went for the lunch menus: rise one (Nasi Rames) and noodles one (Bami Rames), both good and a little bit spicy. Both recommended though. ‚Ä¶"
25,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic rice table. Don't even think of ordering a dessert: you won't have any space for it üòã
26,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Welcoming restaurant. They have a nice simple plate with lots of different things which allows to taste a little bit of everything without being too filling for 18‚Ç¨. There's a rice and noodle version of it.
27,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food! The sambal tahu and goreng tempeh are so very good! So is the gado gado and randeng. Highly recommend!
28,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good service, they have a lunch selection of you don't want to choose from their variety of dishes"
29,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food and service, take the rice platter! Spicy but so good üòã"
30,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"really friendly waiter, they understand that not everyone can pay the per person price and are willing to let you share plates. me and my friends got 3 lunch plates of rijsttafel with three different bases for the 5 of us and it worked out ‚Ä¶"
31,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,2 years ago,DO NOT EAT HERE!  I have never written a review before but am compelled to do so after the worst lunch ever. It is listed as an Indonesian restaurant and the only thing Indonesian is the list of dishes with Indonesian names. We took the ‚Ä¶
32,Sama Sebo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Good but over the years I have been going there they seem to be straying from the original rijst tafel.
33,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,indonesian rice table banquet. lucky to get reservation on same day. nice waiters. great tasting food and Heineken beer. Close to Museumplein and Vondel Park.
34,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,a month ago,Great personal and delicious food.
35,Sama Sebo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good little restaurant.
Nice food but my rice was overdone. I would recommend their mix selection dish. I found it bit over seasoned and bit too spicy for my taste, but this is my ‚Ä¶"
36,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Lovely place and friendly staff
37,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One awesome restaurant. I got it recommended from a friend in the USA, and he was totally right. I went there with a colleague from Indonesia and he told me that it was so great. I was happy about the food, the service and the quality. It's worth to got there and take the dish (forgot the name). But hell yes!"
38,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved this Indonesian restaurant with an eclectic interior.
39,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent Indonesian food! you can't always get Indonesian food everywhere in the world but this is one of the best places to try it if you can. you may think the prices are a little high but when you see the quantity and quality of the food you won't think that anymore. Totally worth it go visit!
40,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We were starving, had no clue what to order. All four of us went with the waiter's recommendation and it was delicious. Several dishes on a plate, at least that's what it seemed like, but fresh and delicious. Staff were great, restaurant was busy and popular. Would definitely recommend, we all loved it."
41,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Food was decent, though nothing to write home about. The multiple tiny platters displayed made the food experience more interesting and fun. The price was expensive for the quality of food and taste however. Our waiter was exceptionally ‚Ä¶"
42,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,2 years ago,When we went to the restaurant it was fully booked for the night so we made reservations for the day after but this is Amstertam's oldest and the WORST Indonesian restaurant. The waiter suggested the Sambal chicken and Beef Randang as we ‚Ä¶
43,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I want to give a more odd review than I normally do. I love it here, because it is, I think, the best 'rusttafel' set in a Stanley Kubrick setting of retro delight. Along with the most elegant, charming and classy staff. The food is great.....but I really love the setting  and staff, along with the food....keep doing what you do."
44,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love this place. Third time there. You either have to book or be prepared to stand and wait for a bit. I like to sit at the bar to eat. Food is delicious. Will definitely be going back.
45,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very very nice place. Food was really good, and more than enough. We had the rijsttafel and we were happy with everything. A lot of tasty choices, the meatballs are killer good, and the chicken is to die for. Service was excellent as well, very kind people. very much recommended!"
46,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very poor quality of food. Big bowl of deep fried mush put together. Over done. Hair in food. Just very poor and disappointing. 20 euro each for one lunch plate and was rubbish! Do not recommend. Travelled Indonesia so I know what I'm talking about
47,Sama Sebo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was very attentive, but the food on my combo plate was heavy (thick sauce on the skewers) and overcooked (chicken and beans). ‚Ä¶"
48,Sama Sebo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Bad food! I ordered a Nasi Goreng and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was totally different that what I have usually had in any Indonesian restaurants earlier. No fried eggs, rice was not boiled well, dish was sweet and not even ‚Ä¶"
49,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"sat down and was quickly served the set menu, which consists of several tasty dishes. lot of food for 2 people. in fact, 2 waiters commented on how impressed they were at my eating skills after I finished everything after my wife was done with her meal. would recommend."
50,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We had the Bami mixed platter. It was tasty and it was not too much food as we thought it could be. Service is good. The only thing to improve is adding some explanations to the menu for those who are not familiar with Indonesian food.
51,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We arrived asked for a table for 3 at 5.30 was told the restaurant was full and asked to eat at the bar or at the one table in the bar or told to come back at 7.30. We chose the table and ordered, minutes later a lady and her 2 children ‚Ä¶"
52,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely delicious food. You can order a large carte, but I'd recommend getting the special, which is a little bit of everything. You can control the spice level, as they provide sauces on the side. You will not be disappointed!"
53,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Love love loved it. I cannot recommend it enough. It was very crowded but we managed to snag the last two seats before people were told it would be an hour wait. The food was so good we came back for more!
54,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely wonderful in every way. Service, ambience and the food!!! We completely loved it, and will go again. Long, festive dinner out of any night. Delicious, varied, perfect portions, a huge treat!"
55,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"OMG, the Rijstafel is sssooo gooood"
56,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I had never tried a Rijsttafel before. It was an excellent choice by my friend Jens. There was an array of tapas style choices. It was a delicious first experience, and a must try again."
57,Sama Sebo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Unfortunately I have to echo some of the people here and not recommend this place. While the food is reasonable and fairly priced for the amount, waiters are not too careful and I was practically forced to ask for the whole menu (22‚Ç¨) of which I could barely eat half."
58,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Food was good but very expensive at twenty euros for a plate of over-cooked vegetables and rice. The ‚Äútall guy‚Äù mentioned by someone else couldn‚Äôt get rid of us fast enough. He slammed our plates down and then crumpled our placemats in front of us when we were done - boarded on hostile. This might not be a great place for tourists.
59,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I hate to be the negative guy, but this was honestly the worst Indonesian food we ever ate. I have had 4 times more tasty food in simple warungs that were less than half the price with twice the portion size.. Do the math on that one. No, ‚Ä¶"
60,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"There is a reason its the oldest Rijstaffel in Amsterdam. Very worth the visit. Solid value, we couldn't finish our meal it was so massive!"
61,Sama Sebo, 3 stars ,9 years ago,"Our hopes for Amsterdam's reistafel experience were sorely dashed and at a massive 80 euros, the experience was by no means cheap! The food was really dreadful. Friendly service but I would certainly never go again and advise others to steer well clear!"
62,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Splurge and get the rice table. Indonesian food is such a staple in Amsterdam, and this place is absolutely amazing. So glad to have stumbled into it on vacation. Loved it!!"
63,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"It was a great place to eat! This restaurant is very near to Rijksmuseum. The service is super friendly, beer is good and the food is tasty in addition to large portions. It is also full of locals, so it is not a tourist trap type of place."
64,Sama Sebo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Bit touristy but great food. If you know the Indonesian kit hen, make sure you order what you like otherwise the Rijsttafel is a good introduction to that kitchen"
65,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely food. Asked for vegetarian meal and had a delicious nasi goreng. Waiter also brought over veg kroepoek with satay sauce. Yum!
66,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The 'rice table' menu option is amazing. The place is always packed, so your dinner will be busy, but not in an obnoxious way. The place is just pleasantly bustling with life."
67,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Good food and friendly waiters
68,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Sama Sebo is not just a restaurant; Sama Sebo is an Amsterdam experience. Though it is located on a main street, it will only take you to put in one step into the restaurant to feel like you're entering one of those old hidden restaurants ‚Ä¶"
69,Sama Sebo, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The food here was terrible. I have had Indonesian food before and this restaurant wasn't even comparable. Bland tasting, very salty and non-authentic spices and textures. The service was nice and the inside decor felt elegant but I would not go back."
70,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very nice Indonesian place with traditional food. If you havent tried rijsplatter before you can expect a huge variety of taste and flavor from asian cuisine. The evening was a bit disturbed by a group of noisy british tourists, but that is not the restaurant's fault!"
71,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,2 years ago,Very overpriced food. Ok quality but the food is different from what we get in other Indonesian restaurants. We asked for water but didn‚Äôt expect to get 2 small bottles of water for 6‚Ç¨. Not recommend
72,Sama Sebo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We had a reservation for 2 Adults and a child in a high chair. Wenn we arived we were told, that our table is not ready yet, so we waited 20 Minutes with our hungry 2 year old daughter. Then we were seated on the smallest table in the ‚Ä¶"
73,Sama Sebo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Indonesian staff super nice, Dutch waiters extremely rude. Quite pricy (0,2L water is 3‚Ç¨!). Will look for other Indonesian places."
74,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, but not the best I ate.
We had the rice table and most of the food was ok.
Try to eat at 12:30, then you might not have to wait."
75,Sama Sebo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is good, atmosphere is nice and staff are friendly. However it‚Äôs a bit pricy side 34 euros per person for the experience.  Though they do have a la carte."
76,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Great time and decent food. I will be back
77,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place has treated us great for years!!  Always accommodating, and the food is amazing.  You know this place is great because the staff has been there for years and it is always packed.  Try this place, you won't be dissapointed"
78,Sama Sebo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was good. If a little pricey. But the staff were rather brisk/short with us. Very popular though. The place was packed!
79,Sama Sebo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"OK let be known I have eaten this meal all over the world. Jakarta Indonesia , Bali, Da Nang, Singapore, Den Haag, Leiden, Schevenginen, NYC, Miami, Philadelphia LA,. Out of all of them this place is the best by far. My grandmothers cousin ‚Ä¶"

While the food is reasonable and fairly priced for the amount, waiters are not too careful and I was practically forced to ask for the whole menu (22‚Ç¨) of which I could barely eat half."
