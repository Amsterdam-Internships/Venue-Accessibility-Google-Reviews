1,Vermeer, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really good experience. Service is casual and perfect. The food was fabulous, directly from their farm. We did some extraordinary culinary discoveries. Thank you for everything!"
2,Vermeer, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Vermeer a Dutch classic you must have visited onces. English Chef using a lot of veggies in his menu's. A set menu (choose number of courses). Of course using seasonal ingredients it's a refined kitchen with (luckily) not too much going on ‚Ä¶
3,Vermeer, 5 stars ,a month ago,Food was great. Really innovative and different to what I would normally go for. The taster menu was a fab choice. Service was top quality and the entire team made my partners birthday really special. Would highly recommend.

5,Vermeer, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Excellent service, the ambience is good, it is located in the city centre, a very good location close to the Amsterdam Central station. Food is average to be honest, especially the Dutch duck, which is the main course, and is a bit pricey."

10,Vermeer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went here for my mom's birthday. The staff was super friendly, gave my mime several top ups. Food was amazing, just be prepared to get more dished than the numbe rod courses you choose. We ordered the 6 course and had 12 in total haha üòÇ Can definitely recommend this place."
11,Vermeer, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Truly amazing! The staff were very friendly, our sommelier was brilliant, very knowledgeable and good banter. Went for the eight courses and ended up with about 12, each one was innovative and perfectly executed.  The dining room was cosy but elegant and we had a good laugh with the table next to us!  Would definitely recommend!!"
12,Vermeer, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We had an enjoyable dinner at Restaurant Vermeer. All of the dishes were well done, but few were particularly memorable. The standouts were the brussel sprout (you only get one delicious charred morsel) and the tourte de gibier, which was rich and gamey."
13,Vermeer, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is a Google Maps 5* spot for sure - you have to give it that much. Within its league of fine dining restaurants though, while Vermeer blows me away with its friendly and hospitable service as well as regular servings of well ‚Ä¶"

26,Vermeer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We enjoyed an excellent four course menu -augnented with quite a number of amuses. Served impeccably by a brigade of professional yet relaxed waiters. Imaginative cooking and also great wine pairings, poured from magnum sized bottles, even for the Sauternes dessert wine. Overall an outstanding experience."
27,Vermeer, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Last year my husband took me here for my birthday. My first Michelin Star Restaurant experience, and it was good! Unbelievable how chef Chris Naylor is able to put so much flavor in each and every dish, and service is outstanding. ‚Ä¶"

29,Vermeer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very attentive yet unintrusive Service from all members of staff. We had the 5 course tasting menu and a lovely bottle of Italian white wine. The food was delicious and with the amuse bouche & palat cleansers I managed to be full after the courses.
30,Vermeer, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fantastic restaurant. They went above and beyond to serve us the best they could and it was truly incredible. I have highly positive memories from this restaurant but something that stood out to me was that the butter they served with the bread was absolutely incredible.
31,Vermeer, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A true hidden gem for non locals. If you are in the area I give this establishment my highest recommendation. The chef is a genius. We did the tasting menu and every course was an epicurean delight! Can't say much more than that. A delightful surprise!

35,Vermeer, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful meal, impeccable service.  We had a four course meal, but they brought several bites in between - we were stuffed, and we got to try raw shrimp... Literally they were alive and fighting me inside of my mouth.  What an experience - highly recommended for a beautiful dinner in Amsterdam!"
36,Vermeer, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"We were significantly underwhelmed by Vermeer. The service was very slow, confusing, and at times outright bad ‚Äì we had to ask multiple times to get menus and to order drinks, we were passed off between various servers multiple times for ‚Ä¶"

40,Vermeer, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful dinner in a beautiful room. We especially loved the creative use of vegetables throughout the many servings, for instance the brussel sprouts prepared on the branch/stalk and only gently removed and served at the table."
41,Vermeer, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The six course menu with wine package was great. It was a truly great experience. The sommelier (Simon Veldman) had ""contagious"" enthusiasm, but some of the other staff seemed less interested."

43,Vermeer, 5 stars ,5 years ago,An excellent meal paired with excellent service. The presentations of each course were all quite creative. My favorite dishes were the scallop and the venison.

Incredible dishes : structure of any aliments incredible (sea bass, aspergus.....) ‚Ä¶"
45,Vermeer, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The service was good but the food is terrible and very overpriced. Sometimes it's great to spend good money on good food - this is NOT the case here. We did not leave hungry, but did not enjoy our meal either. The meal took over 3 hours. Save your money and time and stay away."
46,Vermeer, 1 star ,2 years ago,"You get 1 star. Why? Because the lights were on but no-one was home. Literally. The door was open, I walked around the entire restaurant 3 times shouting hello, on a Friday night... And not a soul to be found. Came many miles. No signs nothing."
47,Vermeer, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had more refined Michelin starred dines in my time, but this was consistently just amazing. Sommelier knew his stuff and offered wines that paired particularly well."
48,Vermeer, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fabulous food; even better than the prior time 2 months ago.  Very friendly and knowledgeable servers.  Brilliant dessert wine recommendation - Malus X Feminam

51,Vermeer, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Precious to a fault, overpriced, ""cute"" food. I had hoped the days of being
presented with 2 miniature carrots were over, but not here, alas. Overly spare decor (no carpeting of any sort, bare walls) makes noise level grow considerably after the addition of 4 people. The sort of place that makes one long for Lutece and Le Pavillion."
