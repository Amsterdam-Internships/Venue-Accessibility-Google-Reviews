0,Sugo, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Delicious pizza, lovely service, the large was a lot for one person,  I took a third home and it was a perfect lunch the next day. Next time I would get two different smalls. Great place for families and a casual stop."
1,Sugo, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Cute place, interior is very nice. The pizzas however, were a bit disappointing. I chose a mix of three slices: tuna (not a fan at all, a bit watery), vegan karma kebab (didn‚Äôt have any taste) and the caramelized onions and sriracha (very ‚Ä¶"
2,Sugo, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"The food was nice and delicious!
It seems to be quiet in the restaurant, not a lot of people but it would be more vibey if there was music playing on the background, since I saw speakers upstairs too."
3,Sugo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"For me the best Pizza I have ever had. There are certain things that I always plan to visit when coming to Amsterdam and going to Sugo Pizza is always number 1. The variety and quality of the Pizza is just unbeatable, I love the dough! ‚Ä¶"
4,Sugo, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Pizza, lasagna, sandwiches. Nice place for a quick bite."
5,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The pizza's were very delicious! They got a wide variety of flavors and they were very nice and wel mannered as well. The waiter explained the concept for us when we have taken our seats. We got two slices for each person and drinks. The ‚Ä¶
6,Sugo, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"The pizza is okay but the short haired ""store manager"" lady is extremely problematic. My friend ordered a slice of pizza and asked for tap water and she refused to give it to us saying we only ordered one slice. Seriously what the heck? Have you heard of management and service?"
7,Sugo, 5 stars ,a year ago,I think the pizzas here are really delicious even though I heard some negative comments about the pizza quality. The reason might be the dough because it's quite thick when compared to regular pizzas but it's crispy and very delicious to me so I'll definitely come back. I even got a very cute surprise for my take away order! ‚ô•Ô∏è
8,Sugo, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Very delicious!  Vegan option is good as well.
9,Sugo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Starter was a Delicious ""big üçë"" salade. That we couldn't finish R pizza's & desserts. Had to take it with us & finish them of later. ‚Ä¶"
10,Sugo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Vero good pizza in Amsterdam. The quality of the dough is super good but I give 4 stara only because some products they use on the pizza are not always the high standard. Overall it is definitely a place to go for pizza.
11,Sugo, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Super delish!  Awesome take on urban, fast food pizza with a great diverse selection.   A tad on the expensive side these days tho (I remember getting a much better bang for buck a couple years ago)."
12,Sugo, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Pizza ok! I feel it can improve in terms of quality, but it‚Äôs a quite unique concept around here, there aren‚Äôt many pizza al taglio places in AMS and it‚Äôs extremely similar to an Italian one! It makes you feel there."
13,Sugo, 1 star ,4 months ago,After 1h30 still no order - I contacted them and they told me the driver was on its way ( it‚Äôs 2 mn from my place ) after another 30 mn I called again and they said they needed 30 mn to prepare the order. So it would have been 2 hours for ‚Ä¶
14,Sugo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Different than the regular thin or thick crust pizzas you get everywhere.
I had the mushroom pizza (recommended by the staff) and gardenia pizza with extra cheese. I personally really liked it. Definitely a must try place in Amsterdam."
15,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The pizzas were delicious and crunchy with great prices. The service was great. They're really friendly to the customers (to us) although we didn't speak with a proper English. Really recommended.
16,Sugo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my local pizza places that has plenty of meat and vegetarian options.
In short, 4 Stars for friendly staff, clean establishment, and fresh (but relatively expensive) pizza. ‚Ä¶"
17,Sugo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The pizza slices were good and the staff was friendly. The coffee was not too bad too. Good place to get some food while you're on the go.
18,Sugo, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Decent pizza for relatively cheap price. Better to take away as you need to wait a while before you get served otherwise
19,Sugo, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"I appreciate that they have vegan options, but they make you wait for a long time even if there is no one else. Moreover, my slice of pizza was burnt."
20,Sugo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great, affordable pan pizza place in Amsterdam!  We especially loved it because they had several vegan options.  Pizzas are already made.  You pick from the selection and they heat it in their pizza oven.  Tasty, quick, and affordable!"
21,Sugo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Such a wonderful and neat little restsurant. The pizza is amazing and the staff may be even more amazing. Unfortunately they don't have gluten free pizza, but because the dough is natural you won't have to worry about it. The prizes are also really good with ‚Ç¨3.99 per slice, an dht edrinks are also pretty well priced."
22,Sugo, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great pizza and service. I stayed for a bit and enjoyed the music too. Nice staff.
23,Sugo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious pizza and many options to choose from. This place truly has amazing quality and the last time I had a pizza like this, was in Italy."

27,Sugo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"the closest thing in Amsterdam to the squares pizza's of Rome. prices are good and not too expensive. place is nice design and team is always friendly. my only recommend to the management to  let the clients add their on spices as Tabasco, oregano and zo in a small area by the door. this was missing!"

31,Sugo, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Sugo a la Casa! Fresh pizza ready to bake off at home and so we did...and yes we nailed it. The only downside is that Sugo only has stores in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Our kids love it, so it's worth the detour."
32,Sugo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We came in late so understandibly they didnt have many vegan slices left, but we had the vegan margarita and it was very good!"
33,Sugo, 1 star ,9 months ago,Totally disappointed about the desserts. Doesn‚Äôt look like the pictures on the website! And I am not even talking about the taste...

43,Sugo, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Good pizza but location is not so nice to dine in. Would recommend to take the pizza to go.
44,Sugo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"We ordered pizza and pasta,... Oeps! I mean two pasta's! Or...oke.. It was 1 lasagna and 1 pasta, but after a some glasses of gin I forgot what my girlfriend ordered. üòÇ But what I didn't forget,.... That this was fenomenal! Great lasagna, great pasta! As soon as Corona is over, I'm going back for a table for 2!"

48,Sugo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,very tasty food and nice service. extra stars for the music alone. so good
49,Sugo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for a quick but nice bite to eat. Lots of locations across Amsterdam (also found one in Rotterdam. Reasonable price for nice pizza. The slice sizes (full or half) mean you can try a variety of flavours of you cant decide. Lots of options for everyone, even fussy ones."
50,Sugo, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Very tasty pizza, however arrogant personnel. This was the second time I came to get pizza and they were closing way too early. I mean, they were closing shop at 21.15 while they even said their closing time is 22.00. I don't understand why they are closing earlier than they mention. Very disappointing again."
51,Sugo, 1 star ,a year ago,"Worst experience ever.
Last sunday me and my boyfriend decided to order a Sugo pizza at this place.  It took more than 1,5 hour before the pizza's has arrived. ‚Ä¶"

53,Sugo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"So, I have to say that I have always ordered online from Sugo, but today I was in the Pijp and I decided to stop to eat a bite of some fresh and amazing pizza, so I went in and I ordered a quattro formaggi and I asked if they had one of my ‚Ä¶"
54,Sugo, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Just not good and in no way ""italien kitchen""! The worst tuna-pizza ever!"
55,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,They have very different toppings on the Pizza here. Really liked it!
56,Sugo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Some delicious pizza! Love the red and green pesto ones. Goat cheese one is recommended too if you're into that. Apparently 20 grams of protein per slice, which us very impressive!"

60,Sugo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The pizzas are great and price is great too for what they are. Customer service with the person who served me was cheaper than the pizza slice. To the guy with the shaved head, tanned and a stubble beard; I and the other people who would ‚Ä¶"
61,Sugo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nothing special dough toppings sliced. Yet it is nice to have places like this where you can grab a quick tasty cheapish snack on the go. I remember a few years ago the only street food was hotdogs üå≠.... üòí ‚Ä¶
62,Sugo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Always great pizza, room to sit upstairs even at 6pm, great tiramisu. Pretty cheap eats for Amsterdam. Friendly but very busy staff. We left completely stuffed, ordering just four pieces for three people (around 14 euro)."
63,Sugo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty good, best pizza I've had in Amsterdam. Worth a try."
64,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fast, tasty, good price... many vegetarian slices. Best of this type of pizzeria, where you can try several various pizza slices. We liked tiramisu as well. I would recommend Sugo if you are nearby for lunch or dinner"
65,Sugo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best pizza al taglio i know in Amsterdam. I would say quite good also compared to Italian standards! They have a very wide choice and the place is very cozy for eating a quick bite inside. Only downside the prices, which are a bit high. But for a pizza place in De Pijp I cannot expect much less... Definitely try it out!"
66,Sugo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent pizza- meat- vegetarian-vegan options- fluffy- focaccia style pizza you can get 1/2 + 1/2 slices and try all kinds! Fresh salads, the goat cheese salad was delicious. And cannoli for dessert- almond brittle shell stuffed with ‚Ä¶"

69,Sugo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,With love from Italy! I find this place very cozy! They have a great variety of pizzas! Nice place to come with friends! You can also bring your laptop here and use it while you eat! Free-Wifi access! Very friendly staff!
70,Sugo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The pizzas are tasty with quality ingredients. The stuff is very polite & friendly. I find the prices a bit high for a slice of pizza, but that's my only remark about Sugo."
71,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I really love this pizzeria. Always a fabulous selection of pizza slices, great service and a pleasant vibe. Regularly got take aways and sat in. Absolutely amazing nut brittle and  chocolate fondant caneloni that is unparalleled. I loved the tip jars."
72,Sugo, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Quick. Average price. Good choice of toppings.   Crust tasted like cardboard.  I am a pizza snob though, grew up in NY.  This place wouldn't last a week back home."

74,Sugo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The pizza is not bad and the price are good, but the personal is not nice and moody. But the worst is this place has mice! After having eaten I discovered with disgust a small mouse alive under my table, probably waiting something to fall ‚Ä¶"

76,Sugo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Sugo is not trendy Neopolitan, it's a unique presentation and flavor, well-crafted, Crunchy. Yummy and comforting. Great for groups because you buy by the (rectangular) slice and can try many varieties. Vegan and vegetarian options that ‚Ä¶"
77,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place. It's tucked away between other shops, and it's a very cozy little place. There is a great selection of pizza available by the slice, and the prices are reasonable. ‚Ä¶"
78,Sugo, 1 star ,4 years ago,Not as good as it was. They now have a chef who cannot stop whistling. .Also do not fill in their online evaluation card. They get your e-mail to send you promo stuff but the promised free pizza voucher never arrives.
79,Sugo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Extraordinary good pizza for a good price! Best of all is that it's sold in slices, so you don't have to choose one. Good stop for a quick snack, lunch or cheap dinner."
80,Sugo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great pizza, good flavours and toppings. Awesome tiramisu. Delivery was fast!"
81,Sugo, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's OK. Pizza isn't pizza at all, rather call it a focaccia or something similar. Place itself is pleasant and the selection of drinks too."
82,Sugo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,If you want to understand what really pizza gourmet is then you gotta visit this place and enjoy their high quality products for a fair price. Gentle staff and a cozy place complete the experience.
83,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great choice of pizza slices on light base. About half varieties are vegetarian with vegan made to order. Two slices make a good sized meal.
84,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It¬¥s one thing to eat goood food. The other thing what makes us people happy, are other happy people. The staff at Sugo at the Sarphatipark is just wonderful. Full of good vibes and I always have a good reason to go there, because the ‚Ä¶"
85,Sugo, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Some of the best pizza you'll find in Amsterdam.

89,Sugo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very best pizza ever!
90,Sugo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good selection with 3 vegan options, extremely tasty. I would be wary with dietary requirements due to allergies as I can see cross contamination of nuts etc may be quite easily done."
91,Sugo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place for Italian üç∫ and some good üçï. They also have Vegan üçï and they serve by slices. They also have enough sitting so if you want some downtime, Sugo is a good place to eat and drink."
92,Sugo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food is good but service is super slow.

102,Sugo, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"High variety of authentic pizza's from rome, with dough that is crispy at the bottom but fluffy and soft in the middle at the top, resulting in a highly enjoyable experience."
103,Sugo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful pizza and friendly stuff. Interior is cozy but quite small, so sitting there with big company can be a bit inconvenient."
104,Sugo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"In Dutch  heel Lekker, the service is also awesome. Nice Ambiance. Delish. Super cool and fun Vrouws. Best part something differentü§òüèª"
