0,Westergasterras, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Gorgeous location with a large, comfortable terrace. Food was tasty (although prices seemed a bit high for some items) and service was friendly. Make a reservation as it got really busy, and note that you currently have to order at the bar due to the COVID situation."
1,Westergasterras, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Go here almost every weekend with the kids. Kids can play outside. Service has improved. Dogs allowed. Good for drinks, lunch is ok. Nicely located in Westerpark. Good sunbeams from 12:00-18:00"

3,Westergasterras, 1 star ,6 months ago,Not kid friendly at all. There was a TV on displaying a horror zombie slasher game. No way to go to the restroom without my son being exposed to it. Upon kindly asking the staff to move the screen / change what was on it I was told off by …

18,Westergasterras, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice spot with lovely cafe and terrace. I came here 20 years ago and the place was squatted. Back then the gave you a can of bear from a box on the floor for 50cts. Now it is a yuppie hipster paradise. Still a nice spot though
19,Westergasterras, 1 star ,a year ago,"At least one of the staff members never heard of a warmig welcome nor good and polite communication I suppose. Me, my son and my bestie were refused in a very rude way because we had 2 steps with us. Mind you, we have been to tiny places …"

26,Westergasterras, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We held a major conference in the location next to this restaurant. In the end, the restaurant mismanaged our agreement and bills and would take no responsibility for an error that cost us thousands. I recommend not using them for catering."

It could be a perfect place for studying or working with your laptop but they have no internet, which they should fix."
28,Westergasterras, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful hidden spot, but the service isn't good. Been there several times and the same story repeats again and again - you have to wait a long time until served, the food and drinks are really nothing special and the prices are not cheap."

35,Westergasterras, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely little venue. There are actually 4 club rooms here. Westerunie, Westerliefde, Transformerhuis and [can't remember the last but it's very small]. Overall it's comparable with a venue like Egg London. The rooms are sometimes used …"
36,Westergasterras, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"My favorite place for dates! In summer the big terrace is open and you can enjoy the evening outside, in winter the inside is still big enough to find a comfortable spot and still be quiet."
