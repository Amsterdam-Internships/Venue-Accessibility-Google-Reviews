1,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Yum!!! I really love this place for the decor, the creative dishes, and service. The food was good but not exceptional in my opinion. I would definitely recommend the burgers and ‚Äúbetterballs‚Äù but not necessarily the fries. If you only have ‚Ä¶"

4,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"We ordered the vegan ribs with fries, chicken salad, sweet potato fries and calamari. From the four, I have to say that the calamari was my favorite. It has a nice chew like actual squids would have. Sweet potato fries was also delicious, ‚Ä¶"

Defo coming back and bringing more friends there!!"
10,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Super tasty burgers! Leave you feeling satisfied but not heavy. Service was alright. Some of the sauces are a tad too sweet, that's the only negative I'd have."
11,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great experience! Super tasty, huge choice, reasonable portions, quick service. The prices are like in any other restaurant. I recommend to try it out ;)"

13,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I‚Äôm not particular vegan but I love the food here! They have a great variety and provide a great service. The vegan junk food bar is one of the places that I always visit when I‚Äôm in Amsterdam! Definitely worth a try, even for non-vegans!"
14,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Not vegan, but really enjoyed the meal! Had some fun French fry variations, which were all tasty. The food was super filling and the service was really fast, we received our food within 20 minutes of sitting down. The servers were also really attentive and good about coming over to reorder drinks. Will definitely be back!"
15,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,7 months ago,We absolutely love the food but it takes ONE HOUR for a burger to arrive and they are not even checking if you need more drinks while you wait. :( It has been the same service in other units of this chain. The cocktail was delicious but I doubt there was any alcohol in there ü•≤
16,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I love it, the best vegan junk food i ever had.

But you need to be patient in case of waiting until you get seated and for your food."
17,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I always enjoy my visits to VJFB and my first visit to this location didn't disappoint. The service is also great, with super friendly helpful staff. VJFB definitely his the spot for a junk food craving. ‚Ä¶"
18,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Enjoyable vegan food experience. I would suggest that you are paying for the presentation more than anything, but the staff were very chatty and friendly. Potentially not worth the typically long queue's, but still worth a visit."
19,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The food is delicious and a lot to choose from.
On top of that, the staff is so helpful and well organized and friendly, making the experience even more enjoyable. ‚Ä¶"
20,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"It was an excellent surprise cause the vegetables steak in the burger is just super tasty and really close to the real meat , it was one of the best vegan restaurant I've ever tried ."
21,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Totally understand why this place is so popular. The food is a great way to eat vegan while remaining close to traditional 'junkfood'. It's tasty. Drinks are great as well, good atmosphere and friendly staff. Try the bitterballs!"
22,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is a must try for anyone looking for an incredible scrumptious meal which doesn‚Äôt have any non-vegetarian. The flavours were brilliant and the burger and the shawarma were both made to perfection. The colours of the burger made for an ‚Ä¶
23,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,9 months ago,Good burger for a vegan place. Heavy though so you do get filled up quickly. Didn‚Äôt like the bun too much. Chips were great.
24,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Extremely good burgers what we orderd at the vegan junk food bar (mc cruelty free) plus sweet potato fries. I would really recommend it to every one. It was sooo delicious. The waiter was beyond friendly and the interior is super cool!!!
25,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Waited a long time to get a table, our waitress never ordered my portion of the food so I had to end up waiting over an hour and a half for me Food. The other members of the staff were very friendly, and the food was exceptional. The rib fries are to die for."
26,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Amazing concept and menu! Vegan fried shrimps that taste better than actual fried shrimp, I mean, that was something I hadn‚Äôt had before. This place definitely takes the boring stigma out of the word ‚Äòvegan‚Äô. Highly recommend visiting even if you just come to the city as a tourist."
27,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The service was very kind and friendly, food is delicious, great vegan option in amsterdam - we chose pizza and daddy burger - g r e a t!!"

29,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cash or debit card only veggie based burger and more joint! Great food. Converted this meat lover to Vegan burgers. Can‚Äôt say much else. The truffle fries weren‚Äôt that great but with the BBQ sauce all was good. A bit pricey but well worth it. Had it been more reasonably priced 5 stars for sure.
30,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"The food was absolutely amazing, a little on the pricier side but 1000% worth it. I'm already excited to take my vegan friends there. And the person who served me was incredibly nice!"
31,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome vegan food, great quality and flavour. Good prices, nice location and reasonable prices. My one negative would be the volume of the music, but maybe because we sat under the speakers...aside from that the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. Service was attentive but not intrusive. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place."
32,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very impressed and beyond our expectations. My sisters and I have to rush back to airport. The server was super friendly and patient. The order came fast and the food was so beautiful to look at n eat. Washroom is not working. The flush needs to be fixed.
33,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Very nice service and of course tasty food. The burgers looked soo fancy, they colered the bread. It's pretty cool. They serve very fast, and the burger killed your hunger. I will come there again for sure. I enjoyed it a lot. Also the toilets are clean and modern. But the wifi doesn't worked unfortunately"

37,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really very good. Ordered the ""salmon/tuna"" sashimi which was so good that my daughter who is a sashimi freak could hardly tell the difference. Great burgers, truffle fries and other really great 'junk food'. Good range of drinks/cocktails makes for a great experience. This place is always busy so be prepared to wait."
38,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I just love their Notorious Sumo burger! It so delicious and I am a meat lover in general. It is quite big and very filling. The sweet potatoes fries are amazing and the sauces are great. Most burgers and bratwurst are big that you don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶

40,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Had a nice experience here, food was absolutely lovely and so innovative! We got the platter and it was a great way to try a bit of everything. Decor is very cool too."
41,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,They garnish the food and make it look very pretty. Their social media works very well in supporting the business as well. It is just some vegan comfort food that is likely to taste just as good if you use the same sauces and oils at home. ‚Ä¶
42,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm not even vegan but I was interested in the hype around the culture and this place is excellent in terms of quality junk food.

45,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very very good! Me and my husband said this is one of the best burgersüëç staffs are friendly as well. We had the vegan calamari rings with bitter balls. even the texture of calamari was like the real calamari.
46,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So so good! If you ever miss food that you used to eat, this is the place to go. They even have vegan bitterballen so you can try some traditional Dutch dishes without the compromise üòâ nice selection of beers, try the fries with ""chicken ‚Ä¶"
47,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, crowded place/long waits, bad music, unconfortable seating.

48,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Queue up in the weekends. Order burgers and loaded fries, but got the Flashy Loaded instead of the normal ones. Told the waitress who tried to convince me those were the only ones they have. Turned out she didn't even know their own menu! ‚Ä¶"

Portions are HUGE. ‚Ä¶"
58,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was amazing!! We are meat eaters and were astonished by how good the vegan burgers tasted. The plant based beef was so tender and juicy. Portions are also very generous! The waffle fries were also delicious. The only thing that put us off slightly was the service.
59,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cannot recommend this place highly enough. Some of the best burgers I've had in my life, better than the majority of burgers than use real meat. The loaded fries are also fantastic and are perfect for sharing as well as other things. For ‚Ä¶"
60,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place is so hip we had to wait for almost an hour to even get in! But food didnt dissapoint! for a meat lover its surprisingly good...really fills you up and taste quite like the real thing..but i find it quite pricy especially the drinks. Will i come back? I will tag along only when my vegetarian friends go there!
61,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I really loved this place.  The name says it all.  This place specializes in vegan junk food.  We're talking burgers, loaded fries, even sushi.  Sushi doesn't really fit with that but the vegan fish they use has a great texture.  The ‚Ä¶"

63,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Terrible customer service.

Rude staff, clueless! ‚Ä¶"
64,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Wait time was insane. Very large menu which was nice but the food is nothing special. The service was fast after being seated but sadly that does not outweigh the lack of quality of the food or the wait time for a seat
65,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We stumbled into this place by accident. I‚Äôm not a vegan and occasionally enjoy junk food. The food was exactly like how they describe them - ‚ÄúVegan Junk Food‚Äù. The food was amazing! I couldn‚Äôt tell that the ‚Äúshawrawma‚Äù was not made of ‚Ä¶
66,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best burger and loaded fries & nachos ever had. A friendly atmosphere with good staff. Heaven for a vegan....simply love it..
67,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been in Amsterdam for 3 days, and came back EVERY DAY! Everything they have on the menu is just perfect. Not sure all is healthy, but as strict vegan, junk food once in a while will not kill you.. go there and try it all! Notice they have few branches in the city, and the one that in the city center has long queue of waiting..."
68,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,First time experience at a vegan restaurant. Must say it was surprisingly good! As a meat lover I can recommend this place as well. The burger ‚Äòmeat‚Äô taste like real meat and love the banana chips!
69,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good vibes, fast service, friendly staff. I would highly recommend the sweet potato fries with the truffle mayo.

72,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First experiences good; was a bit disappointed they ran out of the doggy style XL but my second choice Daddy McChickn was fairly good. The atmosphere was awesome, loved the music choice selection. Will definitely visit again when back in area"
73,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Despite being busy and there being a lot if us we were able to be seated right away. The food was lovely I was surprised at the portion sizes I didn't think they would be as big as they were. Considering it was vegan it was still very nice and would go back. The service was great and I had no complaints.
74,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Great food and super nice staffüôÇ
75,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite delicious burger. It does resemble a normal non-vegan burger but I wouldn't say the taste was extremely meaty. In other words, if you didn't know it was vegan you wouldn't know/be able to tell but you might think there are meatier burgers. All in all I enjoyed it a lot and it's a nice (vegan) option."

80,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Hands down the best fast food in Amsterdam! incredible vegan burger, delicious loaded fries all in a trendy setting. The VJFB is building up on its success and is a great home base for the vegans out there who also deserve a cheat day!"
81,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The onion rings were fantastic, but the burger was a little dry (not to mention, it was the size of my head!). I think this is a good place to go if you're looking for a novelty vegan meal in Amsterdam, or if you are visiting the city from ‚Ä¶"

85,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice junk food. Be there on time, before 6 or expect to wait 30+ minutes to be seated. The burger and loaded fries are my favorite. The vegan sashimi looked nice but tasted like nothing. Music can be quite loud. Definitely worth a visit to have a comforting vegan meal, accompanied with some (boozy) drinks and old school R&B hits"

103,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"After a long day at the Rijksmuseum this restaurant was just what we needed. Colorful, delicious, all vegan food was available that also included some Dutch and center European specialties, such as bitterballs, fries and bratwurst.
Order the loaded fries for a satisfying, filling meal :)"
104,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"I had the ""Fish and chips"" and the ""classic better balls"". In my opinion, poor quality, too much of everything in the plate and an unremarkable value for money. (driven by Instagram) I sat down with genuine enthusiasm and curiosity but it was totally delusional."
105,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Seriously delicious vegan junk food! I'm a good eater, but next time I'll only have a burger without side dishes because that burger is a lot of food.
Pricey, but worth the splurge."
106,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, good drinks. Very popular place, might be a waiting queue. Not the cheapest, but the food quality makes up for it. Vegan burgers taste pretty much like a real burger."

110,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,a month ago,The vegan bacon or meat taste just so artificial.... Burgers can taste good only with mushrooms and vegetables..
111,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food presentation is incredible and the amount of food you receive is excellent for the price. There was a lot of sauce of the food and it can get messy. Waffle fries are my personal favourite.

114,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Really overpriced. There were free tables and a long line, yet the tables remained free for almost 30 minutes while the line didn't move. Waiters walked around, saw the situation, and didn't do anything."

121,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We heard a lot of good things about this place from Friends. One mistake we made was we went after 10 and they stop serving their burgers which is what they're famous for after a certain time. we got the sampler which included a lot of the food and also got the Truffle fries which were delicious.
122,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food, nice cocktails, friendly staff and great atmosphere. Awesome music too. I had the fancy Kapsalon which was vegam shawarma and delicious and my partner had the original burger ( which is a beyond meat burger) and he he loved it ( not vegan)."
123,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This has got to be the nicest place for vegan food!!! Loved it... In fact I'd go back to Amsterdam just so I could have that burger again!!
124,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Trendy vegan restaurant, quick service & tasty food. Quite pricey, and a bit too commercial for me. People queuing out the door, which must be a good thing. Overall, worth a visit"
125,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Incredibly tasty and oh such large portions. Service was excellent and the speed of the food being presented was exceptional. Don't expect to get a seat at peak times as there will more than likely be a queue. Worth it though if you're willing to wait.
126,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"As a meat lover, the veggie burgers are sufficient to keep me satisfied - they give me the same satisfaction as beef burgers but are much lighter on the stomach. The fries with mayonnaise/ truffle is an excellent side dish. However, the ‚Ä¶"
127,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,A good place to visit for vegan food. The setup is nice and staff are friendly. The food itself is average - the ingredients concern me as there are too many e numbers and majority of the food is soy. Good for vegans but not a healthy alternative.
128,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This place has absolutely amazing food. I am not even vegan or vegetarian. Just went here to try something new. Did not expect too much. Oh was I surprised... Hands down one of the best burgers I ever had. Must visit.
129,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"When I traveled to Amsterdam, this was one of the top spots on my list to visit. It did not disappoint and I can‚Äôt wait to return!! The cheese wontons are ridiculously good and like nothing I‚Äôve ever tasted before, or since"
130,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Stumbled upon this place by accident. Super cool and hipster kind of place with really great vegan burgers (probably the best one I ever had). Very nice staff and cool music. Usually very crowded. I don't think you can book a table in ‚Ä¶

133,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"As a meat eater, the plant based burger is alright. The shwoarma burger was closer on the mark. Either way, good meal and easy choice with veggie/vegan friends."
134,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"The restaurant is ...ok. I had burger and pizza. Burger was quite nice, pizza was really small and not very tasty. Service wasn‚Äôt amazing, but ok"
135,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was very good, tasting much better (but a bit more expensive) then non vegan fast food. It was very busy and the staff was chaotic, but it is definitely worth it. Maybe not for a romantic night, but definitely good with friends"

‚ù§Ô∏è I adore it! Vegan heaven. Thanks for offering cruelty free food. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
137,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food! Had the original burger and kapsalon. Not very cheap in general, but the portions are big so it‚Äôs worth every penny. The place is a bit crowded but the service is still quite fast. Would love to go back."
138,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A place where you can get junk food and not feel guilty for eating any animal product.  Super tasty and healthy eating. A great place to have a great and share good vegan bar food.  Seaweed nuggets for the win!
139,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not vegan myself but this food is amazing. A great alternative to the usual burger restaurants, and it tastes even better.  I'd love to see this restaurant open up in the UK!"
140,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I didn‚Äôt realize there was more than one Vegan Junk Food Bar until today! This one has a more extensive menu than the first place I was in...and the Daddy McChicken is double the size of the first place! I tried the apple/celery/cucumber/spinach juice and I give it a big thumbs up! üëç
141,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My wife and I were soooooo excited to eat here from the moment on we saw it opened .... and today we‚Äòre on a trip to amsterdam so we came, saw an were ...... FREAKING AMAZED! ‚Ä¶"
142,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious vegan comfort food.  The double chicken was insanely large; I had to eat it with fork and knife.  Very delicious!
143,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,5/5 food and 5/5 service!! We recommend the no beef nachos and the ribs (if you can handle a little spice)
144,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've been here a couple times now. The food has been of high quality every time and the staff is very friendly. The food tasty, filling and looks beautiful. The place is often crowded and sometimes the music can be a little loud, which might bother some people, but it's never been a problem for me."
145,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It was my first experience with vegan bar and it was absolutely worth it. I had original burger with plant-based beef and it was absolutely delicious. I would not say it is better than normal burger, but still is perfect."
146,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best burgers ever! Vegan or not vegan, just come and try them. Sure you‚Äôll love it :)"
147,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"the food looks good but I waited a while at my table waiting for someone to take my order, I even tried going inside to order and they told me they would come to my table. I just left after 20 min of waiting"
148,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Was brought here by a Dutch vegan while visiting the city and LOVED it. I try to eat vegan as much as possible, but have also had meat burgers. Let me say that the burger I had here was potentially the best burger i‚Äôve EVER had. Deserves the hype it‚Äôs getting. Moderate pricing but totally worth it."
149,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,a month ago,"Food is good, but please stop working with Thuisbezorgd - terrible app and service, while my order was processed for 45 min, it got cancelled 9min before delivery"
150,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Vegan junk food in perfection! üëç A feast for the tastebuds as well as for the eyes! Taste and especially presentation of the food are on point and in summer you can even sit outside! üòã So if you are looking for THE best vegan junk food ‚Ä¶
151,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,6 months ago,They've got great food but the prices are crazy high. Guess that's to be expected in the area it's located in. They only take card payments so keep that in mind. Great atmosphere for group hangouts but it will be a hassle if you all want to pay separately.
152,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,We went there twice! The food was sooo good and you got great quality compared to what you had to pay. Would definitely go again.
153,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Not a vegan and still thought this place was great. The faux meat is very flavorful and the texture was surprisingly good. Decent beer and cocktail selection. Prices are fair.
154,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A friend of mine (we're from France) told us about the VJFB and we were not disappointed! The staff was very agreable. This is a very nice place. The food was very good, we'll definitely come back !"
155,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,4 months ago,The intention is great. There's much more hype ü§ë than taste and portion size though. However there's potential to be better

157,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"You could do with a reservation, to be seated inside. But the staff is great and will call you while your having a drink somewhere else, as soon as a table is available."
158,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful presentation! Food was very good as well. Not over priced for a vegan restaurant. Very in line with other vegan places in a big city.

170,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great snack food; 4 stars. However the service was quite bad. The staff was very passive aggressive,  generally rude and inconsiderate towards all customers. I'd rather not go again. Other vegan junk food bars are friendlier and welcoming."

175,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I ate the best burger I ever had here! We had to wait an hour for a spot, but it was s√≥ worth the wait. We started off with nacho crisps with loads of guac and salsa, then we had the vjfb burgers which were absolutely amazing, didn't even ‚Ä¶"
176,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The portions are very generous. Absolutely delicious. Sat here in a good coma I may never be able to leave. The mc chicken was better than the sumo in my opinion. But great hearty dirty food!!
177,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Note for tourists - this restaurant does not accept cash or American Express, but they do take Visa and MasterCard. We had the tipsy unicorn, waffle fries, regular fries, falafel bitten balls, the sumo, and the chicken sandwich. All were incredible!"

Impressive work, guys!"
186,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice dishes, mainly around the burger... Although usually I don't like food that trys to be something it's not, that was good and the sweet potato fries always a win + draft beer... What else do you nee?!
Kind stuff and overall I enjoyed the atmosphere in a half sunny day"

192,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The idea is great. And the food looks perfect for instagram. But there is soo much sauce on each of the dishes. The original burger was still good tough:)

194,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Not great. Very overpriced, mediocre ""dishes"". The flavors are not very developed and taste like soy. The marketing graphics are high school level, and some of the wait staff are not very capable. I will not be coming back."
195,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The beginning of a new succes. Vegan is hot and this place knows that. Combination of Vegan food and fast. Not that logical as vegan goes better together with slow. But marketing wise its a perfect match. The food is okay and there is ‚Ä¶

285,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"This vegan junk food bar is better than the one in rokin centre, was seated and served quickly, nice atmosphere. Unfortunately everything I wanted to order they didn't have so ended up having to order something else which was disappointing. Food was nice, good portion sizes."

289,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very tasty vegan food! The hotdog closely resembles the original in taste, and the burger to a lesser extent. Fries and sauces are super good.

291,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious food! Kind staff! Great vibe!

334,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A great venue for vegan food. Lively atmosphere with friendly and helpful staff. The food although not cheap was very good with generous portions. I'm not a veggie but really didn't miss meat. Definitely worth a visit if you are in 'dam.

393,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love the Kapsalon and the burgers! The food is really good and good price/quality, best veggie/vegan junkfood that we had. Also the staff is superfriendly and made it as comfortable as possible for us with our baby and big stroller. Can't wait for the Oost location to open:)"
394,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best food. Try the sumo platter for a taste of veganized bitter balls. Burgers are delicious, highly recommend the mc chickn burger. It's all good, vegan beer from two chefs is a win too."

396,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic burgers and service. Music may be a little loud for some.
397,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is so good here! It tastes a little too much like real meat of you ask me üòÇ I personally recommend the Amsterdam bitterballen & the sweet potato fries, they're delicious. But please don't forget to make a reservation, the place is really populair and the waiting time is sometimes pretty long.."
398,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm amazed with the quality and tastefulness of the food. As a hardcore meat-eater I was sceptical but boy, was I in for a big surprise. Vegan Bitterballen, wow. Notorious Sumo, even better. Will go here more often, and will bring my meat-loving friends! :)"
399,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food is really really good but the service is really really bad. We came in and there weren‚Äôt any tables so they told us to wait approx 20 minutes but they couldn‚Äôt put us on the list so we have to wait but we could not wait inside because ‚Ä¶
400,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They advertise a no-reservation policy on the website, but when we got here all tables were reserved (so 75% of the place was empty) and there was a wait list of 1h30m! Disappointing because I was looking forward to the good food they are ‚Ä¶"
401,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has by far the best vegan junk food I've ever eaten! I've been all over the world and I dream of the food here every day! Highly recommended if you're in Amsterdam. Coffee shop then Vegan Junk Food Bar, you won't regret it üòé"
402,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Great as always, if you have never tried VJFB you are in for a treat. Nobody on this planet should be disappointed by their food"

405,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very lovely restaurant! If you are interested in trying out super tasty vegan food, definitly check this place out. They all spea English only which is a little weird for a Dutch restaurant, but awh well. I would recommend to make a ‚Ä¶"
406,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Omg yum!!!! So great!!! Update: still really Great
407,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Come here for the greasy vegan food, (tasty and good buns) and you won't be disappointed. Music is a bit too loud for my taste, and what they call spicy is just nicely seasoned in my opinion."
408,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"As a non vegan, I really enjoyed the food here. Original place that serves great food.
Really fill my tummy. Definitely would come another time!"
409,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Well, I have been at both locations...the one in amsterdam west was better then the one in the Pijp. I understand the concept of junk vegan but it should still be of high standard and it can be! My meal was a disgrace, I ordered the ‚Ä¶"

411,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Gigantic portions at a reasonable price.

It may be called ""junk"" but the taste was everything but junk! It was very tasty ‚Ä¶"
412,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It was good but not as remarkable as other reviews made it sound. I had the burger and it was served a little cold. I'm not sure if that is how it's supposed to be served or what. The ambiance was really cool and the service was better than what most people have been saying.
413,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Walked 10 minutes from Paradiso to get a vegan shoarma, and while open till midnight, they only serve french fries after 11pm.. big letdown. Why even stay open then? Fries are always vegan, you can get them everywhere."
414,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I fell in love with VJFB!
Really liked every single menu I've tried."
415,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing place best food  I have ever tasted
416,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Regardless the poor welcoming due to an incompetant waiter (we had to wait 30 minutes whilst many seats were available), burgers, sides and cocktails tasted delicious ! ‚Ä¶"
417,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious vegan Food. I don't know how they do it, but the Chicken Burger and the mozarella sticks really tasted like the real thing. Didn't really like the atmosphere but thats a matter of taste. Frindly staff. Pricey, but that seems to be the case in the whole city of Amsterdam."
418,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I am not a vegan or vegetarian and this place was one of the best food experiences I had. It all tastes exactly like meat and the quality is amazing! A must go.
419,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I can't speak to the food because I waited up front for almost 10 mins and was never seated. A spilled drink sat in the middle of the floor while customers tried to maneuver around it. They seem severely understaffed and the staff they have need more training. Too bad. Was looking forward to trying the food.
420,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food. Service as well but depends on who is serving you. ‚úå
421,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cool place and tasty.
422,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Brilliant service and food, decent prices for quality of food and location. ‚Ç¨10-11 for a burger which is reasonable for Amsterdam, vegan, and in a lovely location. Desert options aren't great though - the only downfall! I went on a Saturday ‚Ä¶"
423,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, it is a bit on the expensive side, but to get a full vegan junk food meal you have to go here. No healthy options, but to gorge on delicious types of fries, with custom made sauce and a huge burger... sometimes you just have to ‚Ä¶"

425,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Good vegan food but terrible waitress
426,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best vegan place ever! amazing burgers and all the rest... could go there every day. Now as a proper restaurant even better than the one at Vondelpark. super friendly staff and great atmosphere.
427,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Surprisingly tasty burgers, great staff. Always full though, so arrive early or prepare to wait! Bookings are only taken on Mon-Thurs for groups, but definitely worth the wait!"
428,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fast, friendly, trendy and delicious"
429,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very busy place but the food was good. There was quite a lot of wait but we liked it. A bit pricey for what it is: burgers were not extraordinary
430,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very low quality, very high prices. A simple burger costs 11 euros and worths 6. The bread looks like a cheap one from Dirk."
431,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This olace is amazing. They have a great variety of options to choose from and everything we had was simply delicious. I would say that even the most enthusiastic carnivore would not be able to deny that the food is super yummy
432,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The burger is absolutely delicious and their signature sause is to die for!! Not a big fan of the macha tea tho but the service over all was quick! One thing you should know is that they don't accept cash..cards only!
433,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is literally the best. Service at our (9 person) table was a bit lacking. With us having to ask for drinks multiple times and no one really being very attentive, but the place was packed and the food...oh man the food."
434,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Great food and friendly staff! We love coming here once in a while.
435,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They had a ""kitchen stop"" in the middle of lunchtime, taking no orders. They said 15 min but we left after 40 min with no food. It wasn't even that busy. Prices are very high. Staff didn't really care and were just hanging around doing nothing."
436,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Music bit loud, but I guess it's part of the atmosphere and attitude. Awesome food, will come back!"
437,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful staff. Food is OK, tasty but nothing special, way way overpriced. Juice was good but a small glass for 4.75. Creepy that cash is not accepted but only electronic payments. Big brother is watching."
438,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food is good but I think Its way too expensive for what you get. Well typical Amsterdam prices. Otherwiese yes it is vegan Junkfood also really good one but the prices are too high and the service is a bit lala. Thats why I give 3 stars
439,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, recommended even to meat lovers ;-)"
440,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, really one of the best burgers and kapsalon we've ever had. But the service was impersonal, the music loud and the food a little pricey. But the food, amazing."

448,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good pseudomeat dishes. Had the chicken burger the first time I went there.  Fantastic.  Shawarma the second time.  Fantastic.  Would totally pass as meat if I not been aware the food was vegan.
449,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Such nice place
450,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing food. Best vegan food in Amsterdam.

453,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was fine, I don‚Äôt know what happened when I ordered fries there weren‚Äôt hot, there were just a bit warm, there had cheese and it was. It hot too, just a warm, so
I couldn‚Äôt enjoyed them"
454,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I'm not vegan myself but my partner is and the food here was fantastic. Would give it 5 stars but they only take card here and no cash which is a pain if you're a tourist
455,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, but understaffed with a kitchen that is too small to serve the amount of customers they can seat. As a result, the service can be be less than optimal. This is on busy nights, though, so please judge for yourself. If there's a line outside, you know what to expect."
456,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty much just incredible. Everything we ate blew us away, from the sashimi, to the bacon, to the chicken burger.. you could not get closer to the real product. The future of food is here."
457,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I'm not vegan but the food was awesome! I really enjoyed the place. The only issue is the waiting times. It can take a while for you food to come.
458,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good. And opens early too. Surprisingly busy on a Sunday but we've visited here twice and both times were good. Food was great!
459,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious!! You need to like hip hop music.
460,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I stumbled on this place with my non-vegan family. Friendly staff, great music, and my family was amazed that they couldn't tell it apart from meat. Best burgers and fries."
461,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"So lovely to be in a restaurant where I can eat everything! Got the loaded nachos and needed help to finish. The art is fun, music is cool, and staff are friendly and prompt."
462,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really, really good vegan food. Staff super friendly! Might be a good idea to check if you can book in advance cause it seems to be a busy spot"

464,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Love the concept, junk vegan food, it looked great and yeah, at least my order left me feeling like I would feel after eating junk food, heavy and dissapointed hehe I would have expected being a vegan meal to have a lighter feeling but I would go back and try something different eventually."
465,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food. Vegan food so tasty,  you will never think of eating non veg.

Well done VJFB for saving animals and giving great taste."

471,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It does what it says on the tag. If you want vegan junkfood this is the place! If you have gotten used to eating healthy the big burgers might feel like a bit too much though.

473,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,You don‚Äôt have to be a vegan to love this junk food!
474,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Surprisingly good vegan dishes even for meat eaters, but it's not the cheapest. 12 EUR for a big amazing tasty burger w/o fries."
475,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best vegan burger in town is the notorious sumo burger. They also have very good snacks and everything is vegan of course. Great place, nice staff and quick service"
476,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is the kind of food that will make you go vegan if you're not (which I'm not! ). I didn't feel like any ingredient was missing or that the taste was lacking. It is scrumptious and I wish I lived here so I could eat it all the time.
477,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, fresh, clever menu items well prepared, fast attentive service... that it was vegan didn‚Äôt matter, it just tasted good."

479,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Amazing ambiance. Must visit
480,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"niiiiceee food, love everything here. but it's expensive..."
481,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good alternative for meat lovers looking for alternative to eating meat but still crave the texture and taste. If you are a vegetarian that hates the taste of flesh then this might not be the best option as menu is mainly made from oumph which is not to every vegetarian's taste.
482,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, lovely food and most importantly:  vegan.
It‚Äôs usually crowded so go with time in case you‚Äôve to wait a bit to get a table."

484,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very tasty food served fast
485,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Personnel is not very experienced but nice, and the food is delicious"
486,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Extremely disappointing. Relatively expensive and the food was just for the most part gross. Way too many condiments but strangely enough there really wasn't much flavour. Your money is definitely better spent elsewhere
487,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is too easy. Amazing food!
488,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The service here is really bad. 2 stars because of the food. They spilled beer on us and didn‚Äôt even apologize or offer to clean up. We had to ask for water multiple times and even then they took it to the wrong table.
489,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"great location, delicious food and nice service"
490,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Bit in limbo over this one. Summup: great staff, too noisy music, food looks and tastes great - but ur bowels dont like so many fake ingredients in 1 dish. Food & drinks both overpriced. 50 euro for 2p anytime üòî"
491,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Extra Large portions of mediocre vegan food. If the place full, be prepared to wait 45 minutes from the time you order. If you're not vegan, don't bother. If you're, not worth it."
492,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I hate this place and the idea. Had a burger there for dinner: is insanely busy, not good service and I don't get why if you go vegan you should like junk food?! ü§î"
493,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good vegan food . A little crowded And noisy. Not a big fan of some of the dish but burgers and fries are good . A little pricey but overall a good experience...

496,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really amazing food.  Smells kinda greasy inside so sit outside if you can. The burgers are to die for, as is the truffle sauce."
497,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The food is delicious but unfortunately it's less enjoyable because of the loud music which is purely mainstream! Could be at least a lot lower for the customers who'd like to eat in peace ‚úåÔ∏è
498,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Lousiest service I‚Äôve experienced in years. The place was full of customers either waiting to order or waiting to pay - most tables were empty. Three waiters walked around like they couldn‚Äôt have cared less.
499,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. The food was very nice and the was lots of it! The notorious sumo burger is about half a foot tall üòã

No matter how full the place is service is always mediocre bordering on bad."

503,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really great food, well served dishes! One of the best  Vegetarian/vegan restaurants if you are looking for junk food!"
504,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Only dish I think is worth paying is the Kapsalon. Staff can do with a customer service training. One waiter need to assist customers rather than parading around and ignoring you.
505,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, amazing food (all vegan) and very friendly staff. I go there whenever I can and would absolutely recommend it!"
506,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Surpringly tasty food. One stop place for harxore veggies and non-veggies to agree on for lunch or dinners. Sadly it's extremely busy and can be waiting for long hrs for table. Early birds flock happily

510,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,100 marks for the idea and the food coloring. People visiting Amsterdam should not miss it. Even if you are a non veg it is a must. Experience yourself
511,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Exactly what it says on the tin. Vegan dirties everywhere. What a full circle we have come. Vegan places making mock fast food. One day we will long for tofu again.
512,Vegan Junk Food Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful food and drinks, friendly atmosphere, just one annoying pigeon creeping in and showing off its feathered meat. Do bring some dope, quality has a price!!"
