133,Marhaba, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great service.  Professional and courteous.
134,Marhaba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The marhaba employees were really helpful.. Just be aware of the services under each pack.. I booked the silver pack last month for my parents.. And they were escorted right from the arrival gate..quick and comfortable..
135,Marhaba, 1 star ,a year ago,Horrible service. Trying to get an answer to my service request for over 6 days now. the call center agents are rude and not properly trained. They promise an answer but with no avail. Very frustrating.
136,Marhaba, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible service, clueless call center staff, and a lot of confusion and frustration at the very last minute before the flight. Irresponsible and rude staff. Such a negative and poor service surprisingly in a great city like Dubai."
137,Marhaba, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Marhaba is great service either for individuals or family. They will help you until you reach gates depends on your service you can enjoy relaxing at Marhaba lounge with variety of food and drinks or chauffeur service.
138,Marhaba, 1 star ,a year ago,"thank you for being the worst call center experience ever..
dont have the option of ZERO STAR hence posting as 1STAR …"
139,Marhaba, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Good service if you are in a hurry and have children with you. I use it when I come to Dubai but not when I am leaving, the lounge is usually crowded with people, you will be lucky to find a seat"
140,Marhaba, 1 star ,3 years ago,I used the service for my wife and kid. Even after seeing negative reviews I went for it as I trusted Dubai. But my experience was worst. I have contact them and had to shout at them to get things done. They lack professionalism.
141,Marhaba, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Horrible service , we paid and we got nothing , the staff didn’t give any attention nor help in anytime in comparisons to the description on the website"
142,Marhaba, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Sadly, am very disappointed. They never communicated to confirm the booking. I discovered the dates were incorrect the day before I could travel. They thrn said I did not show up. Very annoyed and disappointed!"
143,Marhaba, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Its not the same Mahrba lounge it used to be, poor location, overcrowded people. worst maintained bathrooms ... what else, i think they changed the location due to renovation or something... but if they provide such low  location, they should have reduced the price."
144,Marhaba, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent place to relax on a busy airport. Good variety of vegetarian food as well as beverages. Toilets are clean and adequate in number.  Comfortable sofas.
145,Marhaba, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Crowded, worn out and almost all food was gone. Coffee was from a machine was not very nice. Showers are extra and waiting times is long. Rather go to hotel sports club and pay to use theirs."
146,Marhaba, 1 star ,a year ago,"Worse experience ,you will not get anything you wanted or what you paid for ...
And they take ages to solve the dispute ..
Spend money on this service at your own risk ..."
