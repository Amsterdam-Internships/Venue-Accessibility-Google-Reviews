4,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"A smashing little cafe bar on the corner where Prinsengracht and Brouwersgracht meet. Very picturesque inside. The landlord his a good sense of humour. When I arrived I asked for (in my poor Dutch) 2 Heinekens. He said he sells beer, not Heineken!"

Typical Amsterdam local place."
6,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This small yet beautiful place was really cozy and warm, a classic brown bar in Amsterdam.  We sat at the bar and had beers and apple pie.  The pie must be very popular as it was still warm when served. We also saw another two pies just ‚Ä¶"
7,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Charming, very old ""brown"" bar built in the 1640's. The vibe is very chill and relaxing.  They do not play music which honestly was a wonderful change. You could actually talk! They served Amstel out of a beautifully ornate 100+ year old ‚Ä¶"

12,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Walked in off the street for a quick coffee and to check out this place. Was pretty standard however I had to notice that the building was very tastefully decorated, take a look at the photos that I uploaded with this review.

14,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We found this place by chance, a local suggested it over a beer. He said ""they have the best apple pie in the world"" so why not try it? Well if you're wondering, he was right!! It was airy, not too sweet, fresh. Perfection. Also it was a huge serving! I completed coming back to Amsterdam just for some more pie."
15,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Typical Dutch bar, full.of locals and the real Dutch experience.  Can get busy especially on a Saturday after the market but it's also more Gezellig as the locals would say."

48,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The apple pie is pretty good, not too sweet, very traditional looking. Service is very basic, not very welcoming. Owner is easily irritable, but very nice to locals. It is a very small place with huge tables sitting 6 to 8. So don‚Äôt expect to get a table.

60,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The neighborhood for Het Papeneiland is so quiet at night but this little bar is full of life! We ended up here on our way to Vesper and it was a great stop for a beer. The doorway is narrow but the interior has a good amount of space. The ‚Ä¶
61,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful service and a beautiful interior. I had a well rounded trip with a slice of apple pie, an espresso, and two Amstels. As a solo traveller it was a great place to sit and listen as the locals came in and out around the end of the business day."
62,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best Applepie I've ever eaten. And jeah... Second day we went there and the bartender knew what we where after, thats just service on Point! ‚Ä¶"
63,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really cool bar. Upstairs was a smoking room but no one was up there so we took advantage...we don't smoke. Old, cool, and awesome spot. A local guided us here. Told us it was one of the oldest pubs, if not the oldest in Amsterdam."

65,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My son and I went here late at night to try the famous apple pie that Bill Clinton had.  Pie was amazing as were the locals and the bar owner.  Had such a good time hanging out and talking about the world.  The eclectic bar is one of those ‚Ä¶

68,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Beautiful brown pub in the Jordaan. So much character in such a lovely place! It is relatively roomy inside and they do encourage you to share a table with other people. Very friendly hosts. ‚Ä¶
69,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We were amazed by how beautiful & homey the interior of this place is! We passed by a few times previously, but it was too packed to get in, but we were very happy to visit it on a less-busy day! Very friendly staff, place seems like a warm ‚Ä¶"
70,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This charming little bar is a great place to grab a drink when walking around Jordaan. The interior is cozy and decorated with old photos and delftblue tiles. The bar tenders were some of the friendliest we encountered on this this trip. They have a decent selection of local beers and apple pie!
71,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 1 star ,2 years ago,"What could have been a nice place is ruined in its entirety by the staff behind the bar. When I tried to play chess with a friend, we were shown the door because games aren't allowed. They then put on the Ajax game so I guess some games are ‚Ä¶"

73,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,A lovely Pub in a quaint little corner of Amsterdam. Really nice Barman and a rustic interior really made us feel like we'd gone back to Old Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶
74,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This place is an institution. Some bruin cafes in Amsterdam feel a little impenetrable and the regulars can make you feel out of place. But everyone at Het Papeneiland is always warm and friendly and the service is fast. Don‚Äôt forget to take a slice of apple cake when you visit :)
75,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a real shame that five stars is the maximum rating as this place deserves more! Staff are incredibly friendly, the coffee is great and the Apple pie WONDERFUL! The establishment is FULL of character! Inside seating on two levels and ‚Ä¶"

79,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 1 star ,2 years ago,My husband and I spend a week in Amsterdam with nothing but pleasant experiences until we stopped here for coffee and beer. The bartender was horrible. Simply horrible. We were extremely uncomfortable and confused by his behavior. This man ‚Ä¶

81,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The best apple pie in Amsterdam ‚ù§
82,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place for a cappuccino and a piece of Apple pie. Cozy atmosphere and the staff is really nice. Too bad the apple pie is not warmer, that would give it a 5th star!"
83,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My favourite pub in the world thus far.....have being back here every couple of years for the last 15 yrs. Family owned place.... The staff are so friendly. The apple pie is an old family recipe and it's AMAZING!!!
84,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This pub was recommended on the KLM in-flight magazine, but it really doesn't deserve this accolade...we perceived a lack of atmosphere and the barman was curt and did not make us feel welcome as tourists. The facility does however live up to the typical brown cafe decor."
85,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best Cheese cake I have ever eaten. I didn‚Äôt know Hat Papeneiland was famous for it. I just walked inside and saw the cake. That‚Äôs when I thought I had to eat it no matter what. It was completely worth it. üòã
86,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This place is known for their apple pie. And it is indeed a good one, although probably not the best I've had in Amsterdam. Coffee is so-so. Still, nice place to eat an apple pie and watch the canals."
87,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"For my taste, best apple pie with cream we tried in Amsterdam. Good beer selection, friendly service, all you can hope for from a brown cafe."
88,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I liked the location. Prices are low compared to other sites. Place is small.
You can‚Äôt drink and work with your pc or tablet cause the bartender says it‚Äôs not a Internet cafe. ‚Ä¶"
89,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 3 stars ,5 years ago,cool little bar for a drink but do not eat here! I heard rave reviews about the Apple pie... it's terrible. it even looked bad but I thought I would give it a shot.  Also had a beef sandwich of some sort which was 4 pieces of microwaved meat on a bun and a mustard packet on the side!
90,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Went here on the recommendation of a bartender at Mats Hari (another great bar) and was really glad we did.  This is an extremely small neighborhood bar that is a great spot to grab a beer.  If you can, grab one of the seats outside for some great people watching"
91,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My favourite place in Amsterdam. Beautiful location right by the canal. Staff are very friendly and funny. The deco is traditionally Dutch and the prices are very very reasonable. Sit outside on the top and watch the world go by. Upstairs is super cosy and will be great when it gets cold. Check it out!!
92,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Extraordinary Apple Pie. Must try. Friendly staff. Was part of the Eating Europe Food Tour in the Jordaan Quarter also to be recommended as well.
93,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Too busy on the street. Cars, vans, lorries continuously passing.
Strong smell from a fishmonger nearby."
94,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very unpleasant experience. I do belive that this caf√© doesn't comply with the requirements of hygiene and  the food - handling standards. In fact, my experience was terrible becouse my apple cake had a hair. Thinking that it was an ‚Ä¶"

96,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best apple pie. The owner was super nice, but the next day I came back and someone else was there. He was not as nice. The slice of pie was much smaller. He called me stupid. If the owners there five stars. If he isn't, three stars."
97,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A beautiful original little cafe/bar. The food is very good (I would highly recommend the apple pie) and staff are friendly. Will definitely be back.
98,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice, very atmospheric place to relax with a drink in one of Amsterdam's most charming neighborhoods. The building itself is basically a cute Dutch stereotype (the house on the corner in the photo)"
99,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiful place, you can notice it since you arrive, I love the decoration of this place, really good job. They have a great service and a lot of kinds of beers, also they have a really good service. I will recommend have a drink here, you will love the place and love the people in there"
100,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"An experience. From the moment you walk in you know you are in a very vintage place. In fact, Papeneiland is one of the oldest bars in Amsterdam, dating back to 1642. The beers there are good, and the upstairs area is very cozy to hang out in a group of 5 people or so."
101,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"As an American, I was welcomed and reminded-lest I forget-that President Bill Clinton visited the very establishment in a tour of Amsterdam in his term. I was also welcomed by the prices, the staff, the local preference of sandwich, and the ‚Ä¶"
102,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice yet small cafe next to the bridge.
Lots of locals there. Upstairs is a large smoking area and outside a small terrace with a great view over the canals. Always a nice to sit and watch the bicycles pass by."
103,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Extremely rude staff. Asked for a couple glasses of water with a coke and a beer and they refused saying ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt work like that, we sell drinks only‚Äô. Arrogant, rude staff. And bald (but that‚Äôs not their fault) just terrible genetics."
104,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Had a great little experience here as part of an Eating Amsterdam food tour. A sliver of famous apple pie and a coffee to start the day right. The cafe dates back to the 1640s and is in the Jordaan Neighbourhood.
105,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place! neighborhood pub you'd love
106,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Gorgeous brown caf√© with one of those witty Amsterdammers in the bar. Atmosphere alone would've given this five stars, but I was a bit put off by beer prices and there wasn't enough cinnamon on the apple pie."
107,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Absolutely love this cafe!!! So welcoming, cosy, and authentic. Delightful apple tart and cream. Such a nice place to visit and great prices"
108,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, really nice owners and staff. Amazing apple pie that's homemade. Recommend coming here."
109,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's been a while since I went; 2014 during the World Cup, but I remember how nice they were to me and gave me a fuzzy Hup Hup Hamster, knowing I was an American.  Really chill place with a neat upstairs room to lounge and get a cool 2nd ‚Ä¶"

112,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Stopped in for a few beers on our last night. Full of locals, friendly staff. Will visit again."
113,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I ordered ginger tea in this bar, and the person working told me that I should order beer instead, and the tea I should just drink on the couch at home. This was told in not very friendly way and I didn't feel myself welcome"
114,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Mooi bruin bar. Staff are friendly as are the patrons. Good bottled beer selection as well as a modest local brewery selection on tap.
115,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pleasant relaxed atmosphere near the canals. Very interesting traditional food (kind of tartar for the breakfast, delicious apple pie /cake...)"
116,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Cozy, quiet place‚Äî at least when we visited! Apple pie is (as stated in reviews) excellent. Would happily go back when in the area."
117,Caf√© 't Papeneiland, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This cafe has a secret tunnel that helped the Catholics during 17th century to scape from a secret church next to the canal. Catholics curves were forbidden for a while so, little historical spot, great place, very small, good beers, traditional Dutch amenities, bitterballen, appeltaart, etc. A must to in Amsterdam"
