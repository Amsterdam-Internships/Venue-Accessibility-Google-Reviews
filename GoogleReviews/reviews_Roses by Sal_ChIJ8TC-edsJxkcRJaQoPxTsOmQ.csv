1,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Reading the reviews here you already go in with high expectations. I can easily say they were all surpassed for me. Top quality service and food! A bit loud because of the acoustics of the place and you might need to speak a bit louder for conversation but nobody will be talking much once the food arrives. Will come again!

9,Roses by Sal, 2 stars ,2 months ago,"I just ate the worst spareribs. Normally I love their foods but I will never order ribs again. It was really uncooked and cheavy.

146,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful food. Service leaves to be desired for more (sad). Cocktails took a really long time, and main course dishes arrived within at least a 20 minute interval of one another. Tip: you're not allowed to open the windows, and the bar prefers credit cards."
147,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The hipster sommelier / chef who entertains and gives suggestions to the guests rocks! Knowledgeable, prepared and fun.
Great selection of wines and cocktails. …"
148,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A meat-eaters paradise. Our beef tenderloin was cooked just as we had ordered and the variety of starters and sides that the six of us shared we're all delicious. We had a fun time getting together with friends there.
149,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Tasty food and Good service...you may also try the cocktails.
150,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,a year ago,I've never heard a bad review from my friends and it didn't disappoint. Gorgeous ceviche and a sizzling pulpo made my night. The waiting staff are passionate about their work and super friendly.
151,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there on Saturday evening. The place was quite busy and noisy. We tried Lechon (pig meat) but it wasn't so great, quite heavy actually. The Octapus was really nice though. White Sangria was great. The service was nice and relatively fast."
152,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best meat and restaurant staff in Amsterdam. Hands down.
153,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Probably the best restaurant I’ve ever been to in my life. Atmosphere and decor is great, music is cool (Hendrix came on), food is amazing, service both food and drinks was top level, price was more than fair."
154,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really great food here, loved the vinegar sauce that went well with the meats. Some of the starters (like the octopus) was fantastic too. After having visited some mediocre restaurants here (I'm still new to Amsterdam), I'm pleasantly …"
155,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great food and great service. I'm definitly going back
156,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best steaks I've ever had in my life; it was undercooked and was sent back but when it returned, perfection. Otherwise great food but inexperienced and mixed service. They seemed more interested in spraying empty tables with Windex right next us than clearing empty plates and glasses."
157,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is one of our favorite places to take out-of-town guests, since the atmosphere is always lively and the food fantastic.  In those situations we order a bunch of different dishes and share for the crowd.  I love the namesake salmuera …"
158,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had a very nice time there. Cost atmosphere and delicious food and very reasonable prices.
159,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food. Good service and nice people.
160,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Good food, even better cocktails and very friendly staff 👌
The day I was there was extremely loud and noisy so it was a challenge to talk on your own table."
161,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. They have some amazing traditional Mexican dishes, the staff is very friendly & professional and the interior is very nice. Highly recommended if you're looking for some excellent traditional Mexican food!"
162,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and nice location. At first we had some big doubts as our food took a very very long time to arrive, but the manager came to us to excuse for it and offered us a free cocktail for all four and a bottle of red wine. As the food was really great and with this gesture you know in any case you will have a great night here"
163,Roses by Sal, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The staff were very attentive and the starter of chicken wings with a mole glaze was great. The roof leaked on our table, the large beers were half pints and my medium steak was very rare. Would have sent it back but had waited over an hour for it. Did get two rounds of beers free, and the staff as I said were really nice."
164,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just spent 20+ min on google maps trying to find this place. I visited in September and had forgotten the name.
Got here late, shortly before the kitchen closed. The sever was very nice, sat …"
165,Roses by Sal, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Despite having been recommended by a friend, I had a bad experience a month ago. While smiling and solicit staff, the service was bad. The 2 times I ordered a beer, it took ages to arrive. The second time, nothing less than 4 times in the …"
166,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place has such delicious authentic Latin American dishes, would highly recommend. Personally love the empanadas, quesadillas, the bean/chorizo dip, dulce de leche... lots to like. And during this lockdown, they even deliver!! Go get some now!"
167,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We were recommended this place at a local bar. It's best if you book because even though it is quite a big restaurant it gets very busy. The menu is really good - focused on the meat which is really amazing quality and grilled perfectly. …
168,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious Latin American food & drinks! Mainly Argentinian, but you can also find Peruvian and Mexican dishes. Mendoza empanadas are a must. The Peruvian ceviche with ají was delicious: fresh, spicy and full of flavor. Lechón, their …"

The restaurant gives you the atmosphere of a latin place, with nice decorations, …"
170,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The four of us went for dinner and were seated right away with menus. We all decided on pastas (Pasta cooked with vodka, fettuccine with flakes of smoked salmon, and gnocchi with peas) and one of us got baked salmon (which also came with …"
171,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really nice option. Great food, service and decoration. Be prepared of body and spirit to expend quite a bit though. Want to impress someone? This is the place."
172,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good meat and fish. Service quite fast. Only miss AC when warm temperature! Our group of 14 people were placed next to the kitchen at first. Knowing that free tables were available upstairs next to the windows. Still recommend it!!!
173,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good place to go for Latin food. The ceviche is pretty small so you couldn't eat as a main dish. The drinks are good and beer is cold. Inside could be very dark even during the day so make sure to get a table outside during summertime.
174,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Awesome food, I've tried chicken and lechon, both perfect. The wine is quite acceptable. Staff super friendly and happy so you really enjoy your dinner. The place is a bit dark but I guess is part of the decoration."
175,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is my go to place for dinner. I've never had a bad experience here. The staff are attentive without being intrusive. The food is always of a great standard and the cocktails are strong! A great courtyard outside to enjoy in the warm weather and a cosy interior for when it's cold.
176,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great outdoor area, fast service, an amazing range of cocktails and a wide selection of south American style food: ceviches, street food, dipping sauces, roasted meats and steaks. Our ribeye was good but the bife lomo arrived cold."
177,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great ambiance, food was delicious (really recommend the suckling pig). Minor issue with the dinner and they threw in desserts and coffee. Great staff that know how to take care of their customers. Big thanks to Otti. Will be back."
178,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice hip atmosphere but extremely dark and loud-very difficult to talk.
The food was okey, I liked the starters (empanadas), however the main courses were disappointing: my octopus was overcooked and chewy and my partner's braised …"
179,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Honestly a sublime and unexpected Latin-experience. Such a nice and tropical ambiance and very fun young staff. I now understand why the locals go crazy about the meat specialties and insist on going there. Especially worth mentioning are …
180,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The decorations and the food itself is worth five stars, however, the service is very slow and unreliable. We were a group of four people, and at first they mixed up our starter and gave us something we never ordered. They pretty much said …"
181,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely one of my favourite places in Amsterdam. Of course, the meat is amazing (so smokey!), but I think I come back for the ceviche. Also, amazing original cocktails (ever had arugula in your drink? Because you should!)."
182,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice food with a lovely terrace, service could be a bit more attentive, dishes are well presented and prices are reasonable"
183,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Fantastic Steak and Cocktails. They really put in the work to make your dinner special.
184,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Perfectly cooked steak and smoked pork. Tasty sides of grilled veggies and potatoes. Reasonable prices. About $18-20 for each meat. $5-7 for the sides. We sat at the bar and watching the bartender was quite the show.
185,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The food is great but it's way too loud. They have this home made sauce made of a mixture of herbs and garlic and boiled water that goes great with Steak. It's apparently invented by the owner's dad and the restaurant is named after that sauce.
186,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent place if you are looking to enjoy some good meat!
187,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Hidden from view at Rozengracht 106 there's a patio in front of a beautiful building that houses this restaurant. While Argentinean, they serve food from the South American continent. Nice cocktails (including pisco sour), nice finger food, …"
188,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Excellent ambiance, service and steaks"
189,Roses by Sal, 2 stars ,6 years ago,The food is great but on a Saturday the service is slllloooooowwwwww. 9:30pm booking - start eating after 11:15pm... Finish up after midnight. …
190,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was delicious! You need to cope with a packed place with lots of noise from other table. We lived the atmosphere, the service, their recommendations on dishes and the food. We will go back for sure!"
191,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the food and the ambianc e at this restaurant. One of my favourites here in AMsterdam. When I fancy a good good steak thats the place I go.

200,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"No doubt the food is excellent.

201,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent restaurant. Food is simple but delicious. Order the ceviche , the meat or the lecheon you will not be disappointed.
Service is excellent, nice and warm :)
My go to place in Amsterdam!"
202,Roses by Sal, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good food, with great asador and tender steaks. Service absolutely the worst, waiters could care less and take no ownership for drink or food orders. Nice atmosphere overall, but with the continues poor service and inattentive waiters, 2 stars is on the high side of the review."
203,Roses by Sal, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Be careful with the 8hrs roasted pork, it is unbelievably salty. I could barely chew it."
204,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great food... Good prices
205,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"We had an amazing meal with delicious wine and five star dishes. presentation was superb and the wait staff were both helpful and friendly. The price while not the cheapest, was very reasonable for the quality of the food. definitely recommended."
206,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing. Food, ambiance, service, everything is just perfect. It's absolutely my favourite restaurant in the entire country, not even just in Amsterdam. 'Blown away' is the correct term. Had 2 absolutely perfect nights here with my girlfriend, just the best restaurant I can think of, no joke."
207,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"The combination of the plates were absolutely delightful, delicious food, great presentation. Incredible stuff, really helpful, polite and thoughtful, even when it is a big restaurant seems that everything was under-control. Not cheap but definitely worth it."
208,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Argentinean restaurant, i have ever been. It is difficult to list the things that impressed me most: the atmosphere, the aesthetic of the place, the service, the food? Everything was perfect. A little bit expensive but in the end you pay for high quality!Bravo!"
209,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Without the charm of the waitress and the strength of the double gin and tonic I would have docked a star for seating us in an ice-box. Upstairs is cold in the winter! But it is a charming spot, full of character. From the pleasent aroma of …"

216,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lechon! ❤ The awesome roasted suckling pig, by far our favorite every time! Great steak, delicious empanadas, and the octopus is very much worth trying, as well. Not to mention the great selection of mezcal. The people working there are always nice, relaxed and funny, good vibe. Very much recommended!"
217,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing gem. Great food. Beautiful setting. Wonderful service. Be sure to go hungry and share with friends. The suckling pig was amazing. The small plates were delicious.
218,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing!!!!!
The best restaurant in Amsterdam!! Believe me 😊👍"
219,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This used to be five stars, but the service did go down significantly. We were at some point picking our own cutlery and glasses as new people arrived at our table. Jackets we had to bring away ourselves and it took extensive waving to get someone's attention. Call it understaffed or lack of service: previous experiences were better."
220,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great atmosphere and food, had the Tequenos to start which were very tasty and then the Lechon to follow which was cooked perfectly with great flavours. Fast and friendly service, would definitely recommend to everyone in the area"

222,Roses by Sal, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Fixed menu meat place which treats vegetarians as an afterthought. If you're willing to pay the same price as a steak for half a pepper and two chunks of sweetcorn grilled to dryness, this might be the place for you. Dessert is dulce con …"
223,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,a year ago,I love this place! It is so authentic and special. Both meat and the variety of mescal they offer are amazing.
224,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, starters were varied and fun to try, and the steaks, wow the steaks are amazing - go for the ribeye, won't be dissapointed. But if you are vegetarian/vegan they got that covered too."
225,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very well made food, elegant and tasteful. High quality kitchen. The service however not so much. Long wait, and that mean loooooooong wait. And the service staff not so attentive when the glass dries out."
226,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"There wasn't anything not to like about this place. Food, cocktails and wine were all delicious. Atmosphere was great; warm, busy and lively. But what really made the night extra nice was the super friendly staff!"
227,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great selection of delicious tasty small plates. Strong cocktails that feature their specialty--mezcal--and very fairly priced. An excellent option in Jordaan if you are looking for a drink, a snack, or a nice meal."

232,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"good food but the service is terrible. we had a birthday and first they messed up the ""surprise cake"". after that, they refused to separate the bill for the bigger group and acted very annoyed when I asked them for a calculator to do it myself. overall unfortunately a negative experience and we will not come back."

236,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is fine, quite expensive for not having enough space and lot of noise. Small tables with no space between each other. We ask for medium cook meat and it came totally raw inside."

Drinks are super tasty too! …"
238,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lechon (at the photo)
Great selection of mezcal !"
239,Roses by Sal, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If you want to pay a lot of money for a little food, than Salmuera is the place to be. The chicken was small like a pigeon and dry and tasteless and at the end they tried to force us to have a dessert.They will never see me back."

243,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Salmuera is a surprisingly large authentic Argentinean restaurant ... lightyears away from the many formula “Argentineans” in Amsterdam. Their signature dish, the suckling pig, soaked in Sal Muera aromatic brine, is barbequed in plain sight …"
244,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Argentinean restaurant... not to be missed try the beef because  it's good .... but I recommend the slow cooked pork !

247,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We come here on saturday. Without reservation but the nice guy at entrance find us a table. I think this is the best restaurant because is so full. Food is good quality and service is really nice even for be so busy. Little expensive but for us was worth it. Try the salmuera over the lomo steak
248,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing food at an affordable price for Amsterdam. Lovely staff too! Would definitely recommend this restaurant for both tourists and locals.
249,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was ok. Had ceviche and the chicken wings. Neither had the “wow” factor. And, I think our server abandoned us midway through our meal. After we were served we waited and waited and never saw her again."

264,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very good and typical argentinian food, cozy place. Very friendly and helpful waiters. Must stop for the meat/fish lover. Lechon and kraken are very good."

266,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, but a bit too much smoke in the air and it took a long time for the food to arrive. The 4 stars is only because the food was that great, that it deserves all the 4 stars."

268,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food and lively ambiance

279,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Cocktails were awesome. But English speaking table service was so so. Perhaps foreign workers should only service tourists in general.
280,Roses by Sal, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Dishes were OK. Expensive. Busy waiters. You can find better restaurants, with a more friendly atmosphere."
281,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I had the best meal of my life at this place. Literally everything tasted divine, apps, the entry dish, deserts and drinks. I want to go back one day."
282,Roses by Sal, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and staff the only thing I would advice the management is to try to have the music a bit louder as when it's full it is very disturbing and tiring  to hear so many people talking at once  ...  Food wise I have no complainers it's probably one of the best steak I had in Amsterdam
283,Roses by Sal, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very fine slow cooked pork...
