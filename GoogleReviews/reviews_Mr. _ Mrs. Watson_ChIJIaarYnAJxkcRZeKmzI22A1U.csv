0,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Even without being vegan or vegetarian, the best I have tasted in a long time. some vegan cheeses, hamburgers and delicious and very well prepared dishes, and the unbeatable service, a 10 to the manager, cooks and especially to the waitress from France who served us. I am sure that I will return and that I will recommend this restaurant."
1,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing food, amazing experience, cute & fancy at the same time, and super friendly staff. We celebrated my girlfriends birthday and it couldn‚Äôt have been better ! ‚Ä¶"
2,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Such an incredible restaurant. The vegan cheese selection is really astonishing. The vegan camembert and vegan honey are really something. The butternut squash orzo ""risotto"" is really dreamy. The prosecco fondue is worth trying, and the sticky toffee pudding is also a definite must-try."
3,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"We had a very tasty evening meal at Mr & Mrs Watson. The staff were friendly and accommodating, the environment is gemutlichkeit and the food was great. The speciality of the restaurant is their home made vegan cheese which is certainly ‚Ä¶"
4,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Wonderfully fancy Fully Vegan cheese and Prosecco experience! My friend and I shared the Fondue and the Fromage Petit. Great ambience and service. My only negative remark would be that the portion sizes are small. I guess this is ""fine ‚Ä¶"
5,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Hands down easily the best vegan restaurant in town. The food was absolutely amazing, the staff was very nice and professional and the vibe was on point. We will be coming back next year and we are ordering the cheeses real soon!"

9,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Nice vibe, great food and even better drinks. Loved the food so much that I didn't even miss not having non-vegan options. Do try out the Chef Andrej burger and also the vegan mayo dip. The staff was extremely courteous always serving and talking to us with a smile on their faces. Highly recommend."
10,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"It‚Äôs sad that they were out of ragu and it‚Äôs been said when we‚Äôre ordering. Cheese plate has a little amount of cheese, it was another dissappointment. Taste of the food and dessert was fine but not special. I would buy cheese, not visit the restaurant again."
11,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I was curious about their vegan cheeses, but had not particular expectation. I was really surprised by how delicious everything we tried was. Also the staff was super nice and helpful. We‚Äôll be back!"
12,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,a month ago,"What a great experience - even though I am not vegetarian or vegan the food was delicious! We had the burger and it was just amazing!

16,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,10 months ago,We had dinner yesterday and it was so yummy! The cheeses are Devine! The burger amazing and the celeriac shawarma one of the kind! Very recommended! Everything was incredible!
17,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Food: 5 stars. Vegan heaven. The vegan fondue is copious but worth having. Bartender gets his own star for great cocktails. ‚Ä¶
18,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,10 months ago,I visited the Watsons with my no-vegan husband and he said ‚Äúwho need meat? In this way I can eat my greens full of taste! ‚Ä¶
19,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Sweet Jesus of Nazareth, this is so good! My love and I had the Grande Fromage. We had drinks. We had dessert. I just can‚Äôt. Returning in four days to have the fondue."
20,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,10 months ago,This is my second time to this restaurant. I really like their food and drinks. We had a Blue Butterfly Pea Latte and a Gin and Tonic and both were really good. We also tried the cheese platter and the vegan cheese tasted very interesting. The burger with onion rings was also good. A very good place to try if you are a vegan.
21,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great restaurant, but pricey. We had a great evening. As a starter we shared the cheese platter CHARCUTERIE ET FROMAGE. And this was exceptional. Very delicious! Every component was perfect. As main we had the grilled steak burger and the ‚Ä¶"

25,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing vegan food in a warm and cozy space. Every dish is a unique as it is delicious. The range of flavors is large and some dishes are better than meat. The cheese platter is the best as it's a very unique twist to the dairy counterpart. Staff are warm, inviting and friendly."
26,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"I go once every year. The vegan cheeses are unbelievable, really the star of the show. Worth a visit just for those. Decent cocktails, too. Service is so-so, not consistent, it may be amazing or it may be subpar."
27,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the gourmet vegan food vibe here! We didn‚Äôt get the cheese platter, but definitely regret it looking back. The flavours in their pastry and burger were still incredible though! Was definitely worth the trek and money!"
28,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The food in this place is just delicious! The cheese plates üßÄ (served with vegan honey! and a super yummy jam) and burgers üçî are simply amazing. You can even buy their cheeses ü•≥. By far the best vegan restaurant in Amsterdam! üå±

31,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Really friendly staff, very tasty plant-based menu. I can recommend the Korean burger, but whatever you choose, save room for the sticky toffee cake! It's one of the best I've ever eaten üëç"
32,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing all vegan restaurant! The food is so unique and delicious! The cheese platter is fancy, the tortilla special is very flavorful, the burger is better than a regular cheesy beef burger. The peanut brownie is so rich, how is it vegan! ‚Ä¶"
33,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This classic Amsterdam bar turned plant-based food bar is an absolute hidden gem in Amsterdam Oost. Nothing less than exquisite burgers, nothing you‚Äôve ever tasted in your life, delightful cocktails and the most mouth watering sticky toffee ‚Ä¶"

38,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Cannot love this place more. The food was simply delicious (we had the cheese plate, burgers, starters, desserts). Possibly the best burger I‚Äôve ever eaten and the cheese is insane. Really nice to sit there, too. Would definitely also bring non-vegan friends!"
39,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"I can only recommend the vegan cheese selection and the wine. The rest is very average.

40,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,a month ago,"The Valentines menu contained all our favorite food wordplays. From ‚ÄúLife is Butter with u‚Äù to ‚ÄúBeetroot heart-tare‚Äù. We had an egg-cellent stay (even though we don‚Äôt know how to behave in public but luckily they gave us a corner table.) Love, Rami&Juju"
41,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Cheese platter is sooo good, honey and jam amazing! Super friendly and attentive personnel and great desserts. Main courses are a very small portion considering the price (around 20 euro) so nothing changed in this respect over the years. Burgers are ok in taste. 4 stars due to the pricing of the main courses, change my mind."
42,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a lovely little restaurant with a small but pretty well thought out menu! We enjoyed every single course.. Amazing starter due to the creativity and variety of tastes to choose from. ‚Ä¶

47,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"The food is very delicious, but it is too pricey even for Amsterdam.

54,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is such a cool place with very tasty food; we found out that everything about the restaurant is vegan, from the drinks to the furniture. Take a vegan person there and you'll make them happy. Take non-vegans there and they will not ‚Ä¶"
55,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very beautiful place, in- and outside seatings. Small but very special and high quality menu. ATTENTION: VEGAN CAMEMBERTS ! ‚Ä¶"
56,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Yummy vegan cheese! Great space downstairs where we could seat a bigger group. The Blue Butterfly Latte was fantastic. Service a bit slow but probably due to COVID staffing shortages.
57,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Superb meal! The petit fromage starter was perfectly portioned and delicious. The ragu was one of the best I‚Äôve had and my husbands kimichi burger was well balanced. Highly recommend if your vegan or not. Also, very friendly and attentive staff."
58,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Superb. Really great plant based food, we almost couldn‚Äôt believe it wasn‚Äôt actually meat in the burger. Very tasty overall, extremely good service, very nice and open people. Stylish place in a pretty good location. We were at the window, ‚Ä¶"

Vegan Cheese board was delicious, would recommend."

64,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 2 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Food was delicious but service was poor, we kept getting forgotten and the waitress didn't mark one of out orders"
65,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Absolutely amazing  food and dining out experience! Every bite scrumptious! We pigged out and then realized on the way home that we didn‚Äôt feel over-stuffed and bloated like maybe we should after fried food and all kinds of combinations. ‚Ä¶
66,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing. I returned when back in Dam. Going again!!!! The cheeses are outrageous!! I basically always have a cheeseboard and three desserts. They are vegan puddings. Lots of choice so why not indulge? I ended up taking some away.... Can not ‚Ä¶
67,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really blown away by the vegan cheese they have over there. We went for a cheese plank to share for starters. It tasted so similar to ricotta or cottage cheese that I bet most people would be fooled! Plus amazing flavours such as smoke, peppers and spicy. Main course, cashew fondue also was amazing."
68,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow, this is first time ever that I found amazing vegan cheese, a lot of different kinds. It tastes so amazing, I can't believe they managed to imitate like that. Very nice and cosy atmosphere, and polite staff. Recommend."

They varied their menu throughout the year, generally, it's a pleasant lunch and dinner experience, but still the cheese is the star of the show for me. ‚Ä¶"
72,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent food! The sharing menu is worth the price and has some great selections. Everything on the menu is a must!
73,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food and very nice place. The staff is helpful, polite, attentive. The kind of hospitality that makes you feel welcome."
74,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I feel like this restaurant is an elaborate anti-vegan trap to trick vegans into eating actual cheese. But it's not actual cheese?? How is this possible??? It's so good !!
75,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was really excellent, restaurant beautiful and food was great (we had the fondue and the cheese steak burger and the cheesecakes for dessert). Slightly pricey but excellent nonetheless!"

Ate the smoked beyond burger and cheese platter, what an experience, this was sooooo finger licking good!
Friendly service!"
81,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere. A bit on the fancy side which makes it ideal for romantic dates. Nice selection of dishes, not too wide, but good for both newbies and seasoned vegans. The cheese plank was a bit disappointing. I tasted many home made vegan ‚Ä¶"
82,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Best plant based burgers I‚Äôve ever tried. Great selection of beers, friendly staff and nice atmosphere"
83,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I like the idea of serving only vegan food. But I didn't like it. I had the pull pork sandwich. The bread was just sliced toasted bread. It needed more taste. Sth like a housemate BBQ sauce maybe? The portion was very good and the staff is very nice
84,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Mr. & Mrs. Watson is the place to go for when you are in the mood to treat yourself with delicious, wonderful and special vegan food. Their cheese is just pure deliciousness, their desserts always exceed my expectations and I just love how special their main meals always are. 100% recommend!"
85,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's an interesting vegan restaurant, for the netherlands probably falls in the ""fancy place"" category. I personally wasn't too impressed with the cashew fondue and I was a bit bothered by the little amount of personal space in the restaurant. Nevertheless, I'm happy that vegan initiatives exist."
86,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A good experience overall, really unique and well tasting food... like the pulled 'no-pork' made from jack fruit. They really made a creative effort to replace normal meat food dishes. ‚Ä¶"

88,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Very poor service. We had a reservation but were told in a condescending manner on arrival that someone else was still sitting at our table. We then sat at the bar for what felt like an eternity and when we finally were able to sit at our ‚Ä¶

91,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent restaurant. Rightfully nominated for best vegan restaurant (vegan awards). Every time I eat here it's good. I highly recommend going here at least once. Order the cheese platter.
92,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"The food is always amazing and the service impeccable. We let them know about an allergy which meant we couldn‚Äôt have the whole ‚Äúmidnight in Paris‚Äù menu as we ordered, but with their help we could replace the main course and still had a ‚Ä¶"

97,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,8 months ago,fancy vegan place with nice music and friendly service
98,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"I didn't like the brownie with ice cream that I ordered. I was to solid and it was hard to take another piece with the fork. Also it wasn't that tasty and it was cold. I hoped that when I order brownie with ice creams, they will heat up the brownie a bit."
99,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Alchemy is the word I think about when to express the way the Watsons put magic on the table. Proof of great possibilities with vegan food. Even if you are a die hard meat-eater, go here and be surprised by pure creative cuisine. Great atmosphere, great people, just great to go and eat here. Enjoy!"
100,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Completely vegan options. Good ambiance and delicious dishes as well as nice tea. Prices are acceptable. Service should be improved, though."

107,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,This is the best vegan cheese experience that I've ever had.
108,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very experimental foods. Not necessarily bad but definitely needs some revision. Mix vegemite into the mix.
109,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great vegan food! Good-sized portions and original dishes served by friendly staff.
110,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"For someone who has quite a few dietary restrictions it is an amazing relief to come to Mr. and Mrs. Watson. Their food is delicious, yet free of any rubbish or junk that doesn't belong there. They cook honest, plantbased food with great taste made from recognisable sources such as cashew nuts or celleriac. It's just awesome!"
111,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An absolutely excellent restaurant and bar. Lovely food , helpful staff and located ( surprisingly) by a canal. Worth the little trip out from.the centre. The vegan cheeseboard was perfect"

114,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Caring staff and very good desserts! The brownie is amazing. Also nice snacks such as sweet potato fries. The cheese steak hamburger was also excellent. We were a bit less enthusiastic about the vegan cheeses, but still nice that they offer ‚Ä¶"

119,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,a month ago,Amazing restaurants and the burger was the best I have had in Amsterdam üòä
120,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 1 star ,a year ago,"The 'chef' is clearly under the impression that everybody likes sour and dry tasting food. Don't order the prosecco cheese fondue (or gin or whatever dry flavour), it's disgusting! The cheeses are way overpriced, if you order the smaller portion you're left frustrated. It was a nice restaurant once, they've really lost it."
121,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute vegan restaurant with a great (vegan) cheese plate, superb cocktails and a changing menu."
122,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Incredible vegan cheese, had an amazing meal!"
123,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great Food! Especially the fondue. Staff was a bit slow and too few menu choices. It is made so that you always spend 35 pp on your meal (without drinks ofcourse). Even if you just have coffee instead of a desert. Besides that great atmosphere and stylish interior.
124,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 2 stars ,a year ago,"I spent an evening here with my friends. This a beautiful restaurant, really cozy with a comfortable environment giving off a bit of a romantic vibe. The food is very tasty and pleasant. What is not pleasant is the staff. The staff was not ‚Ä¶"
125,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I've never had such a good vegan cheese fondue! The cheese platter was enjoyable as well and their coffee drinks, cocktails and desserts amazing. The service was excellent and always attentive and also the interior was unique. But you should definitely book a table in advance if you wanna enjoy the delicious food of this place!"
126,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Best vegan food ever. You must try the Fondue!
127,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Only had some coffee and a great desert. But quality seems to be the key thing for this place! Great place!

Unfortunately, we did not feel welcome at all. ‚Ä¶"
129,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"very good food, but for the prices the portions could be a little bigger"
130,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The fondue was really good, and the camembert exquisite! It's a bit unfortunate that the fries are not homemade, and we also didn't like the cr√®me br√ªl√©e. It's definitely on the pricey side, but worth it just for the fondue and the camembert ‚ú® If you are to get the Midnight in Paris menu, I'd advise to stick to these two."
131,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We have been a couple of times here.  Some dishes are better than others, but we have had some excellent dishes there. However, the service often leaves a bit to be desired as it takes an ordinate amount of time to even get drinks.  Vegetarians and vegans would love this place."
132,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place is a nice spot in a non touristic area of Amsterdam. I am not vegan, but I like trying vegan places from time to time. The food was really really good, prices are super honest and just a bit below the average. Service was great: the girl serving us was just lovely. We will come back for sure üíØ"

159,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice place, service is good, price is a little high, and I'm personally not convinced by the idea of trying to recreate meat-like dishes in vegan form - as a meat eater even I am convinced that vegan food needs no substitute for meat. ‚Ä¶"
160,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The cheese platter was really epic, for me it was the best vegan cheese I have tasted so far and my non-vegan partner also really liked it.

195,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 2 stars ,2 years ago,not very tasty and too pricy. Waffle of aubergine was way below my expectations; it was like chewing some rubber.  The cheeses were ok but there is room for improvement.  and the price is ridiculous high. Is that because plant based is hype ?  I would not recommend them despite a friendly crew.
196,Mr. & Mrs. Watson, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was great, vibe awesome, but unfortunately food missed the mark. Lacks dimension and poorly executed. Cheeses by far were the most disappointing. Whilst visually they looked good, they were not ""cheesy"" at all. Little to no flavour ‚Ä¶"

Unfortunally Mr and Mrs Watson changed the concept during the 2020 Corona and started full multiple course dining. Trying to cash in on the situation."
