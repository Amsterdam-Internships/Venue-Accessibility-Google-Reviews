1,The Harbour Club Kitchen, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Beautiful facility but horrible food service. Attended a family event that started at 7 pm but the food was not served until 9:30 pm. And it may as well had not been served. The smashed potatoes were stone cold, the steak undercooked or …"

20,The Harbour Club Kitchen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Went for R&B night.  They struggled.  Dance floor kept separating making it somewhat dangerous if you weren't careful.   Dance floor way to small for the number of patrons.  Dancing on carpet was hard.  Music was great though.

25,The Harbour Club Kitchen, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Poor  Hospitality Service!!!  We have friends that have canceled their membership service for the same reason.  Unjustified overly snobby, pretentious club that really isn't all that in food or service.  They have taken the hospitality out …"
