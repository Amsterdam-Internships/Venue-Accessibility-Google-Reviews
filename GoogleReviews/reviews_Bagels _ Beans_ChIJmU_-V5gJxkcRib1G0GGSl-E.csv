0,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 months ago,"Really good food and coffee, but could be quicker for takeaways.

I had the avocado bagel and an espresso. The coffee here is above average and the Bagel is good for the price. Can recommend for a quick lunch."

8,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Bagels are fantastic but the cappuccino could be better. Prices are good and the atmosphere is young.
It would have been even nicer if they had hidden the dishing better for us sitting closest to the kitchen. But other than that, it was a really nice place!"
9,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,LOVE this place! As a New Yorker the bagels were delish the service lovely and the cappuccino yummy!  Such kind staff that remembered our faces from the first day we came. It was right near our hotel so I came here every morning for my ‚Ä¶

13,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,3 months ago,the bagels arent fresh so theyre always cold and chewy and hard to bite. so not worth the price
14,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The place have a wide selection of bagels for all tastes. The staff was very friendly and the food was very good. The location is a nice place for a friendly meet up, but closes at 5 o'clock."
15,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Really amazing bagels conveniently located across from uni. Get the egg salad bagel! You won't regret it ‚ù§Ô∏è
16,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Got takeaway to have by the water. Our bagels were over-toasted that it was dry but staff were friendly and respected social distancing quite well. Could do with cutlery for take away. Not bad but nowadays getting take out and the amount it costs, we kinda expect some care with the quality of food"

29,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,Dog friendly place and the staff immediately offered some water for my dog. Very cozy atmosphere with good coffee and cakes. My personal favourite is their chai latte with a piece of bananabrood.
30,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy and rather big Bagels&Beans next to a University Building. They have Free WiFi and sockets to charge your electronic devices. The Staff was also very friendly and helpful. The food was tasty and the prices are on the lower end compared to similar places.
31,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great service. love the bagel with egg and avocado and the flat white coffee was good. Open early so we could go straight to the Anna Frank house we will come back
32,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely coffee, juices, and food! Good place to work from."
33,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,Healthier choices of food than eating french fries and a burger in the morning. I am also a fan of how they brew and serve mushroom coffee (with dried mushrooms aside the cup!).
34,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"We went there for the bug beagel, but unfortunately it wasn't available again. So we ended up having a Paddoburger, which was excellent and a Meatless Magic, which was just simply disappointing. Probably the worst and cheapest vegan burger ‚Ä¶"
35,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice place a bit outside of the buzzing city centre which is super good when you just need to sip a good coffee in peace. The Tosti bagel is one of their best bagels.
36,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Do not order the Meatless Magic bagel. The vegan meat made us nauseous and the only thing that made the bagel eatable was the mayonnaise and ketchup. The staff and atmosphere are, however, pleasant."
37,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"It's like your regular Bagels and Beans. I kind of want to give it 4,5 stars, cause whenever I go, the staff goes on to ignore me for very long... And I don't go during peak hours. But then when I either go upstairs to order, or when they ‚Ä¶"

39,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Maxsimum unpleasant service and root staff, awful overroasted coffee and not enough tasty food but expensive in comparison to nearby places. Uncomfortable and mood ruining place. The entire day was broken because of enormously rood communication from the owner, or whoever was in charge. Not recommended for great time spending."
40,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Goats cheese, walnut and honey bagel is amazing. The loose tea quantity was a bit less so the taste wasnt really there."
41,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Weirdly terrible service. Went one time, and waited a good 15 minutes for table service before deciding to up and order at the counter (the place was empty aside from two other tables and they had the same experience). ‚Ä¶"

45,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good staff and decent food. Only giving a 4/5 because I asked specifically to not have any tuna or fish in the bagel tapas. It was given to me accidentally. I am a vegetarian and that killed my hunger a bit.

51,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Rushed & chaotic atmosphere, noise, staff doesn't care, and seems to be used to it. Not too clean. Male servant pushed himself through on the tiny stairs. I guess it's too tiny for any quality atmosphere."
52,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Pretty comfy, but sometimes the servers don't notice you, and food takes a while to get prepped. Regardless,  their bagels are really tasty and always fresh."
