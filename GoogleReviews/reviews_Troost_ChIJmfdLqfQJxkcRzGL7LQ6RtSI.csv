0,Troost, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Best food we ate in Amsterdam! The waiters were super friendly, the beer amazing and also the atmosphere great! We will come again!"
1,Troost, 2 stars ,4 months ago,I live in amsterdam long time and I know the price of the city very well. I paid here for a burger 15e with nothing coming with it. Not even a little salad leaf to pretend the burger was not alone. The plate came half empty with this little …
2,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the beat brewed beer bars in town. Has a bunch of different seating options and serves some really incredible beer. Loved all the flavours of the beers here. I especially liked the triple. The staff are super friendly and the food is …
3,Troost, 1 star ,a month ago,"Unfortunately the menu changed to zero meat, was better to offer some meat options. Ok to be sustainable but is contradictory to produce beer, hopefully the production and the beer CO2 supply chain is sustainable too. V Bitterballen dry. Fries still oke."
4,Troost, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great place for a quick drink! We didn’t eat here but will definitely be back to try the food because it all looked awesome. Huge beer selection, most brewed there, and they also offer Bear cider which is made in the Netherlands but not widely available at a lot of restaurants. Super cool atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"
5,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great beer selection of beer made by the brewery. More than a dozen in house beers with a pretty decent selection (even barley wine?!?!?). Staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the beer. Overall I'd say this place is a winner and I would definitely return. Highly recommended
6,Troost, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great place to have beers. It has always been a good place yet quite slow. I was happily surprised that during corona the service became a whole lot faster, we order beers and they were there within one minute, burgers within 5, against the …"
7,Troost, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing burgers!! The menu is very varied, veggie and vegan options. Service is friendly and quick. I had the Umami burger. The meat was juicy and perfectly cooked. The combination of the meat, kimchi and sauce was a new experience !! Def a must try!!"
8,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely spot for a beer and a bite to eat. A good part of a walking brewery tour of Amsterdam. You can hit 4-5 easily on foot without going to Heineken. The staff is delightful and fun. The do not take cash so bring a credit card.

Cheers!!"
9,Troost, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Beer is nice. Food is pretty good, but for the price the portions are honestly quite small. Will go again for beer for sure but not eating."
10,Troost, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Overall a nice place with good beer, although the service was very poor, very demanding and pushy, little or not resolutive at all. They should be more friendly and helpful with their clients."
11,Troost, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"A bit noisy and understaffed, but not too slow. The beer us great, the choice of food cold be richer, but all in all it's nice especially if you can sit outside with good weather"
12,Troost, 4 stars ,2 years ago,A great range of local brews. Spacious interiors. Seating area outside in a conservatory. Their local IPAs are really good. Decent snacks on the menu with veggie options. Staff were attentive and friendly. Large brewing barrels located in …
13,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved this place so much, I ate here twice in 4 days. The atmosphere is perfect if you want a relaxing night with a bar kind of atmosphere. I had bitterballen at every restaurant I could find it and this one was definitely my favorite. …"
14,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice place to go to when you you are thirsty for beer. Service is good, nice hosts and good vibe. Also the banana cake is awesome. Totally worth to try it."
15,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice beer, excellent kafta burger and a delicious mac'n'cheese. Stayed here because they took American cards (no pin#), and am very happy with how it turned out."
16,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very friendly and welcoming place to spend an evening with friends and family.  Wonderful food and different beers to try.  Would highly recommend.  Only small issue is that cash is not taken only card payment.
17,Troost, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,We had a great time here. Tasty beer and great service!
18,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great burgers and beer. A really nice place with great service lots of seating so you do not need to book a table, but can be wise if you are a big group and going on a busy evening. Vegan and vegetarian burgers available so that is great."
19,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food in a very gezelllig place! The bar is pretty big but it gets pretty full very easily during the weekends, so make sure that you have a reservation instead of just showing up there. The bill comes with a QR code and you can pay it with Tikkie."
20,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We really enjoyed our pitstop here on rainy afternoon. As a group of four we all were able to try each of the beers and enjoyed them all. However their honey beer stood out to be the clear winner (as their menu hints at). The food was a welcomed treat as well. We will definitely be back in our next visit to the city.
21,Troost, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool place with all the brewery equipment! Good beers, not too much diversity, but decent selection. The smoked Porter is quite good. also the various IPAs. Food is good. Great sweet potato fries. The regular fries are a bit of disappointment."
22,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had the butter chicken tacos and a few of their brews was a great little bar/pub. Only thing is the waitress has been sampling the wine the whole time we were there so the service was so so but the food was great and I imagine if you get a sober server it would be great
23,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh man, this place is neat. Wide selection of beers all brewed in-house. And a great food menu - Their Troost burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had. Definitely top 5. Friendly staff and good atmosphere. No cash, only card!"
24,Troost, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Here you can find a large variety of beer; the burgers are fine, tasty fries"
25,Troost, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Revisit

After coming back here a few times this year - need to revisit my previous …"
26,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good place for a beer and a burger. Very easy to get there with public transport (tram 12). The service is good. Only thing for me was the very loud noise of other groups, but hey, what can you expect in a place where they serve proper beers"
27,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great selection of beers and delicious food. I recommend the Mexican Bowl for a vegetarian option. The staff is really nice.
28,Troost, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice spot with good service, even when it was super busy. They have a huge menu with many vegetarian options and also quite a few vegan ones (which I wasn't expecting) and alsl some gluten free. We tried a few and they were very tasty. …"
29,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great small brewery taproom with really high quality selection of craft beers. Absolutely recommended.
30,Troost, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Good beer, but mediocre and overpriced food. Charging almost 15 euros for a burger that doesn't come with fries? Come on. Get a drink and go elsewhere to eat."
31,Troost, 3 stars ,9 months ago,Troost is a good option for a lunch or casual dinner. The beer was cold and in general the people around the table were enjoying the food. …
32,Troost, 2 stars ,a year ago,"No complaints about the food - the menu sounded delicious - because we couldn’t get waited on to save our lives.  We’re used to laid back service and were prepared to sit and enjoy the canal nearby and the scenery while we waited, but …"
33,Troost, 5 stars ,a year ago,Super bread pudding! And rather quick and easy service. Prices are pretty normal compared to other places.
34,Troost, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Girl taking reservations by phone today was very rude - changed our reservation to the wrong time, gave up our table and was very unapologetic. Disappointing for an otherwise nice establishment."
35,Troost, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice selection of beers at the Troost Brewery and good how the menu has suggestions of which dishes go well with them. Tried the New England IPA, the Pilsner and the Tropicana. All delivered on taste with the Tropicana being a nice sour …"
36,Troost, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Never ever have i waited for more than  2 hours for my burger.... Never....
Edit: after 2.5 hours we FINALLY got served. With charred black and bone dry burger. A discrase..."
37,Troost, 4 stars ,a year ago,Local brewery offering a large option of beers. We tasted 3 beers and really enjoyed it (fan of one with honey!). You can order some food too. We decided to try the beer plater that comes with some Dutch speciality and it was delicious. …
38,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,delicious beer and food! great value on the tasting flight.
39,Troost, 3 stars ,a year ago,"nice place!

40,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This brewery is in a building that used to be a monastery, and sells unique and fresh beers they make here. Great place"
41,Troost, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Real Cool place and Staff. Neipa is awesome. Other are worth.. Any is good.

42,Troost, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Great brewery with good selection of beers and food. Super friendly staff and central location - definitely recommend!
43,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Oh man, this place is neat. Wide selection of beers all brewed in-house. And a great food menu - Their Troost burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had. Definitely top 5. Friendly staff and good atmosphere. No cash, only card!"
44,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice brewpub. Be sure to note, as others have said, that it's card only. 10 of their own beers on tap in a variety of styles. Friendly service. Try the bitterballen if you want a traditional Dutch bar snack."
45,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic beer and a large variety too. Their standard pilsner is very tasty and very reasonably priced, ranging to the more expensive (but averagely priced) range. They also serve food, as a veggie, it wasn't the best. I have heard the …"
46,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely love this place! Atmosphere is great, and the food & beers are amazing. They brew their own beers & gin - delicious! The burgers (also vegetarian & vegan!) are a real treat and very affordable. Sweet potato chips with truffle …"
47,Troost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Really great beers brewed here. The selection is quite varied and they are quite delicious. If you like fresh pints then try this place. I will be trying all of the beers. Inside is very nice and the there is outdoor seating too. The food menu looks great I'll try the food next time.
48,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,You can not go wrong with beer and burgers in this place.
49,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to go for drinks with a group of friends. Very laidback vibe, big tables, seats inside and outside. Lots of excellent beers on tap, my personal favorite is the New England IPA. Last but not least: the burgers are pretty good!"
50,Troost, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good selection of beers and nice friendly staff. But the food needs a lot of improvements. Took the spareribs and they were uneatable...uncooked with hardly any meet, just fat. Looked as if they were just taken out of the freezer and put in the plate."
51,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice beer. Great burger. Simple bar with good beer and pub food.
52,Troost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice and cool place to spend time with friends. very delicious burgers, each of us tried one different type and all were very pleased about the taste. mine was Classic burger. have good beers also, a bit expansive in price and also bitter and strong in taste. aren't you beer guy go for mild type."
53,Troost, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The people, drinks, food and ambience are all super amazing. I keep revisiting this place. Definitely recommend it :)"
54,Troost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great selection of beers and a simple menu upon which the food is well executed. Burger was excellent and the sweet potato fries were wonderfully cooked. Spring beer = my fave. Interesting black IPA (rich, nutty and strangely light), as well as flavour infused beers, which I did not try c"
55,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice range of honest beers, worth trying a few different ones. The burgers are also giving a good bang for your buck, especially the one with game meat. I am not a huge fan of the interior seating design, which I don't find very cozy."
56,Troost, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious meat balls snacks. Several in-house brewed beers on tap.
57,Troost, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect for a large group and reasonably priced. Food is nice (Troost burger particularly), beer is good and you can reserve. Buzzy, atmospheric place. Service was slow though."
58,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went here with my fiancé and had excellent beer, tasty food, and great service. I would definitely recommend this place to others! They certainly know there beer, especially the IPA and pale ales."
59,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Go here for the Nachos and Honingblond beer. They are just out of this world and amazing. The nachos, served hot, topped with melting cheese and jalapenos along with salsa and superb guacamole are among the best I have had in Amsterdam. The …"
60,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When we first moved to the city, this place tended toward the empty side, and now that we've moved around the corner it's always packed.  No happy medium in Amsterdam! That said, the beer is decent and service friendly enough.  Perfect to sit outside in good weather.  The honingblond is a good everyday drinking beer."
61,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to hang with friends, very good selection of food, many vegan options as well. Take the vegan bitterballen or the vegetarian flammkuchen!"
62,Troost, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very trendy brewery, it can get pretty crowded on peak hours. The beers are nice (not so cheap, tho), and all made by them (they have a good variety, lagers, dark ones, IP A, season beers...). …"
63,Troost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really ample selection of their own locally brewed beers. Nice burgers, ribs and steaks. Good service for Dutch standards. There is a really nice crowd of people in their thirties, nice music; gezellig all the way round."
64,Troost, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"November 2018. Hands down, rhe best burger I ever eaten !"
65,Troost, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Really good place to have a beer. The place brews its own beers and serves them fresh. You may find different kind of beers from lager to IPA. There are also food and snack options to have with your beer. Please be aware that the place does not accept cash, only PIN."
66,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,They have decent craft beers. Spare ribs were just okay.
67,Troost, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The place was legit til tonight. We ordered nachos and beer from a waitress. 15
Minutes later we received our beer. We proceeded to wait for another 40 minutes. We checked in with another employees to see where our food was because our …"
68,Troost, 2 stars ,4 years ago,The Burger was ok. Just OK. The beer was good. But the service is the reason I will never go back here. This place is aiming for 30+ year young hipsters but the service almost feels like seating in McDonald's with 20 year old waiters/tress …
69,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"After a walk from the lovely park, just north of them, we settled in for dinner on a Saturday evening about 8:00 pm with no waiting. The beers were good, IPA's, wheats, and good basic ales. We had pizza and burgers each were okay, but the sweet potato fries were better."
70,Troost, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great selection of beers, ok service, really crowded (we went there on a saturday so yeah..) but the music was really too loud and the genres they played really didn't fit the place. As a group of 4 at one table we had to scream at each …"
71,Troost, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I have no words for such a terrible experience at this place. Waiters and manager refused us, after having dinner and beers to have small birthday cake, with the excuse that other customers will want to do the same, although I explicitly …"
72,Troost, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Some unusual brews (0.5% ABV IPA with a ton of bitterness, for example), a fine selection of styles, tasty snacks and dishes, very friendly staff and a very fine-looking and relaxing establishment, especially at the rear seats, where a pretty garden is in view. Craft beer lovers should pay a visit."
73,Troost, 5 stars ,a year ago,I tried near all home made beers all of them very good quality even though the simplest one. If you're vegan/vegetarian try seitan burgers topper!
74,Troost, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Beer is great, but the food is absolutely horrible and far from Dutch standards. Maybe they should first focus on the offering of one (single) great dish as opposed to the offering of 7-10 overpriced and terrible-tasting dishes."
75,Troost, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The tacos were really simple, something you can also buy in the grocery store for 5 euros only here it costs 14 euros.
The burger meat itself was good but the bun was over cooked. …"
76,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A quaint and cozy microbrewery. Love the burgers and the brews. The classic burger is to die for!
77,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"They forced us to pay two beers we never ordered. Never again.
----
I contacted the owner as he suggested in the response but and he offered to repay the two missing beer. I really appreciated it"
78,Troost, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Fresh crispy flavorful fries and a huge piece of fish make the fish and chips there the best i've had by far.  There are places in London that are close but still don't measure up.  The staff was friendly as well, and I like the cozy feel.  I've already been back twice and will continue to do so.  Winner!"
79,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place stands out for it's wide selection of microbrews, savory snacks and attentive, cordial staff. It's a great place for a drink with a friend, a first date, or even a business appointment.  Just remember that it's card only,."
80,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place. Amazing beers and the ribs.. perfect
81,Troost, 4 stars ,a month ago,Good variety of beers.
82,Troost, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good atmosphere and stylish brewery, great beers on draft, vegan bitterballen and you can ask for beyond meat in your burger 🌱🍔🍺"
83,Troost, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great little brew pub in southern Amsterdam that has an apparent rotating list of in-house brewed beers. Their food menu is mostly limited to standard pub food, but they meet the requirement for a good night if you are in the area. …"
84,Troost, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Here with a group of 8 and the server said we can only order burgers because our group is too big. Logic makes no sense and server is unapologetic and uncaring. Totally unfriendly, don't eat here."
85,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Bar making his own tasteful beers in a spacious and beautiful Berlage-style building. Great to meet up with friends to have a beer tasting, don't forget the beer-board, with original snacks!"
86,Troost, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great beers and cozy atmosphere
87,Troost, 5 stars ,a year ago,Superb selection of beers! Relaxed and on the edge of the very pleasant DePijp area. Worth a visit for sure. A new favourite 👍
88,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Went there during the week and just expected it to be another brewery in Amsterdams hip-part De Pijp. It actually is just another place where you can have a nice pint of beer, but they also have delicious burgers. You might think, that 3 …"
89,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely place and excellent beers. Highly recommended.
90,Troost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent organic burgers and they brew their own beer - which is also quite good. They have a new burger of the week every week, and I don't think I've seen the same one twice."
91,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I was holding off on writing my reviews from this trip because when I got to de Pijp I'd be sad, and here I am. We had a lot of really lovely evenings in this neighborhood, and Troost enabled one of the first. No English right when you walk …"
92,Troost, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"A perfect bar, perfect beer with perfect people"
93,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, great choice of fresh beer made by own brewery. Crowded in weekend - reservation needed. Payment by cash is not allowed, pin only."
94,Troost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Got to troost for a simple yet very yummy meal, some great beers and a casual layed-back evening. The beer cocktails and veggie burgers are an absolute favourite of mine!"
95,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great beers, food, atmosphere"
96,Troost, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great atmosphere with even better beers.  Food was slightly disappointing,  with a very greasy and undercooked gnocchi. The burgers on the other hand were perfect."
97,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Just one step from the busiest streets in the Pijp, brouwerij Troost is a very nice location to taste some of their beers, or just hang out with your friends or colleagues.
Good vibe, nice staff."
98,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very good brewery. I love their IPA and also their burgers. They don't accept cash so don't forget to bring your card.
99,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The beer here is good to great. The Session, Pilsner, and the IPA were all super. …"
100,Troost, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"After waiting 30 mins for my pork ribs, it came dead cold and without much taste. Other than that the Mexican bowl was good."
101,Troost, 1 star ,2 years ago,Waited for two and half hours for a food. That's way too long for even for a saturday night. The staff was really confused and blamed a communication error for the delay. Food that was eventually received was overcooked and clearly done in a hurry. Never going to this place again.
102,Troost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very recommendable - good food (mainly burgers and BBQ) & friendly service.  Excellent beer brewed at the place. Would come back !!
103,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The burgers and flammkuchen were great - as were the selection of beers! Nice music and ambience, too. Definitely recommend a stop here!"
104,Troost, 5 stars ,a year ago,Perfect for super delicious beers!
105,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"For a super busy place, they served our group quick and efficiently on a Friday night. Definitely appreciate it considering the service I'm used to around here (i.e. standard slow and impatient Dutch/EU service!)"
106,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Wow... get the flight for 12 Euros... Such good value. Not the tiny sampler size as in the US but actual beer glasses each.
107,Troost, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The beers are quite good, but not anything above and beyond the great selection of beers at most bars. Seating is difficult unless you book a table and it is a cashless bar, which for travellers is a hindrance."
108,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"They'll offer a brew you'll like, the pub grub is great. Don't go if you are in a hurry as service is Amsterdam benchmark slow - well intended but not very well organised."
109,Troost, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very good beer and great staff & atmosphere! We will definitely come again :)
110,Troost, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Solid selection of drought beers made in-house. Good vibe at all times, but less food and service quality keeping this from being a 5 star place."
111,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great selection of beers brewed locally! Extensive food menu as well. Also have a good location at the westergas.
112,Troost, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Fantastic beer and ""hapjes"", efficient and friendly service and a wonderful & spacious terrace on a quiet street... I'll go back!"
113,Troost, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Bit out of the way, beers are ok, the staff arent the best."
114,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A good range of beers and a food menu with nice variety. A great place to head to if you want to spend some time with friends away from the city centre.
115,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy brewery! I love their beers. What I also love is that there is always room inside (this is not a given in Amsterdam). Happy to be their neighbor!
116,Troost, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Some kinds of beer are perfect, some are fail ones. Food is so-so. Toilets are dirty. Do not accept cash."
117,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to hand out with friends.  Good service and reasonable drink price.  A bit warm inside, but a fair bit of lovely outside space."
118,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great selection of their own beers. Food is decent but quality could be improved. Prices are average for this area
119,Troost, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice beer selection and they brew it themselves. However the service is not great, usually is very crowded, but the attention it's almost non existing."
120,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice atmosphere good variety of special brewed beer . Make sure to place reservation on weekends. No cash payment only debit card.
121,Troost, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Tip: Try the classic burger and a nice IPA. Perfect comb and just delicious. As a side they offer sweet potato fries.
122,Troost, 4 stars ,5 years ago,beer and food! superb quality.

125,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good selection of beers, and a fun atmosphere. The bartenders were incredibly nice and helpful. Credit card only!"
126,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent beer and good service. It's also less touristy and more full with locals that just finished work (during the week).
127,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Tasty homebrewed beer. Food of good quality and relatively not expensive. Trendy place to meet with friends. Bit too loud inside.
128,Troost, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place, packed with locals. Nice in house beer selection, and tasty food. busy spot, but worth checking out!"
129,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It is a fairly decent place. I had the spare ribs, not the best ones in Amsterdam, but quite good. The staff is always on the lookout in case you need something."

131,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice brewery, good selection of beers and snacks. Food looked good, lots of seating, friendly staff."
132,Troost, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good for a beer with friends. It wasn't my favourite as a dinner place. Too dark, average for food."
133,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place to grab a beer! Comfortable and affordable prices. They have their own beers!
134,Troost, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Really great burgers and amazing beers. The Troost IPA is probably one of the best IPAs that I've ever had.

136,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful beers, amazing burgers. Make sure you make a reservation, it gets quite busy in the evening."

140,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Love the Honing Blond beer, one of my favorites! Their burgers are good too."
141,Troost, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there to test beers ans came back quite disappointed. Beers are ok(ish) , service quite slow and prices quite high."
142,Troost, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy bar with friendly staff and an excellent range of beers. Really enjoyable evening
143,Troost, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Only ok pub food, absurdly expensive beer at 5+ Euro/ 25cl ????"

145,Troost, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"if you like craft beer, this place is a must! extraordinary beers, many different styles"
146,Troost, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This place has a super chill vibe. When we were visiting Amsterdam, we came here 3 times in 4 days. My favorite was the bitterballen and the hoplimonade."
147,Troost, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The burgers and beers here are amazing. Besides the Dutch tradition of ignoring clients, the place is great."

149,Troost, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Cool and easy going brewery. The beer selection is sick. Super good quality and great value.
