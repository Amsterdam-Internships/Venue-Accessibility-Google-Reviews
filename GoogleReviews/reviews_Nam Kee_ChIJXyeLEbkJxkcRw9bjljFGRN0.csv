0,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"Authentic Cantonese food. My Chinese friend enjoyed it. Me not so much. The menu is too big. The seating outside is nice and the staff is fine.
May try it again and would recommend if you‚Äôre into that food."
1,Nam Kee, 2 stars ,a month ago,"The menu is overwhelmingly enormous. The wine was very average. The food was okay. At our table we tried a noodle soup with chicken, the beef with crispy noodles, Peking duck with rice. I don't think we would recommend any of it. It's also a challenge to remove the bones from duck with a spoon instead of a knife."
2,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Sometimes it's good and sometimes not so much. It seems to depend on who's cooking. Today we ordered 'crispy' pork belly, which is anything far from crispy. It tastes as if it was warmed up in a microwave. Not Great!"
3,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious food, been craving authentic Chinese food for a while and it doesn‚Äôt come cheaply! Also nice that I can communicate in Cantonese :)"
4,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"It was almost 20 years ago that I visited this place for the last time and it hasnt changed a bit. The food is still good, reasonable prices, very friendly staff and they were willing to adapt the portion size as I was alone. Definitely ‚Ä¶"
5,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,a year ago,We always eat delicious at Nam Kee. We recommend the mix with Babi Pangang and Charshiu and fried noodles. We prefer this Nam Kee better then the other one.
6,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As usual quality Chinese food for a good price. Normally very crowded and feeling rushed to eat, but if you come early (between 16.30 - 17. 30) you can eat relaxed, also guaranteed the pho nam (pork belly), char siu (bbq pork) and Peking ‚Ä¶"
7,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 months ago,I've been ordering from Nam Kee in the Nieuwmarkt quite often the past couple of weeks since being stuck at home with an illness. I order through one of the delivery services. There are three Nam Kee's in Amsterdam but this one is the ‚Ä¶
8,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Went there on sat early evening, not a big queue but then there is a queue when we finish and the restaurant is full. Fair price for right portion. Thumbs up for Roast porc belly as I am a local from Hong Kong. Nice staff and we are well served."
9,Nam Kee, 1 star ,2 years ago,Service was terrible. We ordered noodles with vegetables and tofu and got told they could do with tofu but vegetables was ok. This was basically the final result. Also staff is definitely not nice and keep forgetting about you.
10,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Change is great, but luckily some things don't. And even more luckily, the Nam Kee restaurant is one that hasn't, at least for the last 1300 years or so. Except that now they sell very cool branded t-shirts too. Oysters, dumplings, duck, pork belly, sauces, they serve it all."
11,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,7 months ago,Food is good. Not that much spicy. They have seating both indoor and outdoor. Outdoor is more fun of course. Place stays open till 11 pm.

16,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,a year ago,"If you search for Nam Kee via Gmaps, you‚Äôd probably find the other restaurant at Zeedijk first. The reason might be that a Golden Film Award drama called ‚ÄòOyster‚Äôs at Nam Kee‚Äôs‚Äô was filmed here. It‚Äôs basically about a young minded Dutch man ‚Ä¶"
17,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Loved the food here. Authentic and super lekkkerrrrrr!
18,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,My family have been visiting Nam Kee since the 80's......it has its ups and downs......I have to say that the service have improved allot!!!
19,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Excellent service, very quick, tasty noodles and they serve late"
20,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Average food, vegetable was a bit overcooked. Steamed oysters with vermicelli were good. The waitress was emphasizing the service charge was not included in the bill three times to us. We knew tipping is not common in Netherlands unless service is exceptional. May not be back for this season."
21,Nam Kee, 1 star ,11 months ago,"Ordered Koe Loh Gai last night from this place and had indigestion, upset stomach and diarrhea leading up to the day after, not sure what kind of ingredients they use at this place but have no integrity for the paying customer."
22,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Awesome duck, great service. Some of the food was a pretty watery, but generally great food :)"
23,Nam Kee, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Chinese food, there another outlet not too far away"

28,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Perfect Chinese food! Very good prices!
29,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food and value for money. This is a great standard traditional Chinese restaurant. You see Chinese people eating here, and not because they've been bussed in as part of a tour group. We tried another but standing in line behind a tour group for a restaurant where prices are ‚Ç¨10 per plate more than here isn't something we go for."
30,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Noted some reviews say the food is average and environment not too good. I am from Hong Kong and feel the food is much better than most restaurants in HK. Try the Yang Chau fried rice and BBQ pork. Delicious! ‚Ä¶
31,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Yumm-o! The food was flavorful, savory, and succulent. I was happy to see how clean everything was. The waiter was prompt and polite. This is definitely a spot I'll be frequenting."
32,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Food is great can't fault it.  but when you pay the bill I assume it's up to me how much tip I leave the waitress was very pushy asking how much of a tip I was leaving and wasn't happy at the amount I said . the bill was 80 euros so I said 8 euros which is ten percent she wasn't happy so I left nothing
33,Nam Kee, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Honestly one of the worst restaurant meals of my life. 50-page menu impossible to navigate, a hilariously dismissive head waitress who apparently couldn't care less about us, and when the food arrived it was almost inedible. Impenetrable ‚Ä¶"
34,Nam Kee, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We ordered hot and sour soup & prawn dumpling. This was the most pathetic soup I have ever tasted!  Returned it after the first bite and complained!  Typical Chinese attitude zero customer care, this is how we make ur was the response. Prawn dumpling was served plain no soy,  no sauce to go with it. This was the end of lunch there.."
35,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nothing beats Nam Kee. One of the best Chinese restaurants in Amsterdam. You come for the food here, not the interior design. Price is good. Service is Chinese."
36,Nam Kee, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Authentic Hong Kong Cantonese cuisine. Great food
37,Nam Kee, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"(location:  Geldersekade 117, 1011 EN Amsterdam, Netherlands)
Food is great, service is good, boss is even nicer.  Great to have a Chinese meal far away from home.  We have an enjoyable evening."
