0,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Came in, sat down, waitress side eyed us until another staff member acknowledged us. Saw the reviews and thought the food would be great. Ordered Spicy Korean Chicken wings as an app. After trying we diceded to just pay and leave. Just piles of raw garlic in what I assume is a very mild Chile oil."
1,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,a month ago,Food was amazing and the staff was super fast. We sat near the front and they got to us fast and had our drinks out in minutes and our appetizers our in no time and right after wad gone our food was done and right out. All the food was perfect. Would definitely recommend this place.

3,Smokin' Barrels, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Called in an order 45 minutes before I got off work to find that nobody ever made my food. Had the nice man tell me nobody ever got the order slip, he then said Leslie must have pressed the wrong button when making the order. So thank you …"
4,Smokin' Barrels, 1 star ,a month ago,Every time I go there. There could be 2 other tables of people and it still takes over an hour to get my food. Great place if you want to drink beer while waiting for food.
5,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"My husband and I stopped in for a bite to eat. I ordered the tri tip sandwich with grilled mushrooms and onions with a side of onion rings. My husband ordered the all meat tray (chicken, pulled pork and tri tip) with a side of tater tots. …"
6,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Another really tasty place to sit down and try out some good food. While everything was delicious and the staff was friendly, my only complaint was the portion size. Still felt hungry for more after the main course. Worth it though, they …"

9,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Yummy food, well paced delivery, helpful staff helped me find something for a picky eater. Not exactly kid friendly in that theres no kids menu but they didn't seem to mind we had our 3 yo."
10,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great place. The bar and restaurant have a great feel. Amazing service. They were busy but food came out quickly. Got the full nacho with pulled pork. Yum. Also got pulled pork balls. Yum. Bbq sauce is off the chain. Go quickly.
11,Smokin' Barrels, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Absolutely disgusting, we are SO disappointed. My fish sandwich was burned really bad. The nachos were deconstructed, the cheese is congelled and the chips were also burned. My husband took the food back in and requested that the manager …"

15,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Great food!  45min to get appetizers.  60min to be served the special.  The kitchen is always backed up according to Dorry our waitress.
16,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing burgers with homemade onion rings and coleslaw. I cant wait to try more food here. Great friendly service and atmosphere. A good variety of beer as well. I look forward to my next visit.
17,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"I have never had BBQ ribs that didn't have any BBQ flavor.(!?)

18,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Monday night and went to pick up an order I called in. The three women there were very friendly, helpful, and hardworking! I wish I could've gotten all three of their names but the ones I was able to pick up was Selena and Kelly (I think). …"
19,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,11 months ago,"Waitress was prompt and respectful. Food was hot, quick and was really good. My family and I we're on vacation and not one of us got diarrhea. The place was clean but they had fly bugs flying around the room."
20,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"Good costumer service

22,Smokin' Barrels, 1 star ,7 months ago,Ordered chicken strips which were cheap pressed chicken that were over fried and the burger my daughter ordered was damn near raw. We fed the dogs tonight with $30 worth of food. We won’t go back.

24,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Sat down at a seat at the bar. Ordered the meat platter, side of loaded mashed potatoes, and the pork nuggets for an appetizer. Had an Amaretto Sour and glass of water to drink. …"
25,Smokin' Barrels, 1 star ,a year ago,I just had the tri tip sandwich ($20 with a beer) and was not worth the price at all.  There was hardly any meat or cheese and was served just on a plain bun with hardly any sauce.  First time there and I'm never going back. Plus the waitress seemed busy when there was barely anybody there. Do not recommend!
26,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"This is a solidly 3/5 establishment. The tri-tip was fine, the chicken exceptionally dry. Pulled pork was where the skills showed. Sides seemed satisfying but not exceptional. Service was decent, but the slowness detracted from the …"

31,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I have been wanting to try the burgers here for a long time, and the Fortuna burger contest just happened to be going on this week. My friend Mary and I both had the $7 special Shah burger that was entered in the contest along with a side …"
32,Smokin' Barrels, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I've never written a bad review before, I usually let it go... but my family and I are sick to our stomachs after eating here. The salsa was so old, it tasted fermented. The tri-tip was dry and chewy, the pulled pork was dry and flavorless, …"
33,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered to pick up. It was ready on time. Great prices. Ribs were delicious. The chicken wrap was delicious too. Huge portions. Clean place and friendly staff. Thank you!
34,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Big surprise in Fortuna. The menu has bacon jam and the occasional prime rib. Lots of burgers and sandwiches and a better beer selection than going to eel river brewery. Better service and food too, for that matter. Pulled pork nuggets are top notch. Love the fried zucchini too. Decent prices as well."
35,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Tri tip sandwich with pork wings were freaking good.
36,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,10 months ago,Ordered the Tri-tip sandwich.  They tried to make it like philly and failed.  The meat was over done on the flat top.  Couldn't even tell it was Tri-tip.  They even slathered it with BBQ sauce.  Won't be back.
37,Smokin' Barrels, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Food was okay. Noisy because it's a sports bar.
38,Smokin' Barrels, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It was their first Valentine's Day and they seemed to be understaffed. The food was okay, but the wait time to get an order in and then for food was way too long. Going to give them another try sometime though. The pulled pork nuggets were really good."
39,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Steve, our server, was great! He is the reason for the 2 stars. The tri-tip sandwich was nothing but gristle and cold in the middle. Took over 30 minutes to get 2 sandwiches out. No BBQ on table, which may have helped the cold gristle. Very disappointed in our $14 & $15 sandwiches."
40,Smokin' Barrels, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice space and location, full bar, good drinks and food."
41,Smokin' Barrels, 2 stars ,10 months ago,Ordered the Tri-tip sandwich.  They tried to make it like philly and failed.  The meat was over done on the flat top.  Couldn't even tell it was Tri-tip.  They even slathered it with BBQ sauce.  Won't be back.
