1,Meatless district, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Ambiance was good but I didn‚Äôt like food at all. They‚Äôre so experimental. I tried nut roast as a main course. Kale at the bottom was not chewable and meat part didn‚Äôt remind me any kind of meat.There are lots of vegan restaurants in the town with reasonable price and tasty food. I hope they improve their menu and repices soon.
2,Meatless district, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"For Amsterdam standards this restaurant is actually quite nice. Food was quite good, not over the top but nice. Dessert a bit of a let down, maybe too simple preparation, nothing crazily better than what you could get at a cafe or even make ‚Ä¶"

4,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I've been here a few times for dinners but so far my favorite has been the bloody Mary brunch.

5,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,My friend and I went to try the winter dinner menu. The cheese platter is a must have! The blue cheese and the goat cheese are so delicious and cheesy that I was blown away. The BBQ jackfruit bowl was a bit bland but the presentation was ‚Ä¶
6,Meatless district, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"I really wanted to like this place, being a fancy looking vegan establishment. However.. the food was just not good.. the ‚Äúscallop‚Äù mushroom starter was very chewy and sour (and tiny) and the chicken in the Caesar salad was so hard to chew ‚Ä¶"
7,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was great and nicely presented! Loved the spicy burger, I had to think about it twice before realising I wasn't eating real meat. Desserts looked amazing, service was good. Great place to check out if you are into vegan food, however bear in mind that this restaurant is on the pricey side!"
8,Meatless district, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"I went here with my friend. for me the first time. We went to the Van Woustraat Meatless District. The menu choice were selected, there was not a lot to choose from. My friend went for the ceaser salade and I went for the meatless burger ‚Ä¶"
9,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place. In my opinion, abosulty most visit place for vegan food in Amsterdam, finally a non junk food vegan place. 5/7 would go again. Plus the waitress was very helpful and nice. Fish and chips was amazing and so was the cheese platter."
10,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I really like the concept of the place and the fact that they created popular dishes in an all vegan way.

26,Meatless district, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Mostly loved. Service was too notch. Menu was interesting. But the veggie burger was a bit boring, especially with the advent of Beyond Burger and the ilk. That being said they had some of the best fries I've ever had. Thick but crispy. Expertly fried."
27,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wow, simply wow! This place is everything a vegan is probably looking for. First of all the people working there were super friendly and nice. Then the food... it was so damn delicious we ordered more even though we were stuffed already. ‚Ä¶"
28,Meatless district, 2 stars ,a year ago,Really disappointed... Heard great things about this place but it sadly could not live up to the standards. We had the overpriced (17‚Ç¨) Cheeseburger which was very dry and the Nut Loaf which was lacking in flavor and laid heavy in the stomach. The wine however was nice and refreshing.

30,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I have been to MD van Woustraat for lunch and dinner (big group) and both times I was blown away by the amazing food.

36,Meatless district, 5 stars ,a year ago,Unparalleled plant based restaurant in Amsterdam. Novel dishes (nut roast) and generous portions (lasagne). Even my omnivorous friends raved about the food! The sweet potato fries with the MD burger are out of this world!

41,Meatless district, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best vegan restaurant we have tried in Amsterdam. The service was really good. The starters (focaccia and handmade pasta) were excellent and the Cesar salad  is amazing !
42,Meatless district, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The flowers and balloons from the opening were still all over the place as MD was only open for a week. We ordered the 'salmon' tartar and artichoke for starter and burger and ceasar salad as mains. Food was well prepared, tasteful not too ‚Ä¶"
43,Meatless district, 1 star ,2 years ago,DO NOT ORDER THE PASTA!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  I pride myself on eating and enjoying food the world over - I love food!! I will eat from most street food stalls and get annoyed by fussy eaters. My point being I rarely finish my plate. ‚Ä¶
