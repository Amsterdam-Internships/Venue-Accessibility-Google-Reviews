1,Dum Dum Palace, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Loved the ambience and theme of Dum Dum Palace. Food comes in little portions to be shared- which is great as you get to try several things! Some things on the menu sound better than they taste -like the tarmind pork bellt boa (pork belly ‚Ä¶
2,Dum Dum Palace, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It's nice place and nice concept, it's kind like tapas. I ordered 3 kind of foods and shared with one other friend. The taste is good. Definitely try their sambal along with the food to give it more taste. The staff is friendly."

8,Dum Dum Palace, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Place looks cosy at first. People queuing so must be great. You would think...
Food is highly overpriced. If you ask 9 euros for 4 dumplings, the quality should be top-notch. It's not. The food lacks flavour. Doesn't even remind of Asian ‚Ä¶"
