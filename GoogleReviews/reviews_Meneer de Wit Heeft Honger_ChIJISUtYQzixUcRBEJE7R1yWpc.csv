0,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I had dinner with a group of 10 people at Meneer de Wit heeft honger and the food was was amazing. Very fresh ingredients and surprising flavours. A true experience. We also had some good wine and the service was excellent. Good price for such high quality.

2,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"It is unbelievable what this chef and his team can do with food. The ingredients that are chosen, the combination of them and with that the flavours that come together is just awe-inspiring. The menu changes regularly which keeps us coming ‚Ä¶"
3,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"As a veggie, this was heaven! Shared dining is the way forward. Though it's recommended to eat 5-6 dishes and the tasting menu starts at 6 dishes, my mom and I would have had enough at 3-4. The flavours, herbs and preperation surprised us ‚Ä¶"
4,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really a good restaurant with great staff. The dishes are more for sharing and lot of them are vegetable based, while they also offer some (not day-to-day) other meat dishes. Absolutely a recommendation, despite the somewhat high prices"
5,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely delicious veggie dishes and very decently priced. The meat dishes could have been a bit more imaginative. Next time I would go for the vegetarian tasting menu. Friendly service and cozy seating.
6,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"It's rare that you go to a restaurant and you find yourself continuously learning something new. From the star anise in the jus to the smoked watermelon, the whole menu tonight was inspiring. Not to mention the staff are wonderful, the wine ‚Ä¶"
7,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,6 months ago,For me one of the best food experiences in Amsterdam. Also very nice and Good Service. We will definitely come back.

9,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,a year ago,What a great experience! Wonderful outdoor setting next to the canal; great service from two wonderful waitresses: really interesting flavors in some delicious food; and brilliant wine recommendations. Can‚Äôt be faulted. Well done guys! üëèüèª
10,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A lovely evening meal! We got the 6-course vegetarian menu which turned into 7 courses with a complementary appetizer from the chef. Each dish was unique and highlighted the fresh local produce. The service was friendly and welcoming, and ‚Ä¶"
11,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This is great place and has a large room for groups as well.
12,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"We were 9 people and asked for 1 vegetarian menu, 2 meat menus and 6 meat & fish menus. Initially they accepted the order, then came back saying that they cannot cook just one vegetarian menu, so we need to get 2 and that they cannot cook ‚Ä¶"
13,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice flavors, but portions are small"
14,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love this place! Such a pleasure to have them in the neighbourhood. They recommend 5 to 6 dishes for 2 people but we actually were already full after 4 dishes. We had the seabass which was really flavourful, roasted aubergine was very ‚Ä¶"
15,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Great service and wine. Food was good but not spectacular. Portions for sharing were a bit small. Overall, quality-price ratio was pretty low."
16,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was delicious, we went for the ‚ÄúChef‚Äôs Choice Menu‚Äù and we were presented with a great selection of dishes.
Service was great, polite and welcoming, with great care for details.
Price is not for every day/causal dining, but totally worthy of a nice occasion."
17,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious food n flavours prepared with great care and attention to detail.
18,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great restaurant, cosy atmosphere, super friendly service and the food.... Vegetarians, eat your heart out!! But also for meat-lovers there are some tasty and surprising plates. Delicious wines... Best restaurant evening in this area!! Everyone should eat here at least once in their life!!"
19,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 1 star ,2 years ago,Reserved for 3 people and we were put on table for 2. We requested a bigger table and were told its the cosy atmosphere but all group of 3 were seated in a 4 seat table. Had to put the candle away ourselves and the wine had to be put on the ‚Ä¶
20,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Im okay with paying 60‚Ç¨ per person for a nice dinner, but I expect the quality to be too, the quantity to be good and the service to be excellent. None of the above was met for our group. We tried 70% of the menu and we didnt get a wow ‚Ä¶"
21,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Too pricey for the quality you get.  You have to order several dishes (their share food concept), which are small in portion and flavours are ok but not more then that. ‚Ä¶"
22,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Avoid!
Quality of service and food is low for the price.
Took 2 hours to get the first 3 out of 8 dishes. ‚Ä¶"
23,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food. Very nicely executed vegetarian dishes. Super friendly staff who gave descriptions of every dish. Highly recommended!
24,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 1 star ,4 years ago,AVOID!!  They serve crazy overpriced food which is not even well cooked. (sometimes quality forgives). For ex they offer a rib-eye at 30 eur that is just the piece of meat without any side dishes. And it was burned and full of fat. ‚Ä¶
25,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good quality food and very nice staff. A set menu which isn't known from the start which makes it fun to come back at a later time as well plus you'll be served something that you wouldn't have chosen at the beginning so nice to try new food
26,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"What these people do with vegetables is simply amazing and inspiring and awesome. We never dare to order less than 7 courses, because we are too afraid to miss out on even one of these great dishes."
27,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food.  5 star and serive, but 4.5 hours was quite a long time for dinner. Would recommend but just a little shorter service time and this place would be perfect!"
28,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great atmosphere, excellent food!"
29,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not quite as good as it thinks it is. Decor nice upstairs,  not so great down, nice staff, 4 / 8 dishes were amazing (burrata, hummus, duck egg, pulpo), but the rest ranged from ok to inedible (seabass)"
30,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,An absolute must when in Amsterdam. A bit off the beaten track but the food was outstanding.  We had the vegetarian sharing menu which was amazing. Best food we‚Äôve had here for a long time.
31,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Different but very good food and excellent customer service.
32,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The food tasted very good but portions were too small for me (big eater). When I told them they made portions bigger. Very friendly service
33,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super food, across the board. Mediterranean food primarily with strong flavours and influences from the Levant. Small and generally always full, but well worth a try."
34,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"As I'm incredibly picky with food and good restaurants (hard to find in Amsterdam in my opinion), this place is solid and a place for me to return. I only give 4 stars because it did put a bit of a dent in my wallet, but if I could I'd make it 4.5 stars"
35,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Original concept mediterrean restaurant. Fish,meat and vegetable menu. Waiters and chefs are very Gent.le and friendly.really recomended"
36,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Really average food. Was expecting so much better reading the reviews. People working there however standing out in Amsterdam for being friendly and nice

46,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good food. At times daring and on the heavy side. Gotta love meat..
47,Meneer de Wit Heeft Honger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice service, friendly place.
Felt value for money questionable, sharing potions rather meagre, especially for larger groups."
