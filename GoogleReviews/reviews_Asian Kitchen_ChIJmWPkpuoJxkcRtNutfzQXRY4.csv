68,Asian Kitchen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food is very good and price to value is excellent. It can be very full and you get the feeling sometimes after eating you need to wrap up things fast and pay and go out. It is imaginable due to the small location and the crowd. However food ‚Ä¶
69,Asian Kitchen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cheap and cheerful, this place will satisfy your craving for noodles & rice. My go-to is the stir fried noodle with chicken with vegetables, which is a really ample portion and comes with chili oil on the side so you can apply to taste. ‚Ä¶"

77,Asian Kitchen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Staff were very friendly. I was quite eager to eat Asian food, so I visited here. I am not sure about other dishes, (I ordered vegitarian rice), the one I had was not good as I expected. But it seems to me other guests were satisfied. So next time, I would like to try other dishes."
78,Asian Kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for Asian streetfood served very quickly. The dishes are brimming with flavour and authenticity. Around dinnertime there is usually a short wait if you're in a party greater than 2 but their speed speed organization is such that that's rarely more than 5-10 minutes. And the foodcis definitely worth the wait.
79,Asian Kitchen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Small restaurant with really tasty Asian dishes at affordable prices, I had the vegetarian noodle soup and it was really good and big and the other dishes look like they‚Äôll get you going on for hours, really big portions do you might as ‚Ä¶"

89,Asian Kitchen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A hole in the wall joint, with amazingly superfast service. Food is good, and light on the pocket. I would suggest that you take your food to go or you would end up smelling like the food you ate. Recommended for a quick meal."
90,Asian Kitchen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very delicate foods here. The fried rice exceeds my expectations: good mix of far eastern and south eastern asian ingredients. And the chicken broth soup? Perfect. However the beverage choices are rather limited. I suggest sweeter, less sour options. Overall, Asian Kitchen is a must try asian food restaurant in Amsterdam."
91,Asian Kitchen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best Asian places we‚Äôve tried in Amsterdam. After moving from the states, we were missing some of the great Chinese food back home. So happy we found Asian kitchen and we frequently visit both locations. Highly recommend the King Pao chicken!"
92,Asian Kitchen, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"My friend ordered the crispy peking duck, which was far from crispy. The duck itself had clearly been sitting way too long as it was a dark, unappetizing gray color. She couldn't eat any of it, but had to pay the ‚Ç¨12.50. Receiving our food ‚Ä¶"
