0,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice cafe, friendly staff, great location, enjoyed my green tea and apple pie."
1,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I love that place. It's so nice inside, the Belgian beer choice is really good. For this who don't like, lots of other things to choose from."
2,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,One if the best breakfast in Amsterdam. We are already eaten twice here!
3,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The location is in the center of Amsterdam with a lot of exposure to the city attractions points. …
4,Dwaze Zaken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"We came here twice for breakfast. I would recommend the bread with egg on top. Food is tasty and way better than the pancakes (fruit straight from the can), see the pictures below. …"
5,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stopped by for lunch. Everything we ordered was delicious (burgers, salad, sandwiches) and quick. The waitstaff were friendly and very helpful."
6,Dwaze Zaken, 1 star ,4 months ago,Terrible service!! Drinks took forever.. we were waiting more then 40mins for the food just to know afterwards that the waitress didn’t even order our food after she took the order. She literally came back and said “did you order any food with me?”
7,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice location, great food very friendly staff, love those decorations and interior design."
8,Dwaze Zaken, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Decent food but horrid service. Waitresses don’t come by often, and belatedly brought us dirty silverware (used knife, had butter and something hairy on it). Strongly recommend Pancakes Amsterdam across the street, even despite the wait - they’ll at least make sure you’re taken care of."
9,Dwaze Zaken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Except for the fact that they forgot our order first, it was pretty good. The food tastes good (but we had to wait one hour to get it)  the service is friendly and the location pretty cosy."

12,Dwaze Zaken, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We had breakfast here, which was good and the staff are kind. Our table was directly at the door, which was really cold and drafty. The installation of a curtain would have been a pleasure."
13,Dwaze Zaken, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Have fond memories of this place during one of my trips before. Enjoyed the close proximity to the Centraal Station and cosy ambience in the cafe, with nice Christian inspired messages. Nice food without being pretentious, and good service."
14,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food for a really good price, just across Amsterdam central station :)"
15,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious good, friendly staff. Central location. Will definitely be back"
16,Dwaze Zaken, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Food was really good very cosy and nice atmosphere staff was very nice and friendly and happy serve. Hot chocolate was really yummy and the English breakfast was very nice and with a different take. Only thing is I would've loved a bit more variety in the menu but other than that it was perfect

20,Dwaze Zaken, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice bar in front of the central station Amsterdam. We use it for waiting for our final train back to Germany. Just the opening time Could be a bit better.

26,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, and the food is terrific. I suggest the pulled-pork-bouwkit. It's out of this world."
27,Dwaze Zaken, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Drinks oké. Food average. It is not as creative and artsy as they advertise. Also, while we were having dinner and wanted to order another drink, it was suddenly closed... Never experienced that before"
28,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Went here because there were huge queues for some of the nearby restaurants and our gamble paid off. Its a relatively small restaurant/cafe and we visited for breakfast. Food was reasonably priced and portion size was good. Atmosphere was …
29,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My experience here was good, I was really hungry and no idea where to eat, the pancake place opposite had huge queues so just went here and sat outside. The staff were attentive and my order came really quickly, was tasty and just what I …"

32,Dwaze Zaken, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Good area, sat outside.  Didn't seem terribly busy outside or inside (at least 2/3 of all tables empty on a Saturday night at 19:00).  Drinks were taken quickly by the one waitress on duty and delivered by the bartender.  Since we had just …"

Very very nice food - take the Dansih (organic) pancakes or the three eggs, very …"
36,Dwaze Zaken, 1 star ,a year ago,"Not only was the service bad (took a long time to order anything), but the food was not any good. The drinks were okay (of course we only had produced products), but I wish there was more to chose from."
37,Dwaze Zaken, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Never experienced such a rude staff. One of the members yelled at my friend to leave and slammed his tray, because he didn’t want a drink out of a group of 15 people. Not good food or drinks either. Won’t come back."

43,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The farmers breakfast was delicious and filling. Ladies working there are sweet and efficient. Small place, limited menu but our group all enjoyed it."
44,Dwaze Zaken, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The waiter was reluctant when we asked for ice. Later he served it with his bare hands.
Food was good, but the way he handled ice speaks about the hygiene levels of the restaurant"
45,Dwaze Zaken, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The location is nice, right next to Centraal Station. We ordered the english breakfast and farmer's omelet. The English breakfast was the worst thing we ordered in all Amsterdam, the egg was overcooked on one side and completly raw on the …"
46,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious! English breakfast here isn't your typical block-your-arteries you would expect from a full English breakfast but it's really tasty and has a nice twist to it. …

52,Dwaze Zaken, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very friendly staff, really lovely interior and tasty food! We had the sandwhiches which were great, not super expensive and did the job of curbing our hunger as we meandered about Amsterdam."
53,Dwaze Zaken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Didn't realise this was a Christian bar when we entered but it wasn't forced on you too much so that was ok. Just stopped for a couple of beers so can't comment on food. The service was fine and the beer selection was varied.
54,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, coffee and prices. Were very accommodating ofour kids and friendly with them. We were happy to have stumbled upon such a good place in such a touristy area."
55,Dwaze Zaken, 1 star ,5 years ago,Not sure how anyone can run a business this way. We have now been waiting one hour and 15 minutes and still no sign of the sandwiches we ordered. The food looks lovely but it doesn't really work as a restaurant if you never get to eat it.
56,Dwaze Zaken, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We haven't even had a chance to taste the menu or drink anything, because once we found a free table a waiter came and informed us that the place is so busy that we can't order anything!

62,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Surprising and good. I ordered what I thought was just a normal tomato and mozzarella sandwich. What I got was expertly done.  Slightly sweet, savory, touch of arugula.  Delicious."
63,Dwaze Zaken, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Pretty cool cafe, nice coffee, very friendly service, more interesting than a chain, located very close to the train station, I had a very tasty bacon and cheese crepe and the total bill was very fair, the toilets are extremely interesting and worth a visit ;)"
64,Dwaze Zaken, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I was just about to go somewhere else after having a nice afternoon in this place, but not having anything to eat as such - then decided to go for a steak - I am glad I stayed - it was off the scale, done as requested, succulent, moisture, …"
