0,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It was a bit quite when we went in, but don‚Äôt let that fool you if it‚Äôs ever the case! After a little while the place was cozily busy. Rightfully so! The burgers (and nachos) were lovely, as was the staff. I would definitely recommend this place if you‚Äôre around and in the need of a good burger."
1,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice cozy place which serves very tasty burgers! The staff is friendly and you are served pretty quickly. They have a good selection of burgers and other goodies. The best thing is you can even get a gluten-free bun for no additional cost. ‚Ä¶
2,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice place. One of my favourite burger joints whole visiting Amsterdam. Reasonably priced and good quality food. 40euros for 2 burgers and 2 drinks
3,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The Service was quite good but the burgers we ordered were small for the price we paid for. The classic burger was okay but a bit too cold. The Portobello burger says ""grilled vegetables"" but it had almost no vegetables on it. The Burger ‚Ä¶"
4,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I had a very nice experience! The staff were really nice and were kind to switch the buns for iceberg lettuce (making it Keto friendly). Would highly recommend if looking for a keto friendly place in Amsterdam.
5,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Ellis Gourmet Burger - Today (15.03.2018)  I would give 6 stars as the burgers were free, but even if you have to pay for them, they are worth it. They are really one of the best in Amsterdam. Supertasty and the bread is perfect as well as ‚Ä¶"
6,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The taste was okay. Unfortunately, when we got the food the burger was already cold. The service was friendly and gave us some tips for the city."
7,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The only disappointing thing about this place is the fact that there was nobody else eating here! The food was fantastic; fresh, quirky and well cooked, and the service was excellent. ‚Ä¶"

10,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Place looked really good and thought it may be a good company as they have restaurants across Europe but never been so annoyed with a place. Very well done out, cool newspaper style menus and serving staff were great. But 45 minutes after ‚Ä¶"
11,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great burgers at a reasonble price. Especially love the fact that they have Belgian special beers at a normal price point (as in not overly priced for tourists), almost the same as if you were buying them in a Belgian bar. Would have added the fifth star if they paired the beers with a specific burger."
12,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to eat and interesting burgers. But they didn't get it right at all. Had to ask for the fries and for the second beer twice. Brought one burger with onions although we ordered without. And no word about the fact, that these ‚Ä¶"

18,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We had to wait 30 minutes to order our dinner. The food comes very fast, but was only lukewarm, not hot. The burger was good and the sides were ok."
19,Ellis Gourmet Burger, 1 star ,2 years ago,I am right inside the place now with my boyfriend (Koningsdag/King‚Äôs day). We are from Brussels and came in as seeing Ellis as the salvation board for the food today. ‚Ä¶
