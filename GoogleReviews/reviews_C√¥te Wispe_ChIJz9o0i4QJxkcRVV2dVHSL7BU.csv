0,C√¥te Wispe, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really high quality food served here and you can tell they are really engaging with their customers. The salmon steak is a must-try! The restaurant also has a really nice vibe and you can sit outside with cuisine and blanket while looking at the Amstel river.

2,C√¥te Wispe, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I was looking for a Spanish restaurant that it used to be in this location before and found it was replaced by this one.

11,C√¥te Wispe, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My life support on coffee during this crazy pandemic, one of the few places who dared being open to serve the community and give it a sense of “normality” in abnormal times. Thank you guys for the amazing Lattes and Cappuccinos"
12,C√¥te Wispe, 1 star ,3 years ago,One of the most unsanitary  places I've ever eaten. They had the mayonnaise/aioli sitting on the floor by the fryer being put directly  on to people's orders. I saw them take wine from a glass they noticed was dirty and pour it into a clean …
