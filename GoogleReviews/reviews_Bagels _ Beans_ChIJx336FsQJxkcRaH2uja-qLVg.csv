1,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 months ago,We must've went here like 4 times in 6 days. The coffee was one of the best I had in the Netherlands and the bagels were very solid as well.
2,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great service, great bagels, and great coffee! Perfect for those looking for vegan options and a nice atmosphere with fresh and tasty food. Good value for money especially for my large coffee that was as big as my head!"
3,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Excellent choice for a quick bite to eat that is delicious and satisfying. The food comes out fast but it doesn't taste anything like fast food. Great prices and service!
4,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Delicious food and drinks.  best gluten free bagel, maybe the only actual GF bagel I‚Äôve had. Vegan cream cheeses that are delicious. Fresh veggies. Highly recommend but be advised they are sort on staff Oct2021 and service is slow."
5,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Brilliant service, tasty bagels. The staff are probably the highlight of this place, all really  freindly and helpful. The bagels are equally brilliant. I've been several times and the BLT is brilliant. The wild salmon and cream cheese is ‚Ä¶"

7,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very cozy place with a lot of healthy food. Yes, bagels don't always mean ""fast-food""! You can order gluten free options, perfect salads, fantastic coffee wuth oat or almond milk. Dog&kids-friendly"
8,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Food is consistent no matter which branch you go to.
In this particular branch on this day they were short staffed and it showed. The waiter came across as very false Happy, and you sensed he has ready to explode."
9,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice bagels, although my friends salad wasn't washed and had a little bit of dirt in there. However it was still very pleasant and tasty"

13,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,Went their on a Thursday morning and it was really calm. Used this place as a homeworking Office and it was really nice. Staff was really caring and talkative :-) I went for the salamon bagel with cream cheese (around 9‚Ç¨?) and the verry ‚Ä¶
14,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Chain of bagel and coffee restaurants. The menu items seem perfect for both breakfast and lunch. The iced coffee is AMAZING. The bagel sandwiches were great too. The prana bagel which was interesting but I recommend reading what it is before trying it. The prices of the menu items seem reasonable.
15,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best bagels in town! A lot of vegetarian options, great coffee and healthy juices ! Great herbal tea options as well :) do not miss it if you are visiting and also have to work remotely, the perfect place to work and to eat some good healthy food that is also quit affordable !

17,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This place was good, it only had a very select few options for vegans however. But the bagel that I had was pretty tasty. Coffee was also tasty and the price was good too. Decor and service could be improved on. Not keen on the mismatching crockery."
18,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful rustic interior, nice staff and AMAZING bagels! Their gluten-free bagel is very tasty. I highly recommend eating your lunch here! I‚Äôm definitely coming back!"
19,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Very bad place. You wait for one bagel approximately 30 min.
They don't clean the tables when a costumer leaves the store. You have to tell them : ey jo, clean this up or for what are you waiting for."
20,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Amazing Bagels. The bagel with salmon is the best. Fresh salmon. I just ate here and it was perfect. The staff is great and friendly

26,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Super clean and friendly. Music was good and the food was excellent. Next time I'd pass on the espresso though.
27,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,5 years ago,"‚ÄúUnorganized & chaotic‚Äù
I only walked in here because I thought it would be good to try it as it being a local restaurant option rather than the giant chains. Well I wish I didn't, ‚Ä¶"
28,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Nice place which holds some great bagels for vegans also. Enjoyed it a lot.
29,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best coffee in my life. Ask for receipt and stuff friendly helped me. Will try to make the same in my country, but strongly recommend to drink first here."

38,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really nice place with good service.
39,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,a year ago,Seeing the ratings I was honestly expecting more than just an average breakfast Store. Wasn't really worth the walk there. The bagels were dry and the store is not that special neither. Don't get ne wrong I would advice against it.. Just saying that you should probably not expect to be thrilled by it.
40,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,a year ago,"Maybe this chain overall is not bad, but my experience at that place was awful.
I came for a breakfast, my table was dirty with a sticky spot and black hair on it. ‚Ä¶"
41,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing service, lovely fresh mint tea (generous with mint too!). Me and my partner had the tuna bagel and the mozzarella bagel and they were exquisite. This place is a big part of why I come to Amsterdam."
42,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,7 months ago,Very pleasent Place. The Stuff was very nice happy. Overall it has a very warm feeling and i would recommend it if you are near
43,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Absolutely amazing place! Had a quick lunch here on a rainy day, found a random bagel place. Turns out they have GF bagels, which made me extremely happy! They were delicious and staff was so funny and friendly!! Will definitely visit again! üòçüòç"
44,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Classic bagels and beans, although this is one of the few branches still putting those addictive chocolate beans in front of you:)"
45,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very good ! Thanks so much for the lunch. I recommande !
46,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the Bagel & Beans chain. Last visited this branch March 2019. The guy who served us was friendly, polite & attentive and our food did't take long to arrive. Always good quality. However, the Almond Latte is a very acquired taste! :-)"
47,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Delicious bagels with toppings, not so delicious coffee."
48,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,5 months ago,‚ÄûOh you are seven people I cannot tell everyone which bread we have. I have ONE more table.‚Äú
49,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"love spending my time here either studying for uni or just hanging out with friends. The bagels are awesome, the staff is always friendly even though it can take a while for them to take your order (or notice you are there) when you are sitting downstairs, which is where I almost always prefer to sit."
50,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved this place so much that we went twice when we were in the area!  The coffee was the best I had on this trip and the many different bagels, oh my goodness, YUMMMMMMM!  The staff was very friendly and it was very clean :)"
51,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My favorite and trusty cafe! Yummy food and drinks, good service, vegan options available, healthy foods and good quality goods. Always a joy going to Bagels and Beans. You can also save points via their app which is great."
52,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"A beautiful little spot where you can get some decent, healthy food if you want it! There is a reasonably priced wide selection; you can choose your type of bagel and your type of cream cheese when ordering one of the excellent, varied and ‚Ä¶"
53,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice little cafe to visit and have a few coffees with friends
54,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"My first ever bagel! A small place, but it‚Äôs got a homely feeling. Staff are very friendly and it‚Äôs not too expensive for the area either. You might want to bring cash as for some reason it rejected all 4 of mine and partners UK debit cards."
55,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fresh, beautiful food. Staff are lovely and helpful. You MUST visit!"
56,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good bagels, lots of options including vegan and gluten free. Price is ok, not that cheap but considering location the price is fair. They have nice fruit juices also. Really enjoyed our brunch here and would recommend, the menu is also ‚Ä¶"
57,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This one is my favourite Bagels & Beans in Amsterdam. Sneak downstairs to find a seat even when it's all packed on the ground level, and then watch the feet of shoppers above. It might be smart, in fact, to place your order before going ‚Ä¶"
58,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,8 years ago,"Needs a clean up, but it gives it a certain charm. Both of us had a lovely bagel. I had brie walnut and honey. If your not local make sure you understand the coffee you order. We ordered large but got double espresso -  was very nice ‚Ä¶"
59,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great bagels, great flavors! Truly not expensive for what you get."
60,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Delicious fruit popsicles. Especially liked the watermelon mint flavor. Great coffee too. Highly recommended!
61,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty bagels with a great selection of bagel breads. A pretty interior with friendly staff. I ordered the meatless magic and I think they need to heat the part up or perhaps they forgot because it was cold and detracted from the overall ‚Ä¶
62,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We had lunch at this place. The tables outside were served very slowly and by a grumpy waiter. The food was mediocre (dry bagel, not so tasty filling).
But then came the worst part of our experience. I have paid separately and my ‚Ä¶"
63,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food was okay but coffe didn‚Äôt meet expectations (have been to B&B before). The worst thing was that the owner was behind the counter and enjoying a cheese bagel himself while prepping our drinks. We could see from our table that he was ‚Ä¶
64,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Yeah, was nice, (went in 2015) was not too crowded, short wait for food arrival, but also neatly constructed bagels (i.e. not sloppily slapped together). ‚Ä¶"
65,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Bagels are delicious and the coffee is great aswell!
A perfectly tasty and healthy breakfast!"
66,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very poor and slow service and condescending owner. Half of us were not able to eat !!  We were a party of seven people today. We were seated outside. We waited 30min to get our tables cleaned (they were very dirty and we asked for it ‚Ä¶
67,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Tasty Bagels and coffee! Would go there again.
68,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cute place with several locations in the city of Amsterdam. Good variety of coffee and tea drinks and tasty bagel options (also vegan and gluten free options). Prices are fair and service is fast and nice. ‚Ä¶
69,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,a year ago,"It is not a place you can sit and chat for 1.5 hours by drinking only coffee, they will come and ask at least 3 times what you would like to drink in 10 minute intervals after an hour. There are better places around that you will feel more comfortable."
70,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,6 months ago,We got sent away because we couldn't sit 5 people at the same table.
71,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,4 years ago,Don't expect to be treated friendly or nicely when you don't speak Dutch. We sat down for a good 30 minutes and even asked the staff three times to take our order. Instead they helped two groups that came after us instead. Very disappointed ‚Ä¶
72,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful food as expected with the quality received it was busy but had a great atmosphere. Every single staff member was friendly and willing to help as much as possible. Gluten free.
73,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"A great place for coffee and breakfast!! Would definitely recommend! The staff were really friendly and served us quickly. While it does get quite busy, there seems to be always somewhere to sit. We returned the next day after our first time here, loved it."
74,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place to grab a bite to eat and a drink. Had a really nice pink ginger drink and a vegan bagel. Lots of options if you have any dietary requirements such as gluten free or dairy free.
75,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Fantastic cappuccino and bagel choices. Everything bagel ordered ""toasted strong mature cheese"" came with ham and tomatoes. Location close to center city. About 16 Euro for 2 cappuccinos and 2 specialty bagels. Charge station at front bar seating. Restroom downstairs not safe for elderly or handicapped people."
76,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I'm a big fan of B&B in general. However, this location is a disaster because of the very rude owner. We wanted to get some breakfast, walked in and chose a table next to the window since we wanted to enjoy watching the street life. For ‚Ä¶"
77,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My friend had the vegan bagel burger, which was quite nice. But my cream cheese bagel with black olive tapenade and dried tomatoes was the bomb. Also the vegan pecan pie! Definitely would go there again, and there are lots of vegan/vegetarian options on the menu."
78,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent bagels and fresh juices and coffee!
79,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,5 years ago,This place is always very busy. Sometimes it's hard to get a table. Good thing there are more Bagel & Beans shops in town. But the food is good! Bonus: they serve a gluten-free bagel.
80,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Tasty. Quick. Loved getting it to go and enjoying sitting outside to enjoy my meal
81,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Even though they knew we're clearly locals, we were asked to pay in advance of receiving food which didn't leave the best impression. Because it's not the norm in Amsterdam it gives impression that they think you've done something wrong ‚Ä¶"
82,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love this place! Really friendly And cozy. I can definitely recommend this place!!!
83,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Long service but good food.
84,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,Amazing bagels! I would love to have something like this in my country too. They even have gluten-free options if you have celiac disease.
85,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty decent bagels, excellent matcha latte"
86,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Disgusting place, disgusting bagels. We waited 45 minutes to get our food. The people next to us waited a while to order food, but no one ever came, so they left. The tables, floor, everything was so dirty! Really disappointing. I went to B&B in Herleen, it was fantastic! Raadhuistraat really ruins the image of the chain!"
87,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Pro coffee tip!
To all the waiters who had been employed here between 11 to 13 months:
Learn the difference between Machiatto and Latte! ‚Ä¶"
88,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I really like the different kinds of bagels they offer here. My favourite bagel is the one with goat cheese and honey. Also the selection of different teas is very good.
89,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Popped in here by chance, nice food and atmosphere and friendly staff."
90,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious and simple - loved the big coffees on our trip last year! Thanks for the vegan options. :) That's what brought us here.
91,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I go to Bagels&Beans a lot, really like the one in Almere, but this particular branch keeps disappointing me! A few months back me and my boyfriend went here but decided to leave after waiting for over 30 minutes without any waiters ‚Ä¶"
92,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious bagels, huge coffees and friendly staff. Nestled in the middle of Amsterdam so super convenient for a bite to eat in between stops."
93,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Great place, do go! You won't regret it, pretty cheap and very tasty."
94,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,8 months ago,I was sitting in the venue for 30min and none of the waiters came. It wasn't even crowded.
95,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I love Bagels&Beans food!! The staff at Raddhuisstraat is amazingly friendly and caring. Thanks for keeping eye in your costumers the hottest days of the year in Amsterdam üòÅ
96,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Currently waiting in this restaurant and although the food might be great we wouldn't know as we have been waiting 45 minutes for our food and haven't even received our drinks yet. We also had to go to find a waitress as nobody came to serve us... Disappointed and will be going elsewhere next time
97,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Very good menu if you are more health conscious than I am, lots of 'super food' seeds and salads on offer with a great choice of bagels, I had the BLT on sesame and was delicious. Worth a try if you are passing on a canal walk."
98,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a franchise operation and bagels & beans are found in several cities in the Netherlands, and several outlets in Amsterdam. This particular outlet could improve customer service, but the basic (common menu) makes a good lunch at an affordable price."
99,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Yes they have gluten free bagels, and very good too. The only downside for me was that they charge for tap water, and I didn't want to buy a drink."
100,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Been eating breakfast here for my entire stay in Amsterdam! Great coffee with an option for soy instead of milk, and their veggie bagels are amazing (I recommend veggie chicken with teriyaki sauce and a cinnamon raisin bagel)"
101,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The salmon and cream cheese bagels with capers and onions are the best I've ever eaten. Coffee is amazing too
102,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Inexperienced but friendly staff, okay coffee and the bagels were a bit stale. They left a table full of dishes dirty for almost one hour."
103,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"This is one of the places I love in Holland. It's not the regular cafe but  a wonderful original place for a selection of bagels dishes, matcha latte, oat drinks etc etc. Fully recommended for being special!"
104,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,10 years ago,"Today we received our bagles and drinks with filthy knives, forks and cups. Because it took long to replace them we started eating using the spoons from the tea and the kids drank from the bottles. Halfway the waitress came with 'clean' ‚Ä¶"
105,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favourite breakfast place. Varieties of bagels, creams, sauces. I can recommend!"
106,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Good vegetarian menu, all is freshly made. We took the mushroom burger and the Salmon bagel.
The deserts weren't very fresh, maybe because it was on a Sunday."
107,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Very slow and rude service. Waited and had to go to the counter otherwise we would have never gotten our food. At least the bagel tasted good.
108,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice lunch room, very friendly and relaxed staff. Not very friendly for wheelchairs or canes. Toilet is downstairs"
109,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious food! The salmon bagel was incredible, everything was so fresh and tasty!"

113,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Delicious bagels and super friendly staff!
114,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,a year ago,Always good. Sun dried tomato cream cheese bagel is the best by far!!
115,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super fresh and nice, big variety to choose from, healthy breakfast in the city almost on every corner! Strawberry cro-muffin is heaven!"
116,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,4 years ago,They have glutem free bagels and vegetarian options. Super tasty wild salmon. It's a little small but the staff is nice and helpful
117,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,9 months ago,As always really good. Loved the glutenfree options.
118,Bagels & Beans, 2 stars ,8 years ago,My bagel was good but minimal. Decoration and atmosphere were lacking. I came here for the wifi. Don't think I'll be back next time I'm in Amsterdam.
119,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The glutenfree bagels are great! It doesn‚Äôt really have the magic athmosphere i‚Äôve seen elsewhere, but in overfall a pretty good place."
120,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Bagels and gluten free bagels are excellent, I had a brunch of vegetarian options (with mushrooms) and it was delicious. Very relaxed atmosphere I'll surely come back here!"
121,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent and friendly staff. Food is solid (not NYC leave bagels but good for Traveller level). Coffee hit the spot.
122,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is good, big portions. Gets too busy and the service is very slow. The bacon in my bagel was cold, needed to return it"
123,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great serves, nice atmosphere and amazing bagels, a bit pricey at times but definitely worth it."

129,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Good as any other of the franchise. Has a nice area outside.
130,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Dirty, not really bagels just bread. But mostly so dirty inside. Menu said our order comes with guacamole, not even g from guac"
131,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Has vegan options, I tried 1 of them, the bagel was crispy and fresh. It was very very good."

133,Bagels & Beans, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The waiter took my drink before I'd finished it & accidently knocked it over onto me in the process. He wasn't particularly apologetic either.

139,Bagels & Beans, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Slow service (30 minutes for drinks, 1 hour for meals), tables very dirty unpleasant boss and forgetting orders: we even for bawled when we ask for orders.... Inacceptable ‚Ä¶"
140,Bagels & Beans, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As usual great cofdee, great cheesecake, great bagels. I am just sorry to see that they don't serve that lunch for two anymore."
141,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,50 pounds for party of 5. Food was delicious but no actual table service.
142,Bagels & Beans, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food but slightly messy service. A little more organisation would be great!
