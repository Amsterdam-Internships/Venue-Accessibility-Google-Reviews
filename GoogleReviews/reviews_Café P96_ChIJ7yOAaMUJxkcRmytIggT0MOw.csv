5,Caf√© P96, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a typically trendy Amsterdam bar serving good beer and good food, made all the better by having it's own barge, made into an outdoor seating area moored up on the canal. Excellent."
6,Caf√© P96, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One block away from the Anne Frank house.  Wonderful people watching with outside patio.  Directly across from the canal- with part of the restaurant sitting on a boat in the canal.  Had a great chicken sandwich with cheese, sauce and guacamole.

We left to find a better place for a lunch. It's a pity, because the prices seemed to be ok and the place looks really nice."
