0,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"I haven‚Äôt had such a  good steak in ages. The staff is friendly, the meat idyllic, the ownera bit grumpy but clearly knows what he‚Äôs doing‚Ä¶. And the price was really honest, not cheap but not too expansive‚Ä¶ you get much more quality than you pay for!"
1,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Apparently it's a family-owned place that has been around for years and sticks very much to traditional dishes; meat-lovers in Amsterdam ought to seek this place out. ‚Ä¶
2,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Stopped by based on a few reviews and had a good feeling about it. I was right. The food was amazing. The appetizers were out of this world. We got the gambas, meatballs, carpaccio, and curry soup. Each was 10/10. The steaks were tender and cooked perfectly. Def making this a frequent stop when I visit Amsterdam."
3,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great steaks here. A must try for anyone visiting Amsterdam. Big like also for the high quality sense of humour of the waiter. You re the best üòâüëç
4,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,6 months ago,I really like restaurants that are not on the main street. The owner really takes pride in his restaurant and I can taste it in the chicken Sate I ate
5,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,3 years ago,House specialty is the horse steak if that‚Äôs your thing. Food was good and the atmosphere was a nice mix of locals and tourists alike. A nice little family run joint. Don‚Äôt order the house wine - it comes from a box.
6,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,They have amazing horse tenderloin and fried  mussel.. I also recommend to try the soup of the day.
7,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Everything was perfect. Horse steak definitely worth a try
8,Piet de Leeuw, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The steaks are competently cooked, but good steak is still steak ‚Äì not remarkably difficult or original. The horse steak is a curiosity item that's actually quite tasty and tender. But in the end it's a generic, forgettable place. Service is... non existent almost."
9,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome traditional Dutch steak house. Really delicious food.
10,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First of all, the food was perfect - we were a bunch of people and we all tried different things, and all of us had only compliments for the food. Staff was also very friendly and helpful and serving was very fast, despite the place being rather crowded."
11,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice food for an OK price. The waiter was nice and friendly, the waitress rather not.
Overall OK to go there. Try the horse tenderloin..."
12,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Brilliant! Excellent service and stellar food! This off-the-beaten-path gem is a must in Amsterdam!
13,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great restaurant off the beaten path. I had the beef and horse combination. First time trying horse steak and I was pleasantly surprised. The Hollandaise sauce they served with the steak was distinctive and excellent. We asked the waitress ‚Ä¶
14,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, nice service, no pretentious stuff. No gimmicks. Famous for their horse steak and rightly so. Good fries and salad etc. Mind you, you can eat fish or even liver with onions as well. Relaxed atmosphere. Always a good bet if you ‚Ä¶"
15,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful place to try an excellent steak with special service! Very relaxed atmosphere. The staff are fun and go out of their way to look after you well. We chose the meatballs & gambas as starters, steak with mushrooms and peppercorn sauce for mains. All cooked to perfection!"

17,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious nice tender meat affordable prices and friendly service
18,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Piet de Leeuw is a lovely place with history and also very Dutch. It is famous for its steaks. But ofcourse there is something else to eat if you want. The staff is really doing their best to make you feel comfortable, And with nice weather you can sit outside also, Piet de Leeuw, still a hidden secret) A no nonsense place)"
19,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic place and great authentic steak! The staff was both helpful and hilarious. A true Dutch culinary experience! My new favourite restaurant in Amsterdam!
20,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I'm an American, horse isn't in our diet.  They had a horse and beef steak dish that allowed me to tell the difference between the two, and it was very well done. ‚Ä¶"
21,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"My experience was horse steak. For a reasonable price, you can try horse steak. It's like beef steak, but really lean. Still tender. The new smell upon my flesh didn't make the local horses any more afraid of me. ‚Ä¶"
22,Piet de Leeuw, 3 stars ,3 months ago,A bit expensive for the quality. I mean total package including beverages
23,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best steak I ever had &super lovable stuff
24,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Genuinely one of the best meals I've hard in Amsterdam. Such a brilliant homely local vibe. The staff are wonderful and not too invasive and always served with a smile. A true hidden gem. I highly recommend this place.
25,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Better than Loetje!
More soul, authentic but kinda worn-out decor and ""gezellig"" busy.
Please note that the standard issue steak is made from horse meat. Matches perfectly with the pepper sauce."
26,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The steaks are really good and the owner very friendly and sometimes very funny. The only negative side was that the cafe got too noisy with a few groups there, making it very difficult to sit and talk during the meal."
27,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Steak was delicious. Warm atmosphere and good service. Only one disadvantage - you need to make a reservation in advance to sit at a separate table (a lot of people), but it is still OK."
28,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lekker, I really liked this Dutch experience and I think is a excellent price-quality relation. The service, time of service, mood and humor is good. Nice atmosphere. Real Dutch experience and really good food."
29,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What a fantastic experience. Food was spot on, tried horse for the first time and was not disappointed. Service was great with waiters having a good sense of humour making you feel welcomed. Will definitely be visiting again!"
30,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Probably the best meal we had in a four day Amsterdam stay, I found the staff a little qurkie but certainly friendlier than all the waiting staff we met subsequently in France!  Steaks and Livers very tasty and a quick Dutch lesson. On balance I would suggest you make the effort to find the place."
31,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Soup of the day (mushroom) is ok, a bit watery. Service is excellent. Steak is good, we were recommended a good sized ‚Ç¨16 steak with pepper sauce. Fries are good, salad a bit saucy."
32,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great cooking and atmosphere. I love the artwork throughout the space: oil portraits with happy locals toasting. Friendly staff. Try the herring on toast followed by the beef tenderloin.
33,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"My boyfriend and I went to this steakhouse around 4:00pm on a weekday.  Surprisingly, it wasn't very busy, only one or two other tables.  We had the full attention of the waiter and he was magnificent! ‚Ä¶"
34,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very kind personnel, excellent food"
35,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Good local place full of locals. Horse meat is the speciality but also other type of meats are excellent. One option for vegetarians available. Atmosphere is full of character with dark wood and low lights. Feels authentic.
36,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Steak here is fantastic. You arrive and check in your coat in a cute ol' timey cloakcupboard, and if you're lucky you get to sit at the bar (with a cushioned arm rest)! They do table service, but bear with them as it might take a few ‚Ä¶"
37,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Somewhat off the beaten track, but well worth finding. Definitely one for lovers of meat, be it horse or cow! Great service,  staff who interact and are very friendly. Even understanding Aussie humor!"
38,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing Dutch food served family style. Definitely try the herring and the horse steak.

40,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,a year ago,I enjoyed the dinner so much. The food was delicious and the service very pleasant. Definitely recommend to visit this place.
41,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Visited here to try the horse, very quiet at lunch time....only two tables in use. However the horse was amazing ....medium rare and melt in the mouth, soup (spinach and Bree) was also amazing"
42,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Has become one of our main goto spots when we are in town. Great food, good service, pretty fair prices compared to many other options. Get the horse, you will not be disappointed."
43,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Great local steak joint. Don't be turned off by the curt attitude of one of the owners, he has a dry sense of humor and is actually quite pleasant. Would definitely go back."
44,Piet de Leeuw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nothing romantic but a true Amsterdam experience if you ask me. Horse steak is the sig dish and it's definitely a chewy one! üê¥ü•©
45,Piet de Leeuw, 1 star ,7 years ago,Extremely unfriendly staff! When we asked for desert they said that they could not serve us because it was their own dinner time and I was embraced in front of my very important guests. Also the horse meat that they claim as their specialty was not really tasty. I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody!!!
46,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,5 years ago,When the meat touched my mouth i had a moment of clearance. I now know exactly why I am no vegetarian. ‚Ä¶
47,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderful food, visited twice on our short break to Amsterdam, so good we will be back next time"

50,Piet de Leeuw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Pleasantly brusque, brutally friendly, the staff captures an Amsterdam spirit difficult to find in these globalized hipsterized days. The best (horse) steaks anywhere."
