0,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,a month ago,"It says on the window the best burgers and after trying them I have to whole heartedly agree,  the 250 with old amsterdam cheese and mayo was superb."
1,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"The burgers in this place are top notch, everything is well cooked. You really do get a full plate, excellent value for the money"
2,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"A very genuine burger, we were very impressed. The service was also great. The fried egg was also done properly. The fries to die for, not the usual type. If they had sweet potato fries it would have been heaven for me but definitely we will come back. Good value for money!"
3,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"18 sept 2021: Fantastic burger- tasty, moist, full of flavour, hot and fresh. I'll recommend Burger Zaken to my all my friends. Well done guys."
4,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Burger was delicious. The guys making the burgers were really nice. They told me to follow them on Instagram. Check out my burger. The bueger already comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and their homemade burger sauce. I added pineapple, cheddar cheese, and ketchup sauce."
5,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good vegetarian burger! The price is affordable, and the portions are huge! The place may be a little small, but the food was great."
6,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Happened upon here randomly, truth be told the very reasonable prices drew us in. ‚Ç¨20 for two burgers, a topping, shared fries and a drink each. ‚Ä¶"
7,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,5 months ago,Really terrible service. Disrespectful and just plain rude. Typical Dutch.. But I wouldn't recommend for a second! Just gross in every way
8,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Not bad, although there was an ant on my dish üòÖ"
9,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I will say burguers are ok, they are big, I tried the Angus beef and it's good. Prices are normal, everything is a topping (sauces, bacon, cheese, mushrooms, etc) Basic is only Meat, lettuce and pickles. ‚Ä¶"
10,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Probably the tastiest burger I have ever had! We ordered two Black Angus Beef Burgers with fries and it was just simply amazing. Definitely worth a visit when coming to Amsterdam!
11,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great burgers but chips where a bit too salty for me to fully enjoy.
12,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Staff is great and super fast even when its super crowded !! Its a place for a burger lovers where you can make a burger choosing what ever you want!! This place is super super popular for a local ppl so dont expect low quality fast ‚Ä¶
13,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Not so Good  The burger was dry and The bun didn't feel fresh
14,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Don't say that you have a veggie burger on your menu, when you are selling this soggy contraption of an excuse as a 'veggie' patty. Your server said that ""the menu says it would be medium rare"". Are you kidding me? what does that even mean ‚Ä¶"
15,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Build your own burger. Great quality succulent meat and chicken, ok price."
16,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Good and reasonably priced place for a burger fix

22,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great burgers served instantly. Cozy place to have a snack. Totally recommend.
23,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,üçî Amazing burgers! As always
24,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Kind of average for me. Nothing special about the burger- not amazing, not bad. The thing that bothered me was mostly that fries didnt come with the burger and that mayo/ketchup did not come with neither fries nor burger and I had to pay ‚Ä¶"
25,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible place! Avoid! Burger was on a huge bun with little meat inside and baked onions weren‚Äôt baked at all. The waiter who more looks like a mafia  goon was very rude! Garlic sauce wasn‚Äôt garlic sauce.. fries were cheap frozen fries. Overpriced! Definitely not the best burger in town as advertised on the window üòÇ
26,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A little pricy for the food you get. Fries are goodish but mine were over fried. Burger was fine, not great. Overall feel of the place was.... needs some refresh. Typical place for late party goers."
27,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Decent burger. Very fast service!
28,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing burger, cooked in front of us with everything customisable. Great value and one of the best burgers I have ever had! Big fat juicy tasty burger!"
29,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,2 years ago,"One of the waiters was the rudest waiter I think I have ever encountered. Maybe he is sick of foreigners? Everyone else I gave my business too was incredibly polite though. Maybe the dude was just having a bad day? Anyway, we smiled and ‚Ä¶"
30,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,2 years ago,I love burgers. It appears this place doesn't share this passion. We came here famished for a late dinner and it did not deliver. Bread tasted stale. Patties are dry and tasteless. Even their fries are average and strangely chewy. It's a shame we wasted one of three dinners in Amsterdam here.
31,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"English-speaking stuff, nice and smiling, really fast service, everything freshly made. Place is a bit small, but worth waiting for a table ;)"
32,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The burger itself was good, however, the service was slow. We had to ask for the bill 3 times. They also refused to serve me a glass of tap water simply to increase profits. They also charged extra for ketchup which again left a sour taste, ‚Ä¶"
33,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,3 years ago,When we first arrived we were greeted by a kind young man with blonde/light brown hair. He was very polite and help throughout our whole stay. The other man (bald) we found to be very rude and made us feel very uncomfortable. We waited in ‚Ä¶
34,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Absolutely Terrible Service.

Made us pay for a coffee that we didn't want. ‚Ä¶"
35,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great homemade burgers in the heart of the redlight district. The place I believe closes at 1am so it's a great place to grab a late night bite if you're out and about in the area. I had the angus beef burger along with fries and would ‚Ä¶
36,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"When I'm paying 10 euros for a burger (fries not included) I expect the beef burger to be hand made and not some processed frozen burger. The dressing was terrible, minimal lettuce, one slice of pickle. Dry burger and dry fries, service is ‚Ä¶"
37,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good burgers! You can pretty much ask how you want it (every ingredient). Although is small and compact, but is a good place to go if you are not waiting to spend a long time there. Also in a good centric location."
38,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Probably won't eat here again. Fries were good, but the burgers was very meh. I describe the burgers as ""meh"", not much in the way of flavour, or moneys worth. We had a chicken burger, and a vegetarian burger - the vege pattie was like mooshy paste. Not nice!"
39,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It's a decent burger not too crazy, not bad. Bread could be a bit crisper. Price is probably from being in the middle of the city. Its OK for a stop but wouldn't go here on a regular basis"
40,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The burgers were overcooked and the onions were undercooked. (maybe well done is their default) It‚Äôs absuletly not a bad place though. I would recommend it you just have to ask for medium/rare meat.
41,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,4 years ago,I‚Äôm of the opinion that manners cost nothing. Unfortunately for the staff of Burger Zaken it appears they cost more than ‚Ç¨37.50 - as I didn‚Äôt see any included in the price during my recent visit. ‚Ä¶
42,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,3 years ago,"A total DISAPPOINTMENT at this place. It was the second time I would come there and decided to repeat with some friends. Nevertheless, it was such TERRIBLE experience, the waiter got very aggressive to us, did not pay respect to the other ‚Ä¶"
43,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Enjoyed the large Wagyu burger and fries. Cooked how you want and with whatever you like on the bun.   Small pokey shop with friendly staff. My second visit and would definitely go again.
44,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Dissappointing experience. We were looking for a quick bite before going to the movies and decided to give Burger Zaken a go. First of all we were told there was no plate service, as mentioned on the menu. When we ordered a burger with ‚Ä¶"
45,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Beef is fresh and good, however the staff is highly unfriendly and the toppings doesn't show great taste. On top of that, they keep the front door opened in winter and we're freezing while eating. Don't stop here unless you absolutely need to :("
46,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great burgers, although quite expensive.
Service was ok."
47,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The hamburgers was super delicious like always, but the young guy in the kitchen has long hair and sweat in his face and touching his hair or face every 2 minutes and shake his head in the middel of the small kitchen and our plates was there. I do not like this."
48,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really taste veggie burger, large size and very cheap! My bro got a 250g beef burger and it was huge. Lovely staff too!"
49,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great burger! Some might enjoy the multitude of options, but for me it was too much. You are able to customize your burger exactly the way you want to though."
50,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely and cosy place. Friendly staff. Big burgers that really tastes good. Definitely will go there again.
51,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Good burgers for a fair price. This place gives you the freedom to choose your own toppings on each hamburger. Service was fine
52,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Burger is really fine, good and tasty! But service is the worst is Amsterdam. Beware of manager when he is at cash desk! if he's angry, you'd better look for another fast food."
53,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice,more then one kind of Beef.
You got the Choice üëä
For me one of my Top 10 Burger in Germany. ‚Ä¶"
54,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Hamburguer really dry, not juicy at all, dont come, not worth it"
55,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Store claims to be the ‚Äûbest‚Äú in Amsterdam but is far from it. Burger includes lettuce, tomato and sauce. What that mean? 1 tomato slice, a tiny piece of lettuce. Only the meat is okay that‚Äôs why 2 stars instead of 1."
56,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,3 years ago,I wish I could give it no stars. No tap water. Chicken patty in burger  tastes like a soya vegan patty. Avocado spread for 1.15 euros was like one whiff of a butter knife. Pathetic. Wish I just bought 2 bananas and drank alot of water to ‚Ä¶
57,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely delicious, first day in Amsterdam and we stumbled across this place! Staff are great food is incredible. Will definitely be returning before we leave. Thanks guys!"
58,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Rude staff,no silvareware available,burger house that charges ‚Ç¨0,50 for red sauce is a joke. definitely do not recomend it.for the same price go mackies or something and will be a far better experience."
59,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible experience. One of the staff was incredibly rude and arrogant with a threatening attitude all the time. I ordered one burger and they gave me a different one. Not good food either. I definetely not recommend it at all.
60,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,2 years ago,"No respect of priorities to serve, the chicken is not real chicken, is a mix and it's sucks. This place makes bad food and I don't recommended this place. And this is not the best burger of the town. I won't come back, never."
61,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,4 years ago,The worst service we EVER had! Avoid this place as its run by thugs and ex gangsters!!! Burgers were ok. We ordered water the rudest waitress bought us pair of filthy glasses which we pointed out to her. She told us that the glasses are not ‚Ä¶
62,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,In the center of Amsterdam. Small and cozy. Open kitchen. Fast service. Very good taste
63,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Dishonest place. Very shameful. I requested a refund because I had been served a burger without cheese (and I had paid for cheese). The person working there refused at first, then gave me a fake 1euro coin!!!! When I realised it was a fake ‚Ä¶"
64,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I came with some friends but it was a terrible experience. The service was very unfriendly as well as unhelpfully. Burgers are not vey tasty, therefore I don't recommend this place at all."

66,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Price for burgers is good for the center of the city. Staff is a little rude. You can wait for order for a while in busy hours.
67,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Good quality burgers, the real deal. Good French fries. Only improvement recommendation, skip the English style bacon and switch to crispy American style."
68,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"""I came into this restaurant just strolling the streets looking for something casual and reminded me of food back home in the USA. The burger was great, the atmosphere was clean and lively. Decent prices too!"" - Ansel Ponce Diama"
69,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I still prefer this place to the one around the corner next to Oude Kerk. It's super tiny, so it's not easy to find a place in the touristy season. Expect to leave the place smelling like a burger. ‚Ä¶"
70,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent burger! Have been satisfied with my food after many visits. Would sincerely recommend to anyone.
71,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Burger meat is good, but not melt in your mouth good. Fries are too hard. They ran out of tea and would not offer tap water"
72,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was really delicious, but the service was pretty terrible. They just forgot about my order until I asked and then they scrambled to make it. Then I ordered fries and they forgot me again!! Oh well, street food in Amsterdam...."
73,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I normally get a simple burger which for 5.25‚Ç¨ is one of the most reasonable quick meal for the city centre of Amsterdam. You will feel full for a while, nice portions."
74,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Clean, cozy, one of the best burgers in town.
A little bit small and crowded, not cheap but it's totally worth it!"
75,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great service.  Great burger and fries.  It's ala carte, so add onions.. a buck more.  Add cheese... a buck more... etc.  The burger is plenty big without extras."
76,Burger Zaken, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The burgers were surprisingly excellent. Didn't realize this was a chain, did not taste like chain food. A go to destination for me now when I'm in Amsterdam."
77,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,4 years ago,A place to get a quick bite. Very busy and service was not amazing. The hamburgers were okay priced but the toppings were quite over priced.
78,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good burger, but my own buns are better üòâ cola is ok, fries are OK, but not as good as the ones from the other woman at Waterlooplein"
79,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Have a MICE day. at least 2 mice run through the kitchens restaurant. the personnel only stated: ""so what - the door is open"". the burger was okay - but now i always think about mice flesh while eating burgers. ugh!"

82,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The Wagyu beef burger was really good. There location of this one was extra small (not much seating) being in the heart of Centrum.
83,Burger Zaken, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Bad veggy burger...the side dishes were OK.
Chicken burger seems frozen. Sauces not requested added on the food. Dishes Served fast"
84,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,4 years ago,"When it comes to prices - well,  don't expect anything cheap near Dam Square, it's made to be a little rip off. Actually it is, so would say this place is more for those who don't mind that.  But my 2 cents mainly goes to management, who ‚Ä¶"
85,Burger Zaken, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Meat was overcooked and kind of dry. Bun was meh. Rather mediocre effort, especially considering they boast to have the ""best burger in town"" on the window."
86,Burger Zaken, 1 star ,3 years ago,Horrible customer service. Bought a burger and a drink and asked if my water bottles could be filled with tap water as it was a 37 degree heat day. He refused to fill them and also did not allow us to sit outside the shop bench as not all of us purchased food from the shop.
87,Burger Zaken, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I tried the vegetarian burger and it‚Äôs good.
Nothing special though.
