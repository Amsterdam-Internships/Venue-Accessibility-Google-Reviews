0,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"My review is based on YoYo! Milk tea (4,40€/large) and Lemongrass Cooler (4,90€/large). The milk tea was a bit disappointing, the taste was too mild to be authentic bubble milk tea. I have drank a lot in Taiwan and many other countries and …"
1,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Best jasmin milk tea. But I also recommend other flavours.
There's usually a big queue, but it's worth the wait. You can buy there also their tea, metal water bottles, cups, cute things, t-shirts, games etc. …"
2,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,5 months ago,I love the Matcha latte tea. I tried other ones but this one is my favourite.
3,Yo yo!, 1 star ,5 months ago,"I was in today (25.09) around 7:32 pm and ordered one bubble tea green jasmine pure tea. I stood the whole time in front of the counter to receive the tea. I only got it after 20 minutes. When I asked why it took so long, the staff told me …"
4,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great bubble tea, good options, and the self-service order in store is clutch! Worth the stop for a sweet drink"
5,Yo yo!, 1 star ,2 years ago,There was a long queue and we were excited to try out. We ordered the classic milk tea with tapioca. Omg the taste was awful! The tea had a gingery hint which was a bit disgusting. The tapioca was also tasteless. Arhhh ... It was truly a nightmare. Really disappointed.
6,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Although a franchise/chain bubble tea bar, I really enjoy the superior customer service in this store and the others I've visited.  The quality control in every YoYo! Fresh Tea Bar store is on-point. I find this bubble tea is the most …"
7,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Really loved this place and their bubble tea. But it's often too crowded and the place is heavily understaffed and/or tge process is not well streamlined. It was really slow, and the drinks were prepared really slow as well."
8,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of my favorites brand for bubble tea. Lots of people there but they work very fast. Good if  anyone want to try.
9,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The milk tea was average.  We ordered green jasmine milk tea but the tea flavor wasn’t strong enough.  Service was very pleasant.
10,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the better bubble tea outlet, with the option to adjust sugar level (a score for a less sugar lover like us). Went with yo-yo earl grey tea with tapioca pearls. Tea was very fragrant with a bit of bitter aftertaste. Pearls were sweetened to the perfect state! Lovely!"
11,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"If u want good bubble tea for an affordable price, then this is the right place to be!"
12,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The place itself is super cute.
But my bubble tea didn't tasted matcha with soya milk at all.
They put too little free topping, is really just a little bit of tapioca that …"
13,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best bubble tea in town. Expect long queue and young crowd.
14,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Obviously not totally authentic, but it's probably one of the better places and has much more decent prices for what you get compared to other bubble tea shops."
15,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly people. Drinks are nice and a fun store. Only recommendation to them is more sitting space, but not enough to take a star off."
16,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,7 months ago,The lychee flavoured green tea itself didn't taste too bad but the popping boba was a disappointment - very small in size and way too chewy. Not worth the money.
17,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best Milk tea in red light district Amsterdam... My favorit is Taro Milk Tea and Yakult also the best.. recommended. U can find also pandan cake here so yummy delicious..soft and nice smell tho
18,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Yoyo! Is the spot for me and my friends to hang out while drinking good bubble tea. Friendly employees and they also sell other cute items like bento boxes or asian magazines. …
19,Yo yo!, 1 star ,2 years ago,"That’s so called large size...I paid for large, but only got medium. Even medium size cups can’t be fulfilled by these poor milk tea..."
20,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good to have a bubble tea after meal. But the taste is not as good as in Taiwan
21,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,I really love going to this place even when I live quite a distance from it. I brought my friends here to try boba for the first time and they fell in love just as I did. Though the brown sugar milk tea wasn't really my favorite because of …
22,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,This bubble tea bar has some refreshing items on the menuboard! When you are walking around the china town in Amsterdam be sure to check into this place.  The taste is off course not as great as in Asia establishments but for a quick drink …
23,Yo yo!, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ordered taro milk tea, but it tasted like water and had no flavour. Asked for more powder and the store said ""it is supposed to taste like this""  never buying again, highly not recommended"
24,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Going to YoYo! For tea or etc is always a safe bet.
They deliver their quality all the time, and therefore, when I don’t want to risk a new bubble tea place, I always go for YoYo!."
25,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very tasty and well located.
The down side is the waiting time, the process could be reduced to less than half of the time that currently takes. One star less because of that."
26,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"This chain is my preferred for bubble tea in the Netherlands. The Taro coconut milk with tapioca as either a hot or cold beverage is my favorite.
The strawberry tea with any of the popping toppings is a close second when I …"
27,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Customer service fluctuates, prices are a bit high, yet the drinks are very delicious!"
28,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,a year ago,Been here several times but the flavor of the bubble-teas are mediocre. The quality and taste used to be better when the place just opened up. Now because of the tiktok hype the quality and service has gotten bad in my opinion.
29,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice shop bubble tea was good quality.
30,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Best boba tea I’ve ever tasted. There is plenty of variations to choose from so if you are particular there is something for you. Spent 2 days in Amsterdam and went 3 times. Definitely worth visiting if you’re in the area and is really worth the money!
31,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,a year ago,"new in town and wanted bubble tea as i live in china many years, this place drinks is tasteless, i make the same drink with syrup from supermarket. Also i didnt feel welcome at all, staff very bad: will go elsewhere next time, still on the hunt for good bubble tea"
32,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best bubble tea I’ve had in Amsterdam, the queue goes around the block, I’ve once waited an hour for a bubble tea from here. Not as expensive as others in the city and tastes much nicer. See ya in a couple of days"
33,Yo yo!, 1 star ,a year ago,"If you know what a real bubble tea is, avoid this place. Bubble tea's barely have flavour, they taste like water. I recommend this place only if you are ready to pay for a fresh drink and don't expect too much from the taste."
34,Yo yo!, 1 star ,9 months ago,"this boba Milk tea I had didn't tasted as genuine, real milk tea and also the boba they give is so little, you pay a good price for your product, oh another thing the paper straw, they suck, what is the point if the plastic cup and lid are the same.?"
35,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely bubble tea place. I ordered the black tea lime with green apple popping balls (first time I ever saw the green tea flavor popping balls anywhere, really). It was really yummy. There's also a small shop inside that sells cute things …"
36,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"No tapioka bubles...heey its the major toping how can you run out :(

Next day, they hold the word and I could enjoy all the tapioka bubbles :)"
37,Yo yo!, 1 star ,a year ago,"Not fresh, nor yummy. If you know what real bubble tea is supposed to taste like, I’d suggest you stay away from this place! They also still create an incredible amount of plastic waste... it’s 2020 guys!"
38,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Im very disappointed, my brother brought me a tea from YOYO, I like it but this time I got it but there was only the drink in it there is no “bubbles”they call it Tapioca, these rounded shape tasty things and it has happened before as well…"
39,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best place to get the best tapioca in the Netherlands. And all the drinks all really nice. It's not too sweet and has a nice taste. Me and my friends come here really often. And so do other people.
40,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"That place looks nice, staff is super friendly and prices are ""normal"" by European standards. However, the tea had a very synthetic taste (as a regular tea drinker, I highly doubt that was a ""fresh Jasmin tea"" as advertised. During our visit the store was also out of Tapioka... Which, for a bubble tea should be avoided by any means."
41,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Was craving for a bubble tea whilst on holiday in Amsterdam, found this place and it's pretty good. I always get fruit teas (lychee black tea) and it was good here. The shop is cute, they have some random cute things for sale from kitchen ware to accessories, and a small clothing range upstairs."
42,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great staff, great service, great bubble tea. Sometimes there's quite a large queue and your drink can take a while to arrive, but it's always worth the wait. I recommend the green tea passionfruit flavour with green apple poppings."
43,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Got a great tip from the cashier, my new fave is the strawberry tea.  It's the only boba place in Amsterdam, far as I can tell, and they close early so plan ahead.  Process are responsible and the drinks are pretty good.  Awesome staff"
44,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great bubble tea, awesome accessoires fpr sale too. Nice staff and plenty of choice. Only downsides are that there are nit a lot of vegan options and the existing drinks are not customisable, so you gotta order a custom drink from scratch if you want to skip one ingredient."
45,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Bubble tea store in Amsterdam. Staff are friendly and quick. The prices are very fair and the accessories and gifts they sell are quirky and unique. I had the Mango Green Tea and Lychee Jelly as toppings. Amazing! Love that you can personalise the drinks. They accept card which is useful. Definitely returning!!!
46,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The Tea here is really tasty and sweet like something out of a unicorn universe. The store is located in a beautiful street so when you are standing in line you can look through the windows and see some nice things. Although the straws are not organic they still do their job.
47,Yo yo!, 1 star ,a year ago,"The tea is good.
Unfortunately they treated me poorly. Place closes at 19:00, I arrived at 18:47 and they didn't let me order, after telling them I left the house and walked 15min just for their tea."
48,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"there has lots of topping and taste.
It is very similar taiwan ’s thing.
And all of staff is so kind."
49,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Cutesy shop that sells gift ware, bobas were nice, I had the classic milk tea with pearls. Was about 4,5€ for a medium which is average priced for Amsterdam. In all, I would go back!"
50,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Best bubble tea in town
51,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The bubble tea is very good as usual. I have to praise their good service. I ordered egg waffle. I was told that it would take 6 minutes to make. After I have waited for 15 mins, I checked with them again. It seemed that they have forgotten …"
52,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Super nice people, lovely shop and although the queue was quite long, you don't have to wait in line that long, but... the bubbletea is okayish. The tapioca was a bit hard and chewy instead of bouncy and yummy. And the coffee flavored syrup in my Tiramisu Latte was overpowering the flavor of the actual espresso."
53,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"With the rise of bubble tea, I half expected there to be a place serving it in Amsterdam’s Chinatown. I decided to assess them on the signature YoYo! milk tea. It has a Earl Grey base and I chose tapioca for a topping. I think they could …"
54,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The price rages are around
Small       3,20€
Medium  3,70€
Large      4,20€"
55,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Not the best bubble tea... I wish they had more sugar in the drink (I already asked for regular sugar with no ice). The taste of the milk needs to be stronger and the tapioca bubble does taste very plain.
56,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great tea, great customer service, I go here every friday with my friends - and it's awesome! However, a bit overprised sometimes, but you get exactly what you pay for - a delicious bubble tea!"
57,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious tea, with many options to customize! Tea does not take long to make so you won't get stuck in the waiting line for long at all. One of my favorite places to come to in Amsterdam!"
58,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,3 years ago,I really really wish they had coconut or almond milk. Only offering soy as a substitute is quite limiting. The syrups seem a bit too sweet and overpower the tea flavor as well. Really nice store though. I love the post cards and knick knacks they sell
59,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I get bubble tea from this place a lot and am satisfied most of the times. I don’t know what happened but the last few times I got the drinks the tapioca were really soft and mushy and it was kind of disgusting. Too bad, now I have to think twice before getting bubble tea because I don’t want to waste my money."
60,Yo yo!, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I went to get a green tea with tapioca and I didn’t want any sugar in it. I saw how the Tea and syrups were separated and even thought asked the guy many times to please not add any syrups, he kept saying that was impossible to sell me the …"
61,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Favoritw place to stop by when I'm in Amsterdam. Love that they have a saving points card which will enable you to get a free bubble tea once fully stamped. My favorite bubble tea is the Jasmin milk tea with soy milk and tapioca pearls! Delicious! Less sugar options also available as well as longs of fruit tea options.
62,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place, however they don't allow you to ask for extra sugar, or extra ice (even if everybody know that the tea taste like water). I was also asking whether I can change the milk to soy milk and it wasn't allowed. My friend on the other way around ask for her Matcha tea to use normal milk instead of soy milk, also not allowed."
63,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,9 months ago,They put way too much ice.
64,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent bubble tea and plenty of other weird interesting drink/snack choices
65,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,My go to bubble tea store in Amsterdam. Nice and cols drink on a hot summer day. Would recommend ordering without ice cubes if you're not going to drink the tea right away!
66,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Had a milk tea with tapioca. Speaking as a Taiwanese American who's had a lot of bubble teas before, the drink was good but not great. Price was rather high too. Will visit again because YoYo! is one of the very few bubble tea shops in Amsterdam and so I'm a captive customer."
67,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"I have ordered thousands of times and there is no doubt that their drinks are tasty, but the staffs did not only one time that forgetting putting sugar, so this command is for their careless."
68,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Vibrant and full of color. It is not a new thing of drinks, some food and gift articles to buy but they did it with taste. I can say that you can go there to have a drink while thinking what to buy for your next birthday party that you're going to. The place can get crowded but so it on plenty of stores in that street."
69,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice bubble tea bar, with some good tasting teas. A larger variety of toppings would be nice. If there is a queue you'll have to wait on the street since the shop is not large enough"
70,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"What I really like about this place is the fact that you can choose how sweet you want your beverage, whether you want it hot or cold, and the general atmosphere. You can hang out there and buy gifts/souvenirs as well. The employees are also very friendly and I have never seen one of them frown one bit. I love you Yoyo"
71,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Their bubble tea is alright, I prefer other bubble tea shops in Amsterdam. I'm not really a fan of the staff. They are not very friendly."
72,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,a year ago,Bubble tea tasted weird. Gritty bits in the jasmine milk tea and pearls were tasteless. There are better ones! Price was okay.
73,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best bubble tea I've ever drunken! SOOOO DELICIOUS! And the music playing there was delightful as well! Moderate prices! I was really happy with my bubble tea
74,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place for tea & coffee lovers. You will not only find teas n coffees here but also things required to make them as well. If you love tea or coffee n you happen to be in leiden, then it is a must visit."
75,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Love this place. They serve this amazing tea with different bases and flavors. The bubbles inside give the tea a fun little touch.
76,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Was so happy that they sell tea with yakult but it was really disappointing. Didn’t taste the yakult at all. Even the tea taste more like water.
One friend ordered another tea... very bad. Only the Hong Kong Milk Tea was alright."
77,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite place to chill, they have a lot of varity in bubble tea. The service is really good and the employees are really nice and you could just have a small conversastion with them. I bought a couple of stuff from the store as …"
78,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely Boba and really sweet staff l, my only issue is the fact that it's always crowded and there's no arrangement for seating while waiting
There was also someone ahead of us that ordered 9 bobas in one go so he held up …"
79,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ordered taro milk tea but hardly any taro or milk tea taste. Tasted like very diluted milk. The tapioca pearls were nice though shame about the drink.
80,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cute interior, nice choices of bubble tea!"
81,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Nice bubble tea, cute gifts to purchase
But expensive but that's to be expected"
82,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want some legit Hong Kong milk tea in Amsterdam then this is the place to be. I either get the classic with tapioca, jasmin, or even taro. All great stuff! Brings me back to my exchange student days in Hong Kong. :D"
83,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best bubble tea place in Amsterdam. They call the hong kong milk tea ""yoyo milk tea"". Also all the cute little stuff they sell here is really adding to the atmosphere. Ranges from korean face masks to sushi-themed socks. There are even few chairs so you can drink your bubble tea inside aswell on cold days. Would definitely recommend."
84,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Best bubble tea I have found so far in Amsterdam. - I recommend the warm ginger tea or lychee green tea with lychee jelly.
I come here 1-2 times per week for my bubble tea fix and enjoy sitting by the …"
85,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,a year ago,I don't understand why people don't like it. I never waited more then 10 minutes and the taste is good.  The only thing I don't like is that many stuff is sold out at about 3 pm.
86,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"the best boba I have ever had in Europe

tapioca pearls were the correct consistency and slightly sweet …"
87,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Delicious boba tea and adorable gift ideas. This place is always clean and well lit, the waits are short for your tea, and there's a little loft where you can enjoy your tea."
88,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I love bubble tea and I love yoyo.
It used to be my favourite place to hangout but now that they have changed from fresh milk to powder milk I am unsatisfied with the flavour I taste..."
89,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"the bubble tea is too sweet and the shop doesn't allow you to customize.... more over, they use the Earl Grey tea as the base to make bubble tea, that's not the traditional receipt....."
90,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Nicely decorated confy place. The bubble tea is great. I like the fact they also have other things for sell like nanoblock sets. One of my favorites in Amsterdam.
91,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,5 years ago,A little expensive comparing to other cities. It like milk tea in Taiwan but the pearl is not as good.
92,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A bit of a waiting time, but the bubble tea was worth it. I had the Yoyo Milk Tea, maybe not as sweet as some people may prefer but it was perfect for my taste!"
93,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"As a Taiwanese person, I know my bubble tea and most that I’ve had in Europe are just meh. This one is different, very nice tea blend and well cooked bubbles. Only probs."
94,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Wow, being from San Francisco where there's a decent selection of good boba, I was pleasantly surprised when I tried YOyo!  Looks like a chain or franchise.  Balls are a bit smaller than what I'm used to and you can adjust sweetness and ice level.   No toilet for customers."
95,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A victim of its own success. Always a queue, and the manager is rude af, but the taste is addictive. If there was any competition I would immediately go there, but there isn't, so I'm stuck with this."
96,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Aside from the long lines that tend to form outside every so often, the bubble tea is amazing. I recommend taro milk tea (cold) with tapioka!"
97,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I drink most of flavours, It is ok, not my cup of tea, except chocolate milk tea. I like it."
98,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,a year ago,Decent bubble tea ! Their spice milk tea was the best I have tasted ever and a must try
99,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Maybe the only boba place you can find in Amsterdam 😁 not bad, the tea is refreshing. Looking forward to visit this place more on summer days."
100,Yo yo!, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Apparently the ""coconut milk"" in the taro coconut milk stands for coconut flavoured cowsmilk instead of just actual coconut milk. Not a fun thing to find out after having one when you're lactose intolerant."
101,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Everything was great, but I'd like to see seats somewhere. Other than that, it's a good place to get your drinks."
102,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great bubble tea, tapioca pearls were awesome. There is some seating in the shop, it's very convenient."
103,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Lovely service. Great drinks. Good gadgets
104,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This fresh tea bar offers hip urban drinks based on traditional chinese tea. Also a place to buy modern desgn presents. creative souvenirs and gifts.
105,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,a year ago,Tasty milktea but wait is always very very long. Larger variety of drinks and toppings are needed.
106,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,7 months ago,This is what annoying in Amsterdam that staff of shops are not speaking Dutch at all or not even making an effort.
107,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Im in Love with the YoYo 😅🎶🍵

(Their YoYo Bubble tea, the Green Yasmine Milk tea with boba is also delish!!!)"
108,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favourite bubble tea bar in the country! The gift shop is also adorable, don’t forget to check it out!"
109,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It’s totally different (the bubble) than the traditional bubble tea in Taiwan, but I like it!"
110,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Ugh, I love the bubble tea so much! Everytime I visit Amsterdam I go here. Amazing prices and quality, love it!"
111,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The bubbletea is great, it's a bit small but there's a few cosy corners where you can sit with friends. People usually don't stay there so there's usually room to sit aswell."
112,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great bubble tea, but very busy and long queue. Might be good if they invest in a bigger venue"
113,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great bubble tea here. The earl grey milk tea was amazing and affordable as well. Recommended!
114,Yo yo!, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Stingy with tapioca and tea. Ordered a small, tea wasn’t filled to the top and bobas were lacking in quantity, as if they are rationing their original bobas."
115,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Such a cute shop with a lot of asian inspired items that you can buy and some Kpop merch. The bubble tea is delicious!
116,Yo yo!, 1 star ,a year ago,When I saw the huge line of people I expected something special. This wasn't the case. It's just sugary tea with bubbles. Unfortunately the staff were a bit rude too    making this place one I won't come back to.
117,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Taro coconut milk tea is my favourite.
Very cute little shop. Very fast staff and cool drinks"
118,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,The BEST and the FIRST bubble/bobba tea I've tried in my life. And i want more!
119,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The last bubbletea. It is one reason to travel to Amsterdam. While waiting for your drink you can buy nice stuff in there. Bubbletea is tasty.
120,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I tried a taro bubble tea and it was simply delicious! The staff is friendly too and the shop is cute.
121,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I found this place to be pricey for both drinks and especially the goods sold here but doesn't change the fact it's cute. Bubble tea is not a ""must"" but a shot can be given for sure."
122,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great flavors. Just the best bubble tea spot in Amstedam
123,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Lovely! Who knew that Earl grey would go so well with taro bubble tea! Tapioca was the best I've had too!
124,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,"If you're new to YoYo, try taro coconut. It tastes amazing"
125,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Bubble teas are great and the place is nice. I have nothing more to say! It was perfect!
126,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great bubble tea for the price. It is really cheap and you get a big drink for the prices!
127,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My girlfriend basically got me hooked on the place not too long ago. If bubble tea is your thing, they got you covered in spades."
128,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Bubbletea is great here and the stamp card is awesome. You can save up for a free medium bubbletea
129,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Interesting store for bubble tea and other accessoires but the taste I will say its acceptable but nothing fancy as a tourist......
130,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Love the interior and the merchandise you can purchase at the shop! My favorite drink is still Taro coconut ;)
131,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Fun cute tea bar. My first bubble tea experience was in YoYo! and it was a pleasant one for sure.
132,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It's a very cute tea bar. They have alot of selections when it comes to tea. The shop itself has some amazing goodies
133,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Beautiful shop and adorable/friendly employees! I tried a boba milk tea and it was AMAZING
134,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A good variety of options and Hong Kong egg waffles make it worth the wait in line that sometimes stretches to outside of the store.
135,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Not bad, its taste was special compared to chatime bubble tea. First sip was weird but it grows on u"
136,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Milk tea was too sweet and no efficiency in the kitchen even there are lots people working.
137,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love tea, love bubbles.. so Making your own combinations 😱😳 best invention ever!!"
138,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite drinks, unique icetea with a sort of jelly popping balls including syrup with sour apple and mango taste."
139,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing place, can buy really cool gadgets and items while sipping on some delicious tea."
140,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious drinks. But remember - they don't take cash due to the Covid-19!
141,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,a year ago,Pretty long wait but the drinks were up to expectations.
142,Yo yo!, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good bubble tea options, fast service and cute merchandise available in store."
143,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great tasting bubble tea, staff is very friendly. Great experience overall."
144,Yo yo!, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best chai latte — with real spices — anise seeds and cinnamon stick!
145,Yo yo!, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Very crowded. We had to spend 20 minutes there. Otherwise the flavors are great
