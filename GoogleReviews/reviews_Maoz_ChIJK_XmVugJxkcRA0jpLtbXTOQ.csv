29,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fabulous food. Cheap, cheerful."
30,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This place has the most amazing falafels in Amsterdam. It has a much novel concept than other food joints, where the server just serves you the falafels in the bread and we are free to choose any toppings and sauces. This was one of my most delightful experience of a falafel. The staff is also really really nice."
31,Maoz, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great! Love the food. The staff was very helpful explaining all the additional topping choices. Honest animal friendly lovely food!

I only tried the small falafel for 4,95‚Ç¨ but it was worth it. It is made with ‚Ä¶"
34,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Fresh Vegan lunch spot. Delicious Falafel pockets surg lots of salad. Also had their fries with hot sauce and garlic sauce. Garlic sauce is spot on. Actual Fries themselves however taste like they are fried from frozen, not authentic Amsterdam fries. Falafels are fresh and crispy for which I'm giving an extra star. Quick service."
35,Maoz, 1 star ,a year ago,Charged me for a regular pita and refused to give it to me. Instead they gave me a small even though i told them i ordered regular. They dont give receipts so its impossible to show them. They touch the bread with their hands. Dont ask if ‚Ä¶
36,Maoz, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I ordered some french fries and saw the guy put the old already fried fries from the previous customer in the deep frier. When he handed them to me I asked for fresh fries to which he snapped at me ‚Äûthey‚Äôre fresh, everybody gets the same here‚Äú. He threw them in the bin and gave me my money back. No fries for me. What an idiot."
37,Maoz, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great vegan food, I like that you can pick vegetables/salads by yourself like a buffet."
38,Maoz, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Tasty and affordable unlike the rest of Amsterdam sadly
39,Maoz, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was ok.  I liked my meal, but there was no sneeze guard, so the fix your own salad bar was a bit scary to use.  I like the Maoz in SOHO London & in Berkeley, CA. better."

42,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,2nd best falafel I‚Äôve had in Europe. First one was in Paris. This place really gives you your money‚Äôs worth. And it‚Äôs cheap! They basically give you a pita with your falafel balls. And then it‚Äôs simply an ‚Äúall-you-can-stuff‚Äù salad bar. They ‚Ä¶

44,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's a vegan/vegetarian place mostly for takeaway. Though they have place to seat around 8-10 people at a time. Falafel menu would have falafels in Pita bread (white or brown), fries and a drink. You can choose the drink and sauce u want ‚Ä¶"
45,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious falafel sandwich, with pickles & chilli toppings with a side of Belgian frites. Delicious & not expensive. Recommend! (Only issue with this place is there is hardly any seating area)"
46,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is the best Fallafel place I ever been. I don't know how they doing it that Fallafel is so flavour some but it's amazing! You can also add as much toppings as you want! For ‚Ç¨4.95 it's definitely value for money!
47,Maoz, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Really good food and enjoyed the unlimited salad bar that came with the falafel. Although, I kept getting a stare from one of the employees for going back continuously to fill up my pita with the salad. Seems like ""unlimited"" may not really be unlimited."

49,Maoz, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best fastfood joint for vegans. You can't beat this if you're talking about vegan fastfood. They got hummus, falafel, and a salad bar for you to custom-make your own wrap."
50,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you are in Amsterdam, your visit is not complete if you don't have falafel at Maoz. One of the best options for vegetarians. Salad bar is always fresh. Yum yum."
51,Maoz, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Accessible veggie food in Amsterdam! For a 10‚Ç¨ deal ""medium size"" you get some falafel with salad of your own choosing in a bread about the size of a grown man's hand. With the falafel you also get plenty of belgian fries in a cone, with ‚Ä¶"
52,Maoz, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Ordered a small falafel pita, was given and charged for a large instead and told ""it's no big deal"". He hadn't made the change yet or anything, he just totally ignored what I asked for. True, i's not a big deal, but I ordered a small. They ‚Ä¶"

59,Maoz, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, really good taste and unlimited toppings.

But the forks provided are too small to eat properly. Hence it is not unlimited in real sense."
60,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It's small, hardly a place to sit. The falafel, salad bar and fries make all up for it though!!! It's really good and even the mayonnaise is vegan!"

62,Maoz, 1 star ,5 years ago,"This is the worst place to visit.   I just left this place and felt like I was gypped.  The customer service was awful, and the Indian man who worked the store was extremely rude.  I was inquiring about the different sauces and after ‚Ä¶"

77,Maoz, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great falafel at good price. Many good options as well. Almost no seating however, mostly a takeout location."
78,Maoz, 2 stars ,a year ago,Very dry oily falafel. An assistant who hardly spoke Dutch and English.
