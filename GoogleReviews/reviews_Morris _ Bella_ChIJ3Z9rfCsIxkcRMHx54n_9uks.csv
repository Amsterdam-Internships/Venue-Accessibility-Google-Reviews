0,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Outstanding, uitstekand. We never experienced vegan high dining before and did not know what to expect. Morris & Bella exceeded all expectations - fantastic service, delicious creative food, leave feeling healthy and full, not weighed down by meat. Very nice atmosphere in the restaurant too."
1,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Absolutely loved our dinner. Innovative dishes beautifully presented, tasteful with varied flavours.
The space is very cosy as well with good atmosphere. ‚Ä¶"
2,Morris & Bella, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Good but not great, felt like other fancy dining but vegan and without a lot of texture and strong flavours. A bit too brightly lit, not a great atmosphere."
3,Morris & Bella, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"My babe liked it. Food was creative and tasty, presented in a nice way, but a 4 course meal took 3.5 hours to be served - way too long. The waitress was friendly and explained everything in detail. The place is nice and cosy. Price-wise, was above average you'd pay in Amsterdam."
4,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wow! Fabulous food. Wonderful mix of tastes. Menu changes every two weeks. Veg & Vegan friendly but with fish and meat as well. Presentation a 10+. Staff is super friendly. Great wine selection and affordable! I will be back often.
5,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Fantastic place! Morris & Bella is different from most other vegan restaurants. There's a 4-5-6 course menu/wine arrangement which is well thought out and changes every month. The different flavors are incredible and unique! The warmth and ‚Ä¶

8,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Great vegan food, delicious wine. As a frequent carnivor, I would say that anybody would come here and enjoy their time, the service is good, so is the wine and specially the food. Amazing"
9,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best vegan cuisine in Amsterdam. We had a plated 5 course meal with wine and everything was outstanding. Not just dinner but an event! A wonderful way to spend the evening enjoying fine crafted, well thought out, beautiful and did I mention ‚Ä¶"

12,Morris & Bella, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Enjoyed a very pleasant dinner at Morris & Bella. It's a small place with only one person providing table service. The menu is vegetarian focused, but with additional fish and meat additions for those who crave that (like me...). The choice ‚Ä¶"
13,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fine dining in casual atmosphere. Food is superb. Vegan if you want, but add fish and meat if you prefer. But either way it is delicious (and beautiful).

18,Morris & Bella, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nicely located in a relatively quiet are of Amsterdam, near the Art Deco (Amsterdamse School) rich architectural district. A modest but well-picked selection of 'biologic' beers and wines. Mostly vegan food options. Helpful staff."
19,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely restaurant with very friendly owners. The atmosphere was cozy - the food delicious. The vegan cheese plate was something special!
20,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Everything here is just perfect: the food (all vegan, with meat & fish options), the drinks, the setting (small and cozy) and finally the service. The latter almost makes you forget you're in Amsterdam, and just goes to show that some restaurants still do care about their guests."
21,Morris & Bella, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderfully creative food, great wines and a lovely atmosphere. One of the very best places to eat inventive vegan/vegetarian food in Europe!"
