10,The Happy Bull, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Usually their burgers are good. I decided to go for a crispy chicken burger and it turned out to be dry and underseasoned.
11,The Happy Bull, 5 stars ,a year ago,Excellent food and service!! The classic burger and cheeseburger were very good and worth every penny. Pair that with a milkshake and fries... pure heaven.

50,The Happy Bull, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"I‚Äôve eaten these burgers many times and loved them BUT recently realized that they changed the burger buns ‚Äî WHY?
