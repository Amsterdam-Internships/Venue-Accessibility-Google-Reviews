0,De Bajes, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great for after work drinks. A wide variety of drinks available. I had one of their local Dutch Gins which was pricey but nice. Ordered their platter of small plates, but the service was inconsistent, which they said was due a large group ‚Ä¶"
1,De Bajes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I had a lovely dinner experience in this newly opened chic street Art Bar & Restaurant! Highly recommendedüòö
2,De Bajes, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Great atmosphere and cocktails - although a little pricy. Food lost it a star as ordered Mozzarella dippers (6 sticks) and only 5 arrived.
3,De Bajes, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I love this place! Great vibe, good cocktails, amazing food and lots of top notch street art. A must visit in Amsterdam for breakfast, lunch, diner and  a great party!"
4,De Bajes, 4 stars ,4 years ago,We were at the bar with a larger group and I was really surprised with the fast service. There was almost no line for the drinks. Food was good and very tasty.
5,De Bajes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Street art interior is very well designed. On friday night when we were there dj played very pleasant disco house.
6,De Bajes, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I had dinner here once and have been here a few times during work events. The dinner was really, really good. Food is of great quality, well cooked, and abundant. When I come for work events, the nibbles are always good quality, although it ‚Ä¶"
7,De Bajes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great Food an drinks, awesome service, loved the design!"
8,De Bajes, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really cool venue. Love the art everywhere. Good cocktails and beer/wine list. Not a great place for large groups, fairly limited menu at that point. But the food was very good. The Iberico ham dish is outstanding"
9,De Bajes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice spacious bar with plenty of seating. Wide choose of drinks and snacks. They have table service until 9 or 10 pm. Its a nice place to sit and chat with friends or celebrate a birthday or other special event.
10,De Bajes, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"More of a bar than a restaurant. The acoustics of the building, combined with the firm music make it very hard to understand your dinner companions. ‚Ä¶"
11,De Bajes, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A trendy and comfortable place to go for only drinks or to grab a bite to eat. There's an industrial, artsy feel to the place and it's in an excellent location. I've been to Rembrandtplein quite often but never knew of this hidden gem. Looking forward to my next visit."
12,De Bajes, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Booked an ‚Ç¨83 per person meal and show. Shoved in the corner and couldn't see the acts. Didn't offer choice of food and was served fish which I can't eat. No alternatives given. Food was cold when served. Spent an additional ‚Ç¨150 on drinks.... Slow service. Nice decor though
13,De Bajes, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I had dinner here with colleagues and also sometimes drinks. I don't find all the food so nice and the drinks are very limited. There is only heineken, 1 IPA and some other beer (in total of 4 maybe). I tried both beef and salmon here, both are disappointing. The ambiance of the place does seem nice, but that's all it is."
14,De Bajes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Love the venue, food, and service!"
15,De Bajes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really good bar. Outstanding music and super friendly staff. Keep it up!!!
16,De Bajes, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really nice place with a great vibe in the centre of Amsterdam. Amazing food as well! It's really big and spacious and all the art gives it a cool and unique look. Good for a weekend hang out, party or dinner with friends."
17,De Bajes, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Fun place to organise events or casual meet ups with friends. Pretty good music most of the time with live acts thrown in mix. Fairly priced drinks and the food is about the average price of most other caf√©s/bars.
18,De Bajes, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice central location with some great food an drinks. Cool guys working there -  awesome service. Lovely ambient with a dj every night, ohh yeah, i loved the design! We had an #InterNations party there. Good place to hold larger events."
19,De Bajes, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to have food enjoy some drinks and later at night enjoy the DJ's skills. Conveniently located at the Rembrandtplein, without it being too touristy during the evenings. ‚Ä¶"

27,De Bajes, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good spot but of course, it's not real street art, it's a little ""too clean"" for graffiti. Hello gentrification... Nevertheless, the bar is really cool and comfortable, and it's not really expensive."
