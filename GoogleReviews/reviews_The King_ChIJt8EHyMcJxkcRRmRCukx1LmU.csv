0,The King, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good food, tasty, sweet potato fries were bang on. Slight greasy, price was more than I thought it should be, but I like to try and be open to new. I'd say 3.7 on the whole so just sneaks up to 4 star!"
1,The King, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I picked up takeaway breakfast here. We got the natural pancake, bacon pancake, and a ham and cheese omelette. The food was really good, but the service was great for us. Both the gentlemen were very nice and accommodating, even bringing the pancakes to a table to allow me to add my own toppings before packing it up."
