0,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,4 months ago,This is a lovely and warm cafe. I enjoyed my afternoon time sitting in a cozy sofa with my friend. The staff was nice. she felt sorry for the abstract art on my macha latte. I liked both the art and the latte.
1,Coffee Room, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice place! They did however forget my food order, but it eventually arrived and I got compensated."
2,Coffee Room, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy place with wide choice for vegetarians and vegans. I had a vegan chocolate cake which was super tasty but a bit pricey considering the size. The cappuccino wasn't that special in my opinion. However, a nice spot to chill if you are nearby."
3,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"The best cafe in town! Friendly staff, great coffee and great view on a canal as well as city!"
4,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What a cozy cafe! I love the flowers everywhere, great location, friendly staff, beautiful plates, and delicious food. The attention to detail here is sublime. I had the green bowl, and it was wonderfully smooth and tasty. The wait on a busy Saturday only took a few minutes :)"
5,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great place for brunch! The hummus sandwich is delicious, the bread is absolutely amazing! Nice coffee and prices are good! ‚Ç¨12.90 for a flat white and the hummus sandwich :)"
6,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The iced cappuccino was great! The coffee had just the right amount of bitterness and I loved the frothy layer on top of it. The interior feels homey/ comfortable & the service was very friendly. It's a nice place to work from your laptop.
7,Coffee Room, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"very good coffee and very friendly staff! the only issue is that it the working area upstairs gets quite busy, and if you also want to work you have to sit in the area next to the bar which is very loud."
8,Coffee Room, 1 star ,a year ago,"I was going to start by saying -with all my respect- but I found it unnecessary because of the disrespect I felt from your products, how would anyone feel after paying 4.95 euro for a piece of cheesecake that's half the size of a finger and ‚Ä¶"
9,Coffee Room, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"friendly, cozy, nice, however, the service is really not what it should be. you wait for hours, you see many customers waiting all the time while the services is behind the bar ignoring customers and giggeling around."
10,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice coffee place in Amsterdam. They also have very delicious cakes on menu and also specials! You can also sit on the terrace or inside and they also have a menu for a small bite/lunch.
11,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great atmosphere. We sat out on the terrace and it was a perfect day. The gazpacho was phenomenal. Get the gazpacho. Drop what you are doing right now and go order the gazpacho. You're welcome.

14,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I loved working with my laptop from here. A few tables have a ‚Äúno laptop‚Äù sign, be careful. They have power sockets but you need to look for then. Wi-fi sometimes goes slow. Young professional / student ambience"
15,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great spot for breakfast or lunch. They got lots of healthy options like Aca√Ø bowls, yoghurt with muesli, fresh juices and sandwiches. On sunny days the terrace is packed with people-watching locals. Of course there‚Äôs coffee here too. But if you‚Äôre a coffee lover, I‚Äôd recommend crossing the bridge and get one at Lot Sixty One."
16,Coffee Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Place is decently cozy with many working space that allowed laptops even on weekend. ‚Ä¶
17,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great coffee! I loved their cappuccino, their carrot cake and the ambience in the place. Finally a place where ‚Äúvintage decor‚Äù does not translate to ‚Äúdirty place, deal with it, it‚Äôs our style‚Äù. 5/5 would recommend!"

23,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Went here with friends not expecting much and fell in love with their chai latte! Not pricey and great quality. Its probably the best I have ever had. Great sitting area and wonderful staff.
24,Coffee Room, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Very popular working and meeting place that resemble the populace of Oud-West: 30ish young professionals, wearing sneakers and working in tech, marketing and whatever. Great decor and airy space. ‚Ä¶"
25,Coffee Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Just a coffee place like many others, but in the afternoon you can really enjoy the sun (if it's there....). Bit noisy though with the trams and cars passing by"

34,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Awesome sandwiches and coffee. Here are 2 of my lunches!
35,Coffee Room, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great coffee and the green smoothie bowl is my favorite here. On warmer sunny days the terrace is a must, but inside the cafe, it is also very nice and cozy. The service is somewhat slow, so I would not suggest going if you are in a hurry. Otherwise, this is a great place to spend time and meet with friends!"
36,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Super friendly staff and great menu!
37,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Although this place is called the Coffee Room it's more like a nice lunch place. Their sandwiches are simple but really tasty. They make different juices as well and the sweet treats are really good. Staff is really friendly and when the ‚Ä¶

42,Coffee Room, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great coffe, good sandwiches, good cakes.
The place can be a bit noisy and it's not disabled accessible since in the entrance there's a nasty 3 steps and to go to second floor the stairs are big. Due to the lack of accessibility this place is 4 starts for me"
43,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Wonderful sandwich, salad, soup choices, including gluten free and vegan, nice coffee. Three levels, each with unique own ambeance, all very cosy, informal and welcoming. Wifi, laptops friendly."

46,Coffee Room, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Really super friendly staff and the location can't be beat. Food is delicious too, if a little expensive. But it's so busy on a Sunday the service is a shambles and the coffee is cold by the time it gets to you."
47,Coffee Room, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good coffee, very nice pastries and sandwiches. The service though has significantly worsened in the past year or at least this is what I experienced last time. Will not go into details but the waitress was not customer friendly at all. My ‚Ä¶"
48,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great coffee, nice atmosphere (relaxed, lots of students lounging with laptops, easygoing music) and good service. I would recommend coming here if you‚Äôre looking for a nice long coffee with a friend. Not much food though, more of a coffee-and-pastries kind of place."

52,Coffee Room, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place and convenient with good views of the canal on the corner. However the coffee was only OK although the service was good. It‚Äôs a 3.5 stars but the coffee didn‚Äôt do enough to warrant 4 stars.
53,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best places to get coffee in the city. Adorable coffee shop with tons of comfortable seating, great vibes, and amazing coffee. Highly suggest for a hanging out with friends, reading a book solo, or grabbing brunch."
54,Coffee Room, 1 star ,2 years ago,I used to come there to work and spend the day at the cafe. However the service is now extremely bad. Forgetful and rude students. Especially one guy who was having a lot of attitude towards any customer and did not make us at ease. The ‚Ä¶
55,Coffee Room, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"The food was ok, but i waited 30min for the toast, and the service was bad."
56,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best spots in town. Variety of food and drinks, all fresh and hand made.

The place has several armchairs to seat, it's warm and has a bathroom if you need. Your laptop will be also welcome here."
59,Coffee Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Graat cozy place with comfy armchairs. Very good matcha latte and lots of non dairy milk choices. One star less cause their coffee is a bit bland and they tend to have the music a bit too loud for a chill place.
60,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great vibe! There's plenty of space for reading or catching up on some light work.
I went for coffee only but the menu had some delicious options that cater to vegans."
61,Coffee Room, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place for grabbing a coffee or just trying their Matcha Latte, very cosy atmosphere, I especially enjoy the second floor where its a library like atmosphere with plenty of contacts for your laptop. You need to order the drinks from the bar and they will bring it to you. Try the brownie.."
62,Coffee Room, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst service I have experienced. 20 mins and my coffee has not arrived. At ‚Ç¨4 euro a cup I would expect better service.
Avoid at all cost, there are much better cafes around."

69,Coffee Room, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Chai latte unfortunately didn't taste spicy at all, more like milk with honey and the cheese tosti was quite dry (it could have used more cheese). Nevertheless it remains to be a cosy cafe with a nice atmosphere."
70,Coffee Room, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good atmosphere, nice coffee, gorgeous cakes. Recommend for a quick stop or to work with your own laptop. Can be busy at times so it might be hard to find a spot."

72,Coffee Room, 1 star ,a year ago,"Sorry to say this from a usual client but the portion/size/price are not balanced at all concerning the cakes, and the coffee cup looked like it was bought from a vending machine, not nice when you take advantage of your popularity to decrease the service NOT NICE COFFEE ROOM"
