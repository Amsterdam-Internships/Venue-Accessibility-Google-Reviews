23,Pollux, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Just round the corner from the main tourist areas and sure, it's on a busy road but what a find. Friendly, warm, welcoming and even an indoor smoking room with comfy armchairs. Don't bother if you're expecting a traditional touristy pub but if you want to save some money and chill out I reckon it's hard to beat."
24,Pollux, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Well, the last time I visited this cafe was somewhere in 1978. Looking at the interior pictures not that much seems to have changed. Gives me good nostalgic feelings. Had a hell of time there during my merchant navy school time (Kweekschool voor de Zeevaart, RIP inmiddels). Good to see that place is still there. Loved it."
25,Pollux, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A group of 9 of us Australians stumbled upon pollux one afternoon for a late lunch. Not only was the food great but we were greeted with a smile (and shots) and were even supplied jumpers (belonging to the owners husband) as a number of us ‚Ä¶
