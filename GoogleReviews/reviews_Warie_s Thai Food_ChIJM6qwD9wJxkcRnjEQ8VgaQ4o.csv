13,Warie's Thai Food, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I was going down this street to the Fjallraven store which is next door.

18,Warie's Thai Food, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Small establishment - maybe 4-5 tables. Excellent food. The food is a little spicy, even my daughters sweet and sour chicken had a little kick to it. The owner cooks the food herself. She and her husband were both extremely friendly. I will definitely go there again."

20,Warie's Thai Food, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very tasty. I typically go there for take away food and it has always been delicious. I like their pad Thai and curries.

30,Warie's Thai Food, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Our go-to Thai. Had a Tom yum gai and Tofu Pad thai. Both excellent.
31,Warie's Thai Food, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Best authentic thai food. Fresh ingredients used and food made in front of u. Friendly staff and quick service. Very small place, but good and hot food. Very pricy compare to Uk thai places, but its normal Amsterdam Central price. Best thing is they serve halal meat."
32,Warie's Thai Food, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I ordered Tom Yum soup(Tom Ka Khai) with coconut thinking it'd have spicy tomato broth with coconut but instead it was just sweet coconut soup. They should write on their menu that it's a sweet coconut soup. Not what i wanted and they wouldnt event change it if you ask.
33,Warie's Thai Food, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Not a restaurant to go to for a romantic or business meeting, though whenever you are craving a fresh and healthy meal, something mild and flavorfull or very spicy, one of the crisp salads or the best Thom Kah Kai ever - yes. This is definitely the place to go to, to sooth those desires!"
34,Warie's Thai Food, 3 stars ,7 years ago,went here based on the great reviews. everything is made fresh and they were super nice but sadly the food wasn't that great. the pad Thai was pretty bland and the red curry wasn't great either.
35,Warie's Thai Food, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Ordered on the 14th, Tom kha kai, was toooo sweet.... Red curry was not hot at all and maybe even a bit too bland veggies very soggy... Sadly disappointing."
36,Warie's Thai Food, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Tight place (cozy). Food is excellent. You can see it being made right behind your table. Service is good and quick. Value is on point. Highly recommend!

51,Warie's Thai Food, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Ordered on Uber eats food was really disappointing, the fish in the soup was fried with batter. This in combination with soup makes it‚Äôs like wet bread."
52,Warie's Thai Food, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Tom Yung soup was very good, but pad Thai chicken very ordinary and bland for Western taste"
