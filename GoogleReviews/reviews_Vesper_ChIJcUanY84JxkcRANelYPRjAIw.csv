The menu changes every month, and the cocktails are really good and different. I really recommend it!"
3,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely place, they serve amazing cocktails. The manager is a great guy who told me more about his passion: cocktails. It’s amazing that they have a new menu every month. Love the Bond theme as that was the reason for me to go visit the first time."
4,Vesper, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely cocktail bar. Small but cute and the drinks were great. Service was a little slow as you'd expect in a cocktail bar, but definitely a great shout for a post dinner drink."
5,Vesper, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A new style cocktail bar, with new type of experimental, fusion cocktail varieties. Friendly people and popular with the locals. The owners have done a nice job decorating the place, although a bit small for big crowd"
6,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing little gem of a bar. We went two nights in a row. Let the bartender Ricardo make whatever you’re craving. He made something we called ‘white Christmas’ which had coffee, coconut, cream, rum, cinnamon and other amazing things. Can’t go wrong!"
7,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"When you are looking for a small, intimate bar with world-class service an cocktails for a fair price. Vesper is the place to go. The whole team has an outstanding eye for detail and flavour. Their regularly changing menu gives you a …"
8,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I heard about Vesper on a list of top rated bars in Amsterdam so I made it a destination on my first night in the city, which was also my birthday. It was an absolute joy to navigate the city for the first time late at night trying to find …"

11,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best cocktail bar in Amsterdam. Just ask Julian to fix you a cocktail. He knows his stuff,"
12,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best mixology bar in Amsterdam. Is in the heart of Jordaan and pretty close to central station. The place is very small but cozy. The stuff is friendly and they really know how to make great cocktails. Normally crowded during …
13,Vesper, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"All cocktails are amazing.  reinterpretations of classic cocktails, pleasant and welcoming service.  we'll be back soon!"
14,Vesper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very interesting and tiny place. We went at a perfect time, as there were only a few other parties there. They were in a rum-themed run when we partook, so she got this Mai Thai-esque drink and loved it."
15,Vesper, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Top best premium drinks in Amsterdam, maybe the world, definitely a hidden gem. The drink Sesam Thing is master pice! The service is friendly and passionate."
16,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Must visit!!!
Where to begin? The delightful, friendly passionate bar staff/owners, the ah-mazing moreish cocktails or the perfect, tip-of-the-hat vibes to 007 himself?
I don't know when I'll be back in Amsterdam, but returning to Vesper's is top of the list ♡"

22,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Try Bam Boo cocktail - I got it spicy and it was also great! The stuff is super helpful ❤ We ll def visit again!
23,Vesper, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Wonderful coctails !!! You need to try !!!
24,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great bar!  Wonderful cocktails that change often.  Very small place so you may have to wait but it's totally worth it. They do also participate in Amsterdam Cocktail Week.  Would highly recommend checking it out if craft cocktails are something you enjoy.
25,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The cocktails here are for me the best of the best. The guys who run this place so super friendly. One of my favorite weekend hang outs. I can not recommend any cocktail because the menu constantly changes, plus you just have to try them all. Happy discovering!"
26,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Hidden gem in my favorite city with superb cocktails
27,Vesper, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice environment and extremely helpful staff, but overall not pleasant experience. Only a small monthly selection of cocktails was available. Have asked for 2 different cocktails giving specific instructions but both were a disappointment despite being very pricey."
28,Vesper, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Had some amazing greek food and quality drinks yesterday at Vesper bar during the WOGO cocktail walk. Loved the bar, really  friendly staff. Would recommend!"
29,Vesper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cute and quirky cocktail bar. The bartenders were super nice and helpful in picking out a drink. Prices were a bit high, but average for what you'd expect for a nice cocktail."
30,Vesper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great bar with super staff who couldn’t be more helpful. Wonderful cocktails!
31,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Highly recommend this place. If you love cocktails the bar staff will talk you through anything you're not sure about and they are made very well. Small place but fantastic atmosphere. Drinks aren't cheap so be prepared for your bill
32,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing cocktails and super gezellig bar. Particularly enjoy being able to tell the bartenders the type of flavours and liquor you like and leaving them to invent something on your behalf. Draws a good crowd and deserving of being so busy as it’s awesome
33,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A fantastic cocktail bar, lead by young and creative barmen. It's not cheap but it's absolutely worth being visited. Very young and noisy, though charming, mood. The name stems from the famous ""Vesper Martini cocktail"", quoted in the first James Bond's novel, ""Casino Royale""."
34,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Small bar with a tasty and interesting set of cocktails. Last time we went it was a Rye focused menu and had a good variety of drinks. Only a few tables which are hard to get as it is so small but a nice atmosphere
35,Vesper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"A wonderful little cocktail place with a couple of complete experts behind the bar. The drinks are definitely a tad pricey (12 - 16 euro), but well worth the money. …"
36,Vesper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Inventive cocktails with fresh ingredients.  Menu often changes with the season.
37,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing cocktail place! The staffs are very friendly, funny and attentive. They serve very creative cocktails, which might be found only in Amsterdam. Lol. We had a girls night out here and had so much fun time there. The place is quite small so it gets packed easily but you will still feel comfortable and cosy."
38,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Loved it here. This boutique cocktail bar is brilliant. It is cosy and chic, and the staff were amazing! We had so much fun with them. Drinks were out of this world. Well worth a visit."
39,Vesper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Down to earth cocktail bar. Looking for the most unique cocktails around. No high-end fancy guys, just a small place with the most amazing ingredients you've ever tasted. Menu changes once in a while with new ingredients."
40,Vesper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Vesper bar is located right in the city center in a cozy small street with charm. This bar is well known for their specialty in creating great cocktails. Although I don’t drink alcohol but there expertise in making un alcoholic cocktails impressed my sophisticated taste in un alcoholic beverages. #cocktails
41,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent cocktail place. Not cheap, but the cocktails are amazing. The Leap of Faith is always worth it (cocktails made by the guys, based on a theme or ingredients), and the guys work really hard. Definitely one of my favorite spots to hang in Amsterdam."
42,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Local and classic cocktail bar in Amsterdam. Amazing drinks on a rotating menu and super chill attitude and vibe. The Vesper is always amazing and far better drinks than the more known cocktail bars in the city.
43,Vesper, 1 star ,3 years ago,Poor service and ignorant management. I have been visiting from this bar ever since they opened but service has been going down ever since while prices and ignorance of staff only went up. Taking side of Airbnb visitors over regular local …
44,Vesper, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Crazy busy on a Friday night, but for one simple reason... They make incredible cocktails. The menu is cool too with cocktails from sour to sweet and from strong to mild."
45,Vesper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I like the rotating menu - each time I visit there's something new, something special. The place is really small, although they usually don't mind people occupying any suitable space. Drinks were really good, too. The only potty is they open from 8pm only and closed on Sun/Mon."
46,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Hipster cocktails in the hipster capital. Complaining it's pretentious seems a bit churlish - of course it's silly to shave a slice of orange peel in the general direction of the drink and then discard it, but it was a bloody lovely drink made with a lot of care and skill. Music is great too."
47,Vesper, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Don't expect a James Bond theme. There's only a few small photos on the wall which was hugely disappointing. Watching the cocktail being made by the mixologist was a show. The taste and high cost of it however was the let down. The bar has a pretentious vibe and attracts those kinds of people.
48,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Interesting cocktails with inspirations drawn from all over the world, must try at least 3. …"
49,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The cocktail bar worth checking out. The crew is so welcoming annnnd most importantly they make really really good cocktails.
50,Vesper, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We were intrigued by the James Bond reference and hence decided to pay a visit. The place has a good vibe, is a bit expensive, quite small, and you end up having some quick conversations with strangers coz you share tables. I asked the …"
51,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fun, cocktail bar with weekly menus. The attendees were entertaining and friendly. The cocktails were really good too."
52,Vesper, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect Vesper drink at Vesper. It is a small bar. The 007 James Bond theme is somewhat discreet and the few people that were present could possibly have been seated at any bar. A cosy place, though."
53,Vesper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Best cocktail bar ever, every detail is refined and perfected. I went for the Mai Tai and Ricardo blew me away with the ""Italian Mai Tai""  The best cocktail I have ever had. Place should be on your bucket list."
54,Vesper, 5 stars ,a year ago,In this bar i tasted one of the best cocktails that i ever had in my life.
55,Vesper, 5 stars ,a year ago,Is a small cocktail bar. But is well renown. If you fancy a real damm good cocktail here is the right place.
56,Vesper, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cute little bar. Funky cocktails that changes according to season. Good service. Prices:13-14€ per small cocktail.
57,Vesper, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice, cosy bar and the cocktails are amazing! Definitely a place to visit if you are looking for a good experience and interesting drinks"
58,Vesper, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I was told this is THE place to go if you're a Bond fan. Let me save you some time if you're a fan: it is not. The collection of Bond stuff is as follows:
- Two books (both Casino Royale) on a shelf behind the bar …"
59,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Small local very goed cocktail bar in the heart of the Joraan area
60,Vesper, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Great cocktails, very small place, so you might need to have some patience to get a nice place to hangout or get the service you expect. Hit and miss, if it's not too crowded, you'll love it :)"

66,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Atmosphere and drinks are spectacular! Smaller than it appears and casual dress code on weekdays loved taking my girlfriend here on our European trip
67,Vesper, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very unique cocktail bar! A must-go!
68,Vesper, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really great cocktails!! I recommend the Jacky Chan and the one with the Beetroot. Cool food as well- sugar snaps and tempeh crisps :)
69,Vesper, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Cute cocktail bar with a big wink to our 007 secret agent. It can get crowded quickly especially during the weekends which turns around the nice atmosphere of the bar.
70,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really good and hidden place to get a cocktail! They can make you anything you want! Definitely going back there!
71,Vesper, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The BEST bar experience I've had in Amsterdam. The team are SO passionate and really know down to the letter what they are talking about - highly recommend.
