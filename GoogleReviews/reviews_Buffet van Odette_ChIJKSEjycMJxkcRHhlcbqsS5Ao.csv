0,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,a month ago,The food was good but the portions were really small for the price. They also didn‚Äôt have many gluten free options. The interior was really cute though.
1,Buffet van Odette, 1 star ,8 months ago,"WAIT TO BE SEATED!
I have been waiting, waiting for 12' standing at the entrance door, restaurant and terrace were not full nor there were guests in line in front of me. Odette, ‚Ä¶"
2,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good. Wine was good. Company was good. Weather wasn't good but it's the Netherlands. Rain, rain, rain. Order the onglet steak and the 2018 gamay red wine. You will enjoy it, I promise. Get the madeleines for dessert. You will ‚Ä¶"
3,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Great setting, friendly staff and a very diverse menu. Wasn't overly impressed with their wines but at this price point they simply provide excellent value for money."
4,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious. Always busy so either give yourself some time in the queue or plan ahead and make a reservation. I had the mushrooms and polenta. It was super tasty and so rich in flavour. I'd definitely go back again. üòç
5,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Very good food and dessert. Especially dessert.
6,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is amazing! The place is a treasure in Amsterdam, their ""Vongole with Bread"" is an absolute delight to eat. The servers are friendly and you can see the cooks in action if you sit at the bar. Their house wines do not disappoint."
7,Buffet van Odette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place and good food.  They have a nice selection or natural wines.  Very popular place among locals.
8,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place is a special one. Beautil location on the corner of a small street, facing a channel. Food is gorgeous and extremely well done. You can go for a lunch or just for a wine at happy hour with friends, you will not regret. Cheers!"
9,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Small place not too busy and crowded on the canals. Great for brunch and dinner. Small menu to pick from but with gorgeous fresh products
10,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went with a small group for lunch and we all agreed the food was very tasty. Fairly small portions, and quite crowded when we went at 1PM on a Friday."
11,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Location: fantastic in the centre of Amsterdam
Service: professional
Interieur: Bistro-style, seating a bit crammed ‚Ä¶"
12,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best meals I've had in Amsterdam, we had to sit outside in relatively cold weather, because we did not make a reservation, and yet it was still worth it."
13,Buffet van Odette, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Weird menu and terribly slow service. Waited 45 minutes after ordering dinner for food. Staff friendly but does not wear face masks. I would not go back.
14,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stopped here mid-afternoon to rest weary feet and enjoy a quiet glass of wine just around the corner from the busy thoroughfare on Spiegelstraat. Although the kitchen was not yet offering the full dinner menu, the Aperitivo menu was exactly ‚Ä¶"
15,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wonderful place to have a lunch or dinner. Affordable prices and nice environment. ‚Ä¶
16,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Upper class place in posh neighborhood. Always busy with que outside better book on advance. Interesting menu. Quality ingredients.
17,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent meal, traditional food, great flavors. Mostly locals which made us happy. Highly recommended as non-touristy."
18,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Quick service. Delicious food. Friendly waitresses that spoke fantastic English.
19,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely place. Went for lunch with a friend and a stroller, team offered a spot where we could place the baby. Food- mainly small dishes to accompany wine- were well thought and executed. Interior is rather simple & elegant, loved it. Will visit again."
20,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great little restaurant just far away enough from main tourist drag.
21,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice located restaurant next to the canal.
Food is really nice and well presented. You won't find there any usual meal but more fine tuned stuffs based on NL/European foods. It is fine and delicious. ‚Ä¶"
22,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Looks super nice
But no availability without reservation‚Ä¶.
Don‚Äôt go unless you table is secure first"
23,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice restaurant away from the tourists (mostly). Interesting wine list. Menu choice is well thought through and food quality is excellent. Service is also very good. Because it is so popular you need to book.
24,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Make a reservation if you want to eat here during peak times, even weekend lunch/brunch! Small menu of tasty, modern dishes focusing on fresh produce, cheese and eggs, plus nice wines. Their salad buffet (they make it, not you) was ‚Ä¶"

27,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favorite restaurants in Amsterdam! They have a great wine selection. The service was good but they closed the kitchen twice on us without asking us for main course or desserts.
28,Buffet van Odette, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food and wine cart is great but customer service is not acceptable!
We were turned away 3 times during lunch as the waiter claimed everything was booked, however other people just went in without reservation. ‚Ä¶"
29,Buffet van Odette, 1 star ,3 years ago,Very rude staff! Especially the blond guy with glasses and greasy hair. The food was average and was not fresh. The wine selection was pretty poor as well. I would definitely avoid! There are much nicer places with much warmer welcomes! ‚Ä¶
30,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I always enjoy going there; the food never disappoints and sometimes surprises me with some unusual ingredients. Staff was nice when I last went; he recommended a nice German wine which I would have never picked myself, but it worked well."
31,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent Dutch cafe experience. I had squid as a starter and quickly scoffed the lot. Clams main course complimented the seafood theme. An Austrian white was lovely.  Draght beer good quality. Go for it guys. Worth paying that little bit extra.
32,Buffet van Odette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice brunch on a sunny Saturday. Book I g recommended,since the place gets really busy on weekends. Honestly,choice is not that extensive and prices are a bit too high for what the offer is. I had scrumbled eggs with cheese,served with some bread. Drinks are a bit expensive as well. An enjoyable meal but nothing too special or different."
33,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Such a cute little place! You'd never find it it's a bit hidden. My friend suggested it.
Had the smoked salmon and it was so good! ‚Ä¶"
34,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We kept hearing ‚Äútheir selection is small, but what they have is great,‚Äù and this proved true. Warm, welcoming atmosphere on a chilly night; excellent service. Good wine list. I‚Äôm home in the states and cant stop wishing for more of their ‚Ä¶"
35,Buffet van Odette, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We were a group of three ladies who wanted to have a quick drink before dinner. Didnt even get a seat at the bar or bank outside in the almost empty restaurant, because they were preparing for dinner. Nevertheless, other guests had a drink - how rude!"
36,Buffet van Odette, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Really nice location and if you can sit outside on a nice day this place is good for lunch. This restaurant is what every home-chef food-blogger's wet dream looks like. The food is mostly good, healthy, and seasonal, but overpriced. A ‚Ä¶"
37,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good for lunch or dinner, this nice place is not overrun by tourists and a little upscale but not to fancy. Nice ambience, though it can get hot inside and tables a pretty close together. Food is great with mostly sandwiches and salads for lunch and full dinner menu."
38,Buffet van Odette, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I wasn't too impressed by the limited menu options (the menu was not up to date). Portion sizes are somewhat small and pricy. Service is very friendly and relatively quick. But what was really disappointing, was the fact it had a note ‚Ä¶"
39,Buffet van Odette, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Slow service, average, VERY overpriced food. You can eat much better in Amsterdam."
40,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, great wine list. I had the beetroots salad and the crumble, everything was perfect. Special mention for the bread and butter, both of which are excellent!"
41,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food and friendly service - in a very Dutch sort of way. This was one of the more memorable and enjoyable lunch spots we ate at. Best of all, it felt local and not touristy."
42,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A bit expensive but really fun vibe; think of it as a neighbourhood high-end dinner. Fresh pasta made every day (the ravioli is generally a safe bet); a good steak, and excellent smoked salmon on lentils. ‚Ä¶"
43,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really cute restaurant with great desserts. You may have a wait for a table. And they have weird meals like the steak sandwich (a piece a steak on a bread) or the eggs with the marmite sauce. But overall, really good food, and my favorite ‚Ä¶"
44,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"We are returning customers, and have dined twice.  It was the height of the summer, on a arm clear Amterdam evening, walking down the canal being especially romantic.  Up popped a window with a busy super efficient chef.  I could tell just ‚Ä¶"
45,Buffet van Odette, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The evening was culinary disappointing. The appetizers were good at the beginning but at the finish unloving and without sophistication. After more than 1,5 hour wait the main course came. We've got a black mass of fried mushrooms with ‚Ä¶"
46,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I just love BvO! It's one of my favourite places to have brunch or dinner with friends or family whenever I'm in Amsterdam. The place and the food just feel so homely. There is always a very good vibe and buzz and the staff is lovely too. ‚Ä¶
47,Buffet van Odette, 3 stars ,a year ago,Very good coffee and drinks - however service was quite slow and is not really looking after you if you want to have another drink or so. It also took too long until we then finally received a coffee
48,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Incredible little gem in the heart of the canals. Friendly staff, Scrumptious food and a view like you can only find in Amsterdam. Buffet van Odette is the perfect place for a diner with friends, family reunion or romantic date. (Their sticky toffee pudding reminded me of my time in the south of England.., it is To die for)"
49,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The service here was quick and prompt, which is unusual. I had 2 starters and a side. Too much for for one person! Combination of 2 would've sufficed. However, good was delicious, and service attentive. Seating facing the canal is a big plus."
50,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very nice place, fairly small and crowdy.
Open kitchen, clean, service is okay and food is good.
Portions are not big or small, they are decent. ‚Ä¶"
51,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great little gem in Amsterdam. Perfect location with a view of the canal. Elegant and bistro like dishes. Good portions and beautiful food. Correct service and visited by locals as well as tourists. I was not disappointed!
52,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely meal outside on the canal. Excellent and friendly service, very good food. Only slight criticism was that the chair I was sitting on was rather uncomfortable period however, the overall experience was great period"
53,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful and surprising menu. Very friendly service.
54,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"nice place for a rest in Amsterdam.  sticky toffee cake .... delicious and  sticky,  while  the coffee staid below expectations."
55,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Small and very nice place to eat. The service is very agreable and the service pretty fast. The quality like many restaurants in Amsterdam is of a very good quality. The fee too...
56,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favourite places for brunch or lunch. Order the egg truffle omelet or any of the other dishes, it‚Äôs all delicious and in a very cosy setting with actual table linen."
57,Buffet van Odette, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice place. Great food. Good wine. Atrocious service - hopefully an isolated incident and we just experienced one very bad waitress.
58,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Wonderful food. Don't forget to make a reservation!
They're almost always booked in advance, although if you come before 12 you have a chance of getting a table for lunch without reservations."
59,Buffet van Odette, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"I came for brunch at 10:30. With three other people in the shop, it took 10 min to say anything at all to me, then another 20 for a coffee to reach me. I didn't stay for more. Pretty good coffee, though."
60,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice place, nice people and good meeting place for date"
61,Buffet van Odette, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I would have given 4 stars for the friendly service, food and atmosphere. Unfortunately they forgot our orders. Not just once but twice. Good thing that the drinks were on the house to make it up."
62,Buffet van Odette, 4 stars ,6 years ago,We arrive to it walking around Amsterdam and looking for a place to have good and hot coffee. We get a good place to stay and a very nice staff. I will come back to have lunch if I get back to Amsterdam to taste the food.
63,Buffet van Odette, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Unfortunately we had a very bad experience at this restaurant. The owner of the restaurant was very rude to us and to the other customers, the food was nothing special and quite expensive. This area is plenty of better restaurantes than this one."
64,Buffet van Odette, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The food is delicious, the service is excellent and the place is perfect for a romantic meal as well as for a good fun with a group of friends. The Boudin and the raviolis are just perfect !"

69,Buffet van Odette, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Our very short and very bad experience at Bufet van Odet: we came in, were ignored by the staff, I asked a tall blond waiter if she can help us when she got annoyed and her answer was: no I have something else to do. And gone she was"
