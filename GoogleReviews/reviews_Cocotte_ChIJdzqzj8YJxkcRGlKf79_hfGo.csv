0,Cocotte, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Excellent experience! You get the whole package: quality, quantity, presentation of the food, served by a friendly and caring staff, bathed in an authentic french playlist :) The real galettes bretonnes that I struggle to find elsewhere in the Netherlands. I highly recommend it"
1,Cocotte, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Perhaps one of the coziest cafés in the center of Amsterdam. Great place to hide from the crowds and take a moment. I ate a Galette Normandie and it was delicious. Lovely interior design, music and owners. Un petit coin de France en plein cœur d’Amsterdam, parfait."
2,Cocotte, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Def worth the discovery. Lovely small corner cafe that does amazing breakfast, brunch all day menus. I had the brunch with orange juice, freshly baked baguette rolls with really nice salty butter, black coffee, and a buckwheat pancake …"
3,Cocotte, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Love this cute cosy French place.

4,Cocotte, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"This place is a tiny piece of France in the middle of Amsterdam. The owner is the kindest person in the world and once you try one of his crepes, you feel immediately in a traditional french crêperie! Finally, I will suggest you to try the Suzette. One of the softest and most delicate treasures of this gem!"
5,Cocotte, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Beautiful and cozy place where to spend a little time for an excellent hot chocolate and french crêpes. Very nice and smiling staff.
6,Cocotte, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Cute french café and crêperie in the centre of Amsterdam, a bit of a french cultural heritage with great crêpes and gluten free crêpes!!! Definitely will be visiting way more in the future! C'est trés bon!"
7,Cocotte, 5 stars ,a month ago,Beautiful savoury galettes and crêpes French style. Don't expect to find Dutch small pancakes (poffertjes). Very enjoyable.
8,Cocotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I like this little French dessert place in the city. It actually fit my category of dessert that night. If you look at my photos they serve hot chocolate pretty different, hot milk and chocolate separate and condensed milk. The milk adds sweetness without overwhelming it. Try their crepes. So cozy it feels like you're in France."
9,Cocotte, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very high quality french owned crepperie. Drinks and food were outstanding(in particular the salted caramel creppe and the chai latte).

11,Cocotte, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Greate taste and very friendly staff. Unfortunately the portions are very small (and quite pricey for the size). Don't expect the breakfast to feed you till lunch. But, if you are only looking for a good coffee and a small bite I'd still recommend it."

16,Cocotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A little gem in the heart of Amsterdam with delicious galettes and a cozy atmosphere. If it’s full—roughly 20 people—it gets a bit crowded but the food and atmosphere make up for it. …
17,Cocotte, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Maybe one of the best cafe in whole netherlands. The place is amazing. Just a few tables for the lucky ones but then you will be enjoying your crepe inside an old storage place dated back to the 18th century. Coffee and beverages are …
18,Cocotte, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This lovely french cafe really focusses on ""vraiement"" French food. It's homemade, it's good, perfect taste and good service. Bit small tables but that's also a charm. The shop itself is rather nice aswell."
19,Cocotte, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Great place for having a breakfast with friendly staff. We ordered a crepe and jam with butter. The crepe was amazing and tasty. The only minor issue was that the bread was not that fresh and you could see it from the taste.
20,Cocotte, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a fantastic breakfast at Cocotte. I ordered the Province, which is a tasty and cheesy Italian mix of flavors. It lactated a bit when I tried to cut it (order it and you'll know what I mean) but it was perfectly cooked and absolutely …"

57,Cocotte, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place. Small but cozy, good crepes and friendly staff. The trip to the bathroom can be an adventure due to the size of the stairs. The coffee here is OKish but not on par with the deserts.Very few tables inside so you have to be really lucky if you are visiting during the cold months when the tables outside are not usable."
