0,Hummus House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"If you like HUMMUS, this is the place. Friendly accommodating staff and fresh vegetarian food. Not the cheapest, but very tasty. It is usually busy and seating is limited, so don't come in large groups. They do takeaway too."
1,Hummus House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Definitely the best food so far in Amsterdam!
The hummus was creamy and tasty, simply amazing.
The potato were good too. Highly recommend!!"
2,Hummus House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,If you want to eat a yummy bowl full of delicious homemade hummus and pitta bread this is the place for you! There's a good choice of options on the menu.
3,Hummus House, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a very good quick dinner at this place. The hummus is very good and affordable. The only down side is that they don't serve any alcohol. After a spicy hummus, a beer would be a very good fit."
4,Hummus House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very helpful staff, delicious pitas, hummus and extras, portions don't look big, but actually hard to finish for one person. Loved the music on the background. They do run out of everything before the closing time though."
5,Hummus House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect hummus and pitas! I took aubergine, guacamole and egg as topping. Perfect sauces. 15 eur"
6,Hummus House, 3 stars ,3 years ago,It looks authentic but the taste is honestly not impressive.. And I don’t get how they need like 20 minutes to prepare the food.. worst part is that the homemade lemonade is served in a glass that it is clearly not washed properly (the outside of the glass had something sticks)
7,Hummus House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This place is a real treat. The pita is so fresh and delish, plus everything on the menu is tasty.
Relatively cheep prices, a very good option for vegetarians and vegans."
8,Hummus House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,It's a very nice and cozy spot to grab a bite! Staff was friendly and relaxed. I definitely recommend the tapas side dishes to go along with the hummus plate. It was delicious!

17,Hummus House, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"We came on a Saturday at 6pm, but they ran out of food. We didn't mind waiting for them to prepare more food, but they didn't even had time to serve any drinks or anything else. We waited for 40 minutes until more food could be served and …"
18,Hummus House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was AMAZING! Love this place. We were a party of 10 and yet they served us pretty quickly. The hostess was very friendly and helpful. The variety of options was great and everything we ordered was made well. Loved my time there. Highly recommended.

20,Hummus House, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Hummus looks fancy, its good, but not extraordinary. Staff was very rude though.

21,Hummus House, 1 star ,4 years ago,"My husband and I just had the worst experience at this restaurant. When my husband questioned the extremely long time we had to wait for the food to be served, one of the staff members tried to pick a fight with him. Bold enough to push …"
22,Hummus House, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best hummus in the city (afaik). Just as good as in Israel according to a coworker.

24,Hummus House, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is freshly made, staff knows what is in it and can advice you on the vegan options. The Hummus is excellent as is the service and all food I tasted. I highly recommend to spend some time here. Enjoy!"

28,Hummus House, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Had no idea we were about to stumble into one of the most amazing food experiences ever! The food was that good, that I wished everyone walking past the store would come and join in too and experience this incredible cuisine . Fresh, healthy and absolutely delicious! Would highly recommend you give this a try."
29,Hummus House, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Unfortunately, this place lacked the knack for waitering etiquette and class. My friends and I ventured into this restaurant without a reservation, and a group similar to our numbers without a reservation arrived after us and were promptly …"
30,Hummus House, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This is by far the best hummus I have ever tasted. My ex-wife makes pretty good hummus, and I have tasted Okay hummus both in New York and France. But this is on another level, much like you THINK you have tasted pizza until you try the …"

To be honest, the food was good. …"
32,Hummus House, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Far from having the 'Best hummus in town', the food was nothing more than mediocre - store-bought varieties of hummus have tasted better. Don't bother with the Homemade Lemon - it was vile and overpriced. The service, more to the point, was …"
33,Hummus House, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The food was good and the staff friendly, but the portion sizes and the variety on the menu could be larger. An ingredient delivery (cans of vegetables) took place during lunchtime, leaving the door open and the place cold. One restroom was out of order and the other one could not be locked from inside."

Seating is a little bit cramped.
I recommend ordering one portion of hummus and one other dish for two people."
