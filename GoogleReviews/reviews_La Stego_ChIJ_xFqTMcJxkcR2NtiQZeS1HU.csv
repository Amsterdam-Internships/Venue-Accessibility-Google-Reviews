0,La Stego, 1 star ,a month ago,Dont go. This place is horrible.  Vegetables and salad are frozen food. Meat is cheap quality. Mushroom sauce is powder with water.  Like seriously guys revieuw your dishes this is only profit making and screw tourists screw the people right? What a shame even your mothers wont eat there
1,La Stego, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food was delicious, we order ribs and lamb chops which came with a side salad and rice. The rice was amazing and the source that came with it. However i think we over paid for the plate of food even thou we enjoyed it. I will recommend if you gave extra money to spend if not there are other alternatives around the the street."
2,La Stego, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"(12/3)
We chose two special dishes -- steak & ribs, which tasted quite good. The store has a comfortable environment and the music on the day is also very good."
3,La Stego, 1 star ,2 years ago,"the worst place in my life. They don't speak english well enough. They are always busy to help you, no patience. They charge the sauce of the beef.
They don't explain how it works the prices. The special menu with better prices …"
4,La Stego, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Environment is not perfect, staff talks english, polish, french, dutch and although it is place for tourists food is perfect. We order steak ( medium ) and ribs they was delicious. Do not forget to order draft beer for dessert :)"
5,La Stego, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing service and amazing food! The cheeseburger is to Die for and the people who work here are super nice, overall 5/5 service"
6,La Stego, 2 stars ,6 months ago,"Tastes more like fast food. The steaks are ok but fries are not fresh, not home made. It's difficult to find a real Argentinian restaurant in Amsterdam. They're not Argentinians."
7,La Stego, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Surprised at some of the reviews mentioning terrible food. I thought the fillet steak was delicious. Presentation could have done with a little work- it was basically just the steak and chips on a plate, but I don't care when it tastes that …"
8,La Stego, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place to have a nice Argentinian steak for a comparatively lower price in the heart of Amsterdam. Staff speaks good English (and Spanish) and very friendly. The food is average, but still good for the price. The place is not much …"
9,La Stego, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Mid-scale restaurant with simple menu. Steak was prepared properly for medium rare and separate side dishes were good, if simple—French fries and a green salad. House red wine was OK, although there is a reasonable selection on their wine …"
10,La Stego, 1 star ,4 years ago,"+ Price was fine, having the central location in mind.

11,La Stego, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I never write reviews but this was so bad I had to.

12,La Stego, 1 star ,3 years ago,Tourist trap. We had to pay 10 EUR for the bread that we did not order. Waiter replied that he had asked for bread which was not true. Better watch out and stay away. The smell was also horrible. We could smell some chlorine used for cleaning the toilet in the whole restaurant.
13,La Stego, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst experience at a restaurant I've had. Food is overpriced and everything comes at a cost, like a choice of sauce to go with my steak was an extra, and the chips to go with it too... What kind of a meal is a steak with no garnish and no …"
14,La Stego, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We went to this restaurant twice in a four day trip to Amsterdam in February.  Fillet steaks to die for, highly recommend their onion rings.  Family run business who are battling the big chains.  Waiters were lovely and fun."
15,La Stego, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice food, very nice price"
16,La Stego, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Bad food, only bones.
Make you a favor, do not go.
Totally unsatisfied."
17,La Stego, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Good food...that's all the good thing about this place. On the other side, bored and non- patient waiter,sick'n tired attitude all the time,made us feel totally unwelcomed,the prices on the menu inside are different than the ones written outside."
18,La Stego, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"We stopped here for dinner, I ordered steak, it was cooked perfectly, the restaurant had a good atmosphere, the toilets are on the second floor up some steep steps. Overall a good experience."
19,La Stego, 4 stars ,11 years ago,"Food was quite good. According to my father in law you have to go to a very expensive restaurant in the States to get a steak that good. Atmosphere is ok. It is rather amateuristic though: mayonaise in sachets, for example."
20,La Stego, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Mediocre food, terrible prices. They also charged for sauces and salt and pepper, which would have been fine had I known."
21,La Stego, 5 stars ,14 years ago,I chanced this little restaurant and was really surprised... I had the Bife de Lomo 300Gr and it was really up in the top 5 steaks I have ever had... and I have been all through Sth America... I would definitely recommend trying this great little restaurant out. More than meets the eye
