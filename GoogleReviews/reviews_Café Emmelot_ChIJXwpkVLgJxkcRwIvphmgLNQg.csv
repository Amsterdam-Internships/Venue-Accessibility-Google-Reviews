0,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 months ago,We were refused for a drink. Company is actively working with QR codes and thus medical discrimination. There is even a big sign outside to get your QR and ID ready. They better rename to 1984 or Orwell cafe.
1,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,a month ago,"Would be nice if the waiter mentions that you can only pay in cash before ordering... Beer was definitely heavily watered up.
There are much nicer places in the city"
2,Caf√© Emmelot, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Busy place, but nice seating close to the graacht!"
3,Caf√© Emmelot, 3 stars ,6 months ago,Busy bar along the walking path in Amsterdam. Friendly staff and decent drinks. But they'll kick you out and turn the lights off immediately at midnight.

Cash only payments is super medieval, only one toilet (without the seat). And ‚Ä¶"
5,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The worst place with the worst service. The waitresses were the rudest I have ever seen. I wanted to order tea, which they didn't have, and one of my friends didn't want anything, but she was told that if she wants to sit inside, she has to ‚Ä¶"
6,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Nice place for a drink, next a channel, and Raquel from the staff was super lovely and speak great Spanish!"
7,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Nice place next to tue canal with outside seating and many different beer offerings
8,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,5 months ago,Very rude place. We came with our guest and they were asked to get up from the table 10 minutes after we had our drink.  I've been living in Amsterdam for years this is the first time I've seen such a thing. Touristy cafe.
9,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great to sit by the canal and sip on a beer, pints of Amstel were 6 euros."
10,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,5 months ago,Rude waitress. Never actually got my drink and then asked us to move if we were not getting more drinks
11,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Rude waitress. Only accepted cash.

They didn‚Äôt let one friend sit on the terrace because she didn‚Äôt order a drink.

Never again."

13,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favourite places to just sit and chill when I'm in town
14,Caf√© Emmelot, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Unfortunately, I come here to clear my mind and have a little fun, but it's forbidden to smoke on the terrace, it makes me sad"
15,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Beer was fine, ‚Ç¨3 per 250ml but no matter how long you spent in the bar drinking, the toilet always costs 50 cents. Today myself and my friends spent ‚Ç¨30 on drinks but still had to pay 50 cents each to use the (not very pleasant - no soap) ‚Ä¶"
16,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,Sat down for one red Port with my wife. After waiting for 5 minutes got told everyone behind the table has to order something. What??? Rather go another place...
17,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Extremely disgusted with the service!! The attitude of the waitress behind the bar was unlike any I've experienced before - outright rude and abrupt. '4 people, 4 drinks - nothing is free in this place', she shouted, after simply asking for a beer and 3 waters. Highly recommend avoiding this place at all times."
18,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love idea of blankets and pillows outside bar   chairs .Plus heating above didn't wanted leave this place .

21,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice bar, good location on the canal, clean, cozy and a happy crew giving great service."
22,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,Poor and overpriced beer selection. Indifferent staff. They charge paying customers 50 cents to use the bathroom. And a guy next at the table next to me stood up and pissed his pants. If these are the kind of people you want to be around have fun!
23,Caf√© Emmelot, 4 stars ,5 months ago,A building lit up
24,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terrible. Rubbish service. Outrageously rude. Absolutely no interest in returning. Treat tourists like garbage, hundreds of better cafes worth spending your money in where you won't be treated like scum."
25,Caf√© Emmelot, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It‚Äôs alright caf√© for a quick beer, snacks and people watching near the red light zone. Friendly staff and chilled mood. There‚Äôs a fair selection of beers. But the best is the view. There‚Äôs always something interesting happening around."
26,Caf√© Emmelot, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Not the best service! It‚Äòs very expensive. Service-lady declined our order, because her note-pad was full ü§£ But after 15 min she brought our drinks."
27,Caf√© Emmelot, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Draft beer, a terrace to watch the tourist wandering around. Friendly staff, good food of great variety. Perfect place to spend an hour or teo if you are not in a hurry. Sit down, slow down, make friends, it's easy here!"
28,Caf√© Emmelot, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Very quick service, nice people but they accept only cash, not pin, really?"

31,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,"If I could rate it zero stars, I would. Rude bar lady who kicked me and my partner out as we weren‚Äôt having anything to drink, although our 6 friends were paying customers. Go figure. Great business right there."
32,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,Only 1 star because they charge for using the toilet for customers 50 cents only on a Saturday so avoid that night but definitely quieter than last night so they deserve less customers. Last night was good that‚Äôs why we came back üôÑ
33,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Overpriced drinks, rude staff. Zero customer service by the two women working bebind the bar, actually zero is understated. Downright rude and obnoxious is more fitting. Do yourself a favour and do not attend this bar."
34,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very disapointing!! Shocking treatment of customers. My friends were yelled at for ordering water, copped too much attitude and were made to feel very uncomfortable. Who trains these staff members?! The conversations of other unhappy ‚Ä¶"
35,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Decided to try and enjoy a few drinks at this bar! We were greeted by a man who was rude, glasses and dark hair! Our beer was 12 euro and was disgusting watered down and flat! The guy would not swop our dink‚Äôs or refund us and he said ‚ÄòI ‚Ä¶"
36,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,4 years ago,"You go there with friends, don't feel like drinking and you cannot stay if you're not consuming just because you are ""taking a seat"". Not to mention that every person in the group must consume to get access to the WiFi. The place is nice, it really is, but this kind of idiotic management creates an awful experience."
37,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,I‚Äôve never seen such a terrible service in Amsterdam anywhere. Anywhere! And I never thought that after paying for some overpriced but terrible cocktails me and my friends would be verbally attacked and yelled at by the violent waitress who ‚Ä¶
38,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Never go here. Asked for 2 drinks. Waitress said ‚Ç¨32 euro. I said no, for 2 doubles. She said double the drink, double the price. Plus cash only. No card payments. Got totally scammed"
39,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice place in a great location.  Recommended!
40,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,5 years ago,Grumpy bar lady unwelcoming. When ordering a tea the the bar lady shouted ''milk?!'' at me and snarled at me as though I had called her a terrible name. Charged me silly amount. Rubbish loud music. There was a pool table. It is red in ‚Ä¶
41,Caf√© Emmelot, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Pretty decent place to get a beer by the canal. Staff serve outdoors and are fairly on the ball. Prices are average for the area, main beer seems to be Amstel. Nice enough little place."

43,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Loved this little cafe pub and sitting under the heat lamps outside overlooking a canal and watching the world go by. 6 euros for a litre Amstel. 8 euros for a mini bottle of prosecco.

45,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very nice!

48,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Clean, reasonably priced and very ambient atmosphere"
49,Caf√© Emmelot, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Pricey, small selection of draught beers. Service not great, but the worst thing is ""we charge 50 cents for the bathroom on Saturday to anyone and yes we know it's illegal""."
50,Caf√© Emmelot, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very cool bar
51,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible service! I didn't know any of the beers inside and the bartender just rushed to pick one without any patience.. also extremely overpriced payed 8.5 euro for half Amstel bock

59,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,4 years ago,We have spent over ‚Ç¨150 tonight on drinks here but we still have to pay the woman 50¬¢ to empty our bladders here. Avoid.
60,Caf√© Emmelot, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Besides being expensive, the Mojito we ordered resembled a low budget lemonade with no rum. Disappointed is an understatement."
