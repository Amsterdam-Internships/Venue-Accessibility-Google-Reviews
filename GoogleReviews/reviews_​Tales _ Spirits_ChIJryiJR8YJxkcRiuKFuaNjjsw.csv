13,​Tales & Spirits, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Super nice barmen and personnel. The cocktails are served in great vintage glasses.  The menu is written so nice and attractive. It is a seated bar so you might need to wait outside.
14,​Tales & Spirits, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing service along with amazing cocktails.  The presentation of the drinks is quirky and the flavours are balanced and interesting. It is a little bit pricey but worth it. My only complaint is the menu is difficult to read because the pages are thick cardboard.

19,​Tales & Spirits, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This spot is fantastic. The cocktails are inventive and delicious. Inside of the bar is a tight fit for big groups but they handle it well by making sure they seat folks. They are particular about seating with coats off due to space which isn't a big deal as you can see where your coat wanders off to. Enjoy this place immensely!
20,​Tales & Spirits, 2 stars ,6 months ago,Atmosphere is good. Nice music. Service was not to good. My expectation is that a person sitting at the bar with an empty glas should get asked for another drink. It took a while to get the attention of the mixologist. The cocktails are …

36,​Tales & Spirits, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really great cocktail bar. The place was busy, but the staff was really nice and made an extra table for us. Then when a real table opened up, moved us over. The cocktails were delicious and well made. The zombie will mess you up. I highly recommend it."
37,​Tales & Spirits, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Easily our favorite drinking establishment in Amsterdam. Convenient location aside, the vibe, the look, and the bartenders were all superb. Couldn't recommend this place any more fervently."

60,​Tales & Spirits, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The Van Gogh painting cocktail was pretty clever and cute! It lacked balance and was too absinthe forward which overpowered any of the sweeter notes in the cocktail but at least the presentation was nice.
61,​Tales & Spirits, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Flawless and quick service - been taken care of, together with coats being handled for us, from the moment we entered through the door.

126,​Tales & Spirits, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great, quiet bar with fantastic cocktails and great service. They got my total love after they provided water all night long and stated 'we don't want you to get drunk'. No, the idea is to fully enjoy their drinks that are like small pieces of art."
127,​Tales & Spirits, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Absolutely adorable bar & creative drinks! It’s so cozy and the staff are professional but treat you like you’re a friend. Someone hung up our coats and scarves for us as soon as we walked in and seated us warmly!

145,​Tales & Spirits, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"I like this place - they're always ready to listen to your cravings and come up with something unusual and fascinating.
