0,FEBO, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Quick Dutch food from a vending machine style of kitchen. Burgers are for sure too pricey for what you get.
1,FEBO, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Staff very friendly and conveniently close to the NH Amsterdam North hotel. But the softice icecream cone was very mediocre ... ice not so creamy and cone stale. However it is convenient that they have toilets.
