0,Café Oporto, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We also got lunch at lunch time without booking.
Ordered, clean, polite and helpful staff. The quality and quantity of the food ordered is adequate. A delicious blend of flavors and spices. …"
1,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is great, I tasted tree dishes the best one was the beef Wellington, the price is above the average for Porto (2x more). The service after I sit was very good. You need to made a reservation, they are very annoying about this."
2,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delightful culinary experience. From the classic interior to the friendly and very attentive staff, I couldn't have been happier to stop by in this comfy café after visiting the Foz do Douro. Everything was on point and the prices here are fair. I will come back every time I visit the beautiful city of Porto."
3,Café Oporto, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food very average, not worth the price. Decor nice enough. Fish not fresh despite being on coast. Front of house staff don't really care about the customers. Presumably they know due to location they will always get punters, so the restaurants reputation doesn't matter. Avoid if possible."
4,Café Oporto, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Looks nice but food was poor quality.  In this restaurant, menu says roast beef with spinach and French fries.  Reality.... cold blue meat, lidil own spinach and a bag of crisps tipped on the plate!!  I'm not joking!Nice window seats only …"
5,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"On a recent business trip and was invited to dinner by our business partner as this place is one of his favourites. The starters was delicious; a mushroom dish, some stuffed spring rolls type of thing and some gorgeous clams. I had the …"
6,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere, great food, great service... We're happy!"
7,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Wonderful staff and beautiful interior location. Has a striped blue and white classic beachy feel with wicker seats. You feel like you're in a movie scene. Perfect place to stop in when you're near the ocean front and park. The food is delicious and plentiful. Try the beef wellington, it's amazing!"
8,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Came across this lovely restaurant by chance at lunchtime in a great location near the quay. Its an attractive location with friendly professional staff and we had the lovely 3 course Executive menu (including a glass of very  nice house wine). Buzzy atmosphere - would definitely go again.
9,Café Oporto, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great view, nice walking area. Food ok."
10,Café Oporto, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Good restaurant with a great view and nice finger food to enjoy before dinner. We came early, and the full menu was not available, but the chef was kind enough to prepare a schnitzel for the children. There was also some nice snacks available to choose from, to just sit and enjoy an evening with a glass of port wine."
11,Café Oporto, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"The terrace is quite small and has glass windows, which kind of ruins the view. The food was nothing special, but it wasn't awful either. For the price, though, which was about 20€/person, I would expect much better. This was more like a 10€ meal."
12,Café Oporto, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Location and views are great, service is attentive and nice, but food was underwhelming. The food presentation needs work, it's not to the level of the rest of the place. …"
13,Café Oporto, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Service REALLY slow when asking for the daily menu. The main dish had fries that seemed to be done several hours ago. Not a good sign, honestly for such a ‘good’ restaurant. Size of the food small at least for the daily menu"
14,Café Oporto, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I got food poisoning from the prawn salad (12 euros). I went around 3 PM so it might have been because the restaurant was closing soon and the prawns were sitting out all day but still, it should be fresh. Also, the waitress was rude. No intentions of returning."
15,Café Oporto, 1 star ,4 years ago,I was in shock!!! Extremely greedy and unfriendly service. I haven't get a place till i confirm that i will have order full lunch menu. You could find more friendly service on much much lower price. it is better to buy some coffee and sweets before you go.
16,Café Oporto, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not even a smile, stressed out personal, and had to wait 24 minutes for a prawn salad,  I got it because my wife asked for it, otherwise I would have had to wait longer. Nice location,  but poor service."
17,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,3 years ago,What a gem. Incredible sea bass which was huge. Freshly squeezed orange juice. Everything we ordered was superb and fresh which isn't the case all too often (especially in the UK). Five out of five.
18,Café Oporto, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Very pleasant place to have a good meal of some traditional dishes with a twist. Nice starters and desserts. Not as expensive as you would expect at a restaurant in this location.
19,Café Oporto, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really tasty food. It’s also a nice place to be, the waiter was friendly and it’s actually affordable. Good price for good food. I would recommend anyone staying in the area or have visited the beach to stop off here."
20,Café Oporto, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The food is bad, except the beef, which is ok, nevertheless for 25€/plate I would expect a great, not an ok. The service was bad also, not professional nor friendly, the feeling was: ""You're lucky we are serving you""! Expensive and …"
21,Café Oporto, 1 star ,4 years ago,Stuck-up staff that don't care for their customers. Tables and cutlery dirty (you ask for a clean fork and they ignore you and never bring it) and overall bad atmosphere. Don't go here if you want to have a good time.
22,Café Oporto, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Extremely rude waiters. Prices two times higher than at any quality restaurant in Ribeira or Bolhão. On top of everything, a meal from this place gave me a food poisoning. Avoid at all costs!!!"
23,Café Oporto, 1 star ,2 years ago,There were only three tables occupied and three waiters. We waited around 5 minutes to get a menu. We didn't get it. So we left. Worst waiters ever...
24,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Loved the place.  Loved the caring service even if we struggled to understand each other!  Great food.
25,Café Oporto, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Steak tartar is total mess. Meat is completely homogeneous while spices undercrushed. Waste of ingredients and shame for its price.
26,Café Oporto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great food and superb dessert! Located close to the sea,  with great view. The street outside do not have much traffic at night."
27,Café Oporto, 1 star ,3 years ago,"rude attendants! we came with a stroller, our little baby was sleeping in it. staff did not lead to the table, did not help open the door, pushed the stroller past. We went from there and never come back!"

31,Café Oporto, 2 stars ,3 years ago,A totally average restaurant wrapped in a cute wrapping. Pretentious and way too expensive for what you are being served. A real place for tourists...
