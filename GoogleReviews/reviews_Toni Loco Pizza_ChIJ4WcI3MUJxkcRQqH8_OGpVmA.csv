0,Toni Loco Pizza, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Been to Toni Loco for the second time. The three of us had ordered a 50 cm pizza. One half Margherita and the other half with Pepperoni. Really delicious! The pizza baker was very friendly. He advised us to take a 50cm pizza. It's a small ‚Ä¶
1,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"The pizza Toni Loco is the best the thin crust which is delicious the pizza is really tasty i love the design of the pizzeria, and the service is really nice ! the employees of the pizzeria are really kind !"
2,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Excellent pizza and Italian beer; love this place
We had a great lunch here"
3,Toni Loco Pizza, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"This isn‚Äôt pizza slice culture/ sesame seeds in the crust, come on ! / 4.25 for slice with pepperoni? 30 plus for pie. It feels like they missed  the point of what westernized pizza culture should be. Big, cheap and tasty !!"
4,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,6 months ago,We are italians and the pizza is actually like one you would eat in Italy. We also assisted to a pizza-making lesson to Toni‚Äôs new employee and witnessed his true dedication to the cause. Totally recommended.
5,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizza is pretty fantastic. The sesame crust is different enough to be refreshing, but familiar enough to be satisfying. The base of the pie is thin, but still strong to hold together. 50cm pie is good for 2 hungry people or 3 if you're not ‚Ä¶"
6,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,7 months ago,I had an amazing experience with Toni Loco. My order was quite special and we stayed in touch throughout the week to make sure everything went smoothly. They were super helpful in customising to my needs. The ever-lasting positivity and of course the delicious pizzas deserve 5/5.üôåüèª
7,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Great big pizza, and the guys are so nice! Very good value for the price."
8,Toni Loco Pizza, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We ordered pizza slices that were pre-made. Cheese and pepperoni. Both were good. The two guys working were super friendly and nice. Love the interior. Very cool and well-thought-out design with all of the metal and color red.
9,Toni Loco Pizza, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"They were happy to help me with any request I had for my pizza! Great taste, cool open kitchen and nice staff! They really make a piece of art out of every pizza! ‚Ä¶"
10,Toni Loco Pizza, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Was a good pizza, and two people can even easily eat the smaller size together. Sesame crust is something new to pizzas, but kind of fits."
11,Toni Loco Pizza, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I have had pizza delivered and come here to pick-up pizza. Pizza is great either way but order handing was not good enough when actually showing up. Staff is friendly but ordering for delivery is really worth it (26 EUR for pick-up 28 for ‚Ä¶
12,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent pizza.... small,  Comfortable space..only 4 tables, but nice....  Pizza by the slice or whole pies...  Will be back!"
13,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is my favorite pizza in Amsterdam, thanks largely to the perfect sesame seed crust. It‚Äôs very distinctive and not something I‚Äôve been able to find very easily. Friendly employees, also!"

15,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really friendly staff. The pizza was also delicious!
16,Toni Loco Pizza, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Pizza of the month with ""truffle"". I needed a magnifying glass to find them. Barely no cheese, arrived cold. Also super expensive. Almost ‚Ç¨20. I'm not going to order again."
17,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good Italian pizza place. Italians running it and serving you authentic Italian pizza. ‚Ä¶
18,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, delicious pizza. The closest thing to a real New York pizza shop outside of the US. The dough is thin crust and foldable, sauce a bit sweet‚Äîjust the way it‚Äôs supposed to be. We got the chef‚Äôs choice, a massive 50cm/20in pizza ‚Ä¶"

The staff was super nice and the prices were affordable. 10/10 would dine again."
22,Toni Loco Pizza, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Third class customer service by an Italian looking, tattoo staff. Was so rude and there is no hygiene maintained by him. I will never go to this rude behaviour restaurant. Totally unacceptable."

27,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Really good quality pizza and it definitely differentiates to other pizza standards, my personal favourite in Amsterdam"
28,Toni Loco Pizza, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Small seats not made for Dutch people. The staff was friendly and the pizza pretty good but a packed restaurant would make things get uncomfortable real quick, especially with tall/big Dutchies like me."

30,Toni Loco Pizza, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious pizza's and great service. No matter how big the pizza is... you cannot resist to eat all slices ;)
31,Toni Loco Pizza, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Well, Toni Loco‚Äôs pizza is not even near as good as any dollar slice pizza in NYC üòÇ
