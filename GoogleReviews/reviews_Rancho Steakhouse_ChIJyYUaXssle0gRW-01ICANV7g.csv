58,Rancho Steakhouse, 1 star ,2 years ago,Waited about 2 hours for an over cooked lump of gristle that bore a strong resemblance to a tramps sandal which they laughably called a rare sirloin. Staff were friendly but far too few to cope. Far and away the worst food ive had in a long time although to be completly fair others in my party had better quality of steak.
59,Rancho Steakhouse, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Lots of positive reviews but mine based on the set menu...... Steak ok, salad abismal, chips dripping in fat. Starter mediocre. Our waiter Michael very nice chap but for me when the battle of the 2 courses on south road, this one is woefully poor"
