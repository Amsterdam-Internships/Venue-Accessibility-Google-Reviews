They usher you in politely but aren't pushy. Authentic Argentinian food with …"
2,La Boca, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Lovely place to dine. The employees and owner were all very lovely and really gave the space to look at the menu (not rushing). The food came quite quick and was tender and warm. Really good meat! Just a lovely athmosphere. I have been here a few times before and I will defenitly come back!
3,La Boca, 1 star ,3 months ago,They do not accept American vaccination card … hi has nobody on the restaurant and he didn’t let me in because I haven’t a European code … if the country accept  the American vaccination card It doesn’t make sense that this ridiculous owner …
4,La Boca, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Ambiente is fine.
Cocktails for 10€ each is okay.

5,La Boca, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great staff, great food and prices not too bad either. Highly recommend the mixed grill that came out with hot charcoal and the best cuts of meat. Finished with pancakes with fresh strawberries and cream! Will definitely be returning. Thanks."
6,La Boca, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Kind staff, service was fast. You don't need to wait so long time. Would welcome more space, we luckily catched a seat. We chose a 3-dish menu (soup/calamares, beef/chicken/salmon and desert coffee or icecream). Prices are normal, as in other restaurants in Amsterdam. We paid totally 38 euros for drinks and 2 menus."
7,La Boca, 1 star ,3 months ago,More than a hour for 2 starters. They totally forgot my food but didn't accept any complains. Unpolite staff. Children are not welcome.
8,La Boca, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"If you go here get the platter! Not my favorite place in Amsterdam but I would eat there again. As long as you get the 5 meat platter pictured below, your money will be well spent. Otherwise it's a tad on the expensive side. Staff was nice and helpful. Very cool and central location for those checking out the city center as well!"
9,La Boca, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff very friendly, fast service. Food is OK.... By my opinion portions could be little bit bigger. Staff speaking multiple language. Meet is tasty and fresh."

12,La Boca, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Nice food for a good price. Friendly staff member
13,La Boca, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good Argentinian restaurant in this very dense area. The staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to make you comfortable. They have many great options for food with different combinations of meat. The Ancho Pincho and Ancho de …
14,La Boca, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"i ate there only the spare ribs and it was amazing and HUGE. you could easily share it with a friend. otherwise, the drinks are pretty expensive and they don't serve tap water on purpose, so you have to buy a drink. that is a but unfair so it's a 1-star lose for them."
15,La Boca, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Had lunch here today gnocchi was very nice and filling. Seating is a little tight but fine

21,La Boca, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Everyone very friendly and nice deals and food excellent.

I would strongly recommend this Argentina house!"
22,La Boca, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Unpleasant place. It was completely empty and we said that we wanted to order some drinks and use the bathroom. He answered ""the bathroom is only for customers"". We repeated that we were actually going to order as well but he said that he didn't serve just drinks and that we had to order food first to be served at all."
23,La Boca, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The meat was tasty and well prepared. The quality of the meat was very good.
24,La Boca, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Ok food, the prices are fair for the area, it is a clean restaurant, it can be crowded in weekends, from you order your food, it doesn't take long before it is ready, the service is fast and very friendly"
25,La Boca, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Not much to complain. Service good, food good, prices okay. (Mixed grill for two on the photo)"
26,La Boca, 1 star ,a year ago,"Neither salad nor burger had a sauce.
The salad was simply from the supermarket with a lemon, the fries were soft and when we got asked how we liked the food he wanted to argue although we agreed to …"
27,La Boca, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great meat: all kinds of meat that four of us tried was perfect: steaks, lamp and even chicken nuggets from the kids menu were fantastic. House wine was also worth testing. Nice attitude and family like atmosphere made our evening."

35,La Boca, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I just spent 20 euros for a small coke, a tasteless hamburger and some chips. The guy came in the end with a inseparable bill saying it is for their convenience, and each ketchup bag added on 0.5 euros. Great, despite each meal comes with …"

38,La Boca, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We ate here today, the food is ok nothing especial and certainly not authentic argentine. Note: I ordered the pancakes which in the picture had strawberries, bananas, and chocolate and were priced at €4.50 - when the bill arrived they …"
39,La Boca, 2 stars ,10 years ago,"Dropped by this place while on vacation in Amsterdam.  Wasn't that impressed.  They had displayed outside a lunch menu that seemed to offer decent prices and options, but it didn't actually call out that is was just the ""lunch"" menu so once …"

44,La Boca, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"If you want to eat the meat this place is perfect. Restaurant in the heart of city center, great food (ribs and steak) with normal service and price (ribs with salad and fri-potato around 11 euro). A little bit old interior but it looks like need to."
45,La Boca, 1 star ,6 years ago,"The only thing on the dessert menu that sounded interesting albeit pretty expensive (7.50€) was the 3-flavor-sorbet. We go for it. Waitress comes with a pink slimey thing and we wonder how on earth a 3-flavor-sorbet has only one color, so I …"
46,La Boca, 1 star ,2 years ago,We went for the English breakfast was disgusting food was cold. Very slow service. We asked if they could remove certain things from the English breakfast the waiter agreed then when it came to the food being brought out they were still on the plate would not recommend! Disappointed

48,La Boca, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I'll make this simple. It was great. 4 of us, 4 different entrees, all very, very good. If you're near The Dam Square and looking for a good Steakhouse, this is the one. Echt Lekker!"
49,La Boca, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Friendly staff and decent food.
50,La Boca, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Not really a good place to go. The service is little bit slow, and the menu is poor. The place is also dirty, I had a really bad experience there, and this could may influence my feelings, but in general I don't suggest this place to firends or enemies."
51,La Boca, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious Argentine steaks and friendly service, but the two big televisions could well be turned off so the male waiters were more attentive of the guests."
52,La Boca, 1 star ,4 years ago,"All the photos on the menu are bluff. So tiny dish, so lousy salad and 100 CC bottle of cola...coasts like 4 people meal in burger king. Don't go there."

56,La Boca, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food, but very expensive. Burger comes without any vegetables, which is kind of ridiculous. Save your money and go to a different steak House nearby."
57,La Boca, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The burger was great but the carpaccio was not special. Anyway, the waiters are friendly and they serve you in no time."
58,La Boca, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food, staff @not ott prices."
59,La Boca, 2 stars ,8 years ago,Came here with my girlfriend based in previous good reviews but my advice is to look elsewhere. The place itself isn't very appealing and the food was poorly cooked and flavourless. Spend your money elsewhere.
