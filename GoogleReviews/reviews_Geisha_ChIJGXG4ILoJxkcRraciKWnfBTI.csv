0,Geisha, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Classy, minimilist styling. Japanese Chinese fusion? Lovely blended ingredients with a modern take on dim sum. Food pricey but high end ingredients, drinks fairly priced."
1,Geisha, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Just incredible delicious!
And very friendly service team.
Try the tasting menu or the whole menu ;-)"
2,Geisha, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Friendly staff that helped us excellently. The food was amazing. The fusion of lemongrass in crème brûlée and ginger in icecream, it was very subtle but SUPER NICE!!!"
3,Geisha, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Very, very good Sushi-Restaurant near Amsterdam Centraal Station. Modern and inviting ambience, friendly service, acceptable prices AND maybe the best sushi I ever had. …"
4,Geisha, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This restaurant also doubles as a lounge bar, but as this place is large it doesn't matter. A cozy interior helps you forget the rain outside... The menu is half sushi, half Chinese, and we had the Chinese part: very good dim sum followed by a chicken with five spices and Chinese noodles - exquisite!"
5,Geisha, 5 stars ,8 months ago,The sushis and dim sum were simply delicious. Fresh made on the spot and perfect balances of taste. We absolutely loved it. Service was not only efficient but also pleasant and discreet. Highly recommend.
6,Geisha, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing Sushi! Best Sushi in town
7,Geisha, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, very nicely presented. The atmosphere here is very nice and calm. The waitress seemed to have good knowledge of allergies, and provided me with a great meal which was also gluten free!"
8,Geisha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Did you know this is a Michelin-rated restaurant?  The service was great and food was yummy!  Definitely worth checking if you’re in around the area.
9,Geisha, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Food is good, however service is the worst I have ever seen, especially for that price. They charge tab water and I had to wait for a food 2 hours and they delivered food 10 mins before closing time."
10,Geisha, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A-ma-zing. We took the 3-gangen menu. Sushi: so tasteful. Dimsum: yum. Fish:wauw. And after a wonderful cocktail by Porum which is connected so they come and bring it to your table. We will be back!
11,Geisha, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Exquisite. Best in class service. The freshest food, both traditional and trending, with such articulate presentation."
12,Geisha, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice place with beautiful and tasteful japanese dishes. A bit pricey but the service is top notch.
13,Geisha, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really nice place, staff was very friendly. Small dishes were really nice. The main (meat) dishes were great but cold, could be easily solved by preheating the plate"
14,Geisha, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice and classy place. Great sushi and dim sum. Spicy tuna roll was our favorite.
15,Geisha, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food, well located. Dishes very well presented."
16,Geisha, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Food is very good. Especially the sushi. I liked the plating, it was very beautiful. Service was average and just awkward. My friend doesn’t speak Dutch, we asked for an English menu and they didn’t have one. Expect from a place like this …"
17,Geisha, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing atmosphere, awesome food and great service"
18,Geisha, 1 star ,a year ago,"Received delivery, and I wasn't able to give a review on the app. I don't understand how this has such a high rating. The sushi was not fresh. I've eaten grocery store tuna maki and been happy about it, but I had to spit this out. The fish …"
19,Geisha, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very tasty. Very calm and relaxing environment. Perfect for dinner. Recommended.
20,Geisha, 2 stars ,3 months ago,They are serving very slow. It took 2h to get food
21,Geisha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, lovely food, convenient to central station.  We had a banquet for 9 people which all enjoyed.  The waiter was very careful about allergies and promptly swapped out anything we couldn't eat.  Nice decor.  Highly recommended"
22,Geisha, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing sushi! Excellent quality!
23,Geisha, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Reading the other reviews, I think this restaurant is overrated. Shared dining concept, small dishes, high price. In terms of taste, it's mediocre. You would expect more for the price. Staff seems not trained well. It gives the impression …"
24,Geisha, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"An immensely disappointing experience. I was here recently for a large work dinner, requiring us to have the set meal. Avoid at all cost. We had a starter of sushi which was good however we then waited for 45 minutes until we were served a …"
25,Geisha, 5 stars ,6 years ago,This restaurant is quite easy to miss being that it's off of the main tourist thoroughfare but I would recommend taking the short walk away from the cafes and bars to enjoy a great meal. …
26,Geisha, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A bit disappointed.
The seafood salad is quite refreshing and well-done with the heat of the scallop&shrimp balancing the leaves. However the sushi quality is unremarkable (rice …"
27,Geisha, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had the vegetarian sushi and dim sums and both were amazing. The Thai curry however wasn’t something that I relished too much. There were a lot of veggies but the curry itself was very little which made it not so interesting. However must …
28,Geisha, 5 stars ,a year ago,Delicious but 100% worth it 🙂
29,Geisha, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wonderful experience in every aspect.  Very cool ambiance. I would suggest the back dining room.  Nice menu.  All food extremely fresh and fantastic.  We ordered chefs menu, and loved it.  Service also great.  Would highly recommend."
30,Geisha, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Poor value for money
We had the Sushi platter and a number of other dishes (e.g. dumplings with Kobe beef). The sushi was okay, but it seemed that the fish was not entirely fresh. …"
31,Geisha, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice spot with good dishes, pricey but worthy of special occasions. Also good service!
The dessert was the least outstanding course. Overall 4* 😉"
32,Geisha, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Went here for dinner on a Thursday night as was in Amsterdam for a layover. Decided to try the Chefs tasting menu (4 course) as it stated this was a blend of Geisha’s signature dishes and new creations. Firstly, the 4 courses took over 2.5 …"
33,Geisha, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Well, actually it was very hard to decide was it 5 or 4 stars, but I would tell 4 on the end. We booked dinner smoothly, staff was very polite, recommendation for sake was perfect. Atmosphere in the restoran in lower part was perfect, …"
34,Geisha, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Very nice place. They could handle all vegan requests.

36,Geisha, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"In summary; the dishes are not real of real Asian cuisine but the sushi is still good. Plain rice is Jasmine, the tempura was flat, barely crispy and came with sweet & sour sauce."
37,Geisha, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Good restaurant reasonably priced although portions aren't big the food is good quality and very tasty. We usually opt for the chef's surprise menu as there is too many good things on the menu to choose from!

39,Geisha, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great flavours, good atmosphere and a menu that makes you want yo visit again."
40,Geisha, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice asian restaurant mixing Japanese and Thaï cooking. An interesting expérience with a good ratio quality/price. The room is à little bit noisy.
41,Geisha, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Came here with a few colleagues for a work meal and was pleasantly surprised. I was the only vegan in our group and the staff went above and beyond letting me know all the vegan options I could have.

43,Geisha, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The Beijing pancakes and spicy tuna rolls were quite tasty but the other dishes we tried were less so. Portions were quite small for the price.
44,Geisha, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"All the food was great, rare to find a place where all the food tastes good. Only hasstle was the waiting time, otherwise everything was great hanging from staff all the way to appearance."
