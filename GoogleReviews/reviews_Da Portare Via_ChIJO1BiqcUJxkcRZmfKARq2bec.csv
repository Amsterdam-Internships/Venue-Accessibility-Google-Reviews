0,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"There is no shortage of delicious vegan food in Amsterdam. However, VIA is the BEST place in the entire city. When I came to Amsterdam five years ago, I loved this place. I returned this week and found it again on a walk near the Anne Frank ‚Ä¶"
1,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The pizza was amazing .... the staff were terrific ... the service and the cooking time were absolutely flawless. Pair of lovely girls running the place made the pizza even more enjoyable ... I will recommend everyone visiting Amsterdam to pay them a visit. A*******
2,Da Portare Via, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Margherita pizza... with literally two leafs of basil. The veggie pizza was pretty tasty, but doesn't make up for the blatant margherita mishap."
3,Da Portare Via, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The pizzas are really tasty, however I had come before and really liked it but I think now it is run by different people and I am a bit disappointed.  I bought a ""normal"" size pizza for 12.50 and it turned out to be the size of an ‚Ä¶"
4,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is one of several wood fired pizzerias by the same name and owner. The place is tiny. There is a small counter along the window facing the street with four seats....thats the entire capacity of the place. You step in, order your pizza ‚Ä¶"
5,Da Portare Via, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The tomato sauce is super tasty. Staff friendly and gives good advices.
6,Da Portare Via, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The pizza was fantastic; the ingredients seem to be high-quality, everything tasted quite good, and the portion size was perfect to leave me sated but not sluggish (I had one normal pizza, which is four slices). No complaints about the ‚Ä¶"
7,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super place to get a pizza. There are no tables inside, only the oven and cash machine. Pizza is made just in front of your eyes, which also means you might need to wait ~20 minutes. You can get a number and walk around, bring the number ‚Ä¶"
8,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wood fired pizza.. we got the tartufo and it was super delicious! The staff were really nice and had lots of suggestions for us. Pizza came out really fast and it was super light and crisp. Would definitely come back!
9,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Coming from a New Yorker . . . this was the best pizza we had in Amsterdam!  Owners/girls were extremely friendly, and each pie was made fresh to order.  Great location to sit outside and eat your ""pizza pie"" and connect to free WiFi."
10,Da Portare Via, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Chill takeaway pizza at a great location. No real seating if you happen to be touring the city, as it's designed for takeaway, but the quality is still excellent for what it is. Recommended!"
11,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really good pizza! They make the pizzas in front of you. They were also nice enough to customize the pizzas to make it vegan. ‚Ä¶
12,Da Portare Via, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Amsterdam has a number of truly excellent pizzerie and this is not one of them. Prices are as high as the competition but no prime ingredients like mozzarella di bufala. The thin crust is just disappointing and the tomato sauce is just out of a can. Go to ‚Äòsotto‚Äô or ,al fuoco vivo‚Äô instead."
13,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Giovanni makes the best pizza in the world. The dough is crusty, slim and wood oven baked. The filling is the best of fresh ingredients. It‚Äôs a true Roman pizza. It‚Äôs a take away, but with a balcon with stools for 5 people. Definitely worth popping in. Un abbracio Giovanni sei il migliore. Bravissimo. Mel and Davide"
14,Da Portare Via, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I didn't like the pizza. It had good ingredients and all, but it was just a saucy pizza with patches of cheese, very small patches. Maybe next time I'll order something besides the margherita to get more flavors?"
15,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great stone baked pizzas at a good price. Staff are friendly, prep time is quick. You can see your pizza get made!"
16,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"They work hard to keep their waiting time down, but popular as they are still require the occasional 20 min wait. Great pizza, good price, no seating past a few stools."
17,Da Portare Via, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"Our experience was not so good. we had a nice pizza ""sofia"" all ok, tasty. also we eat a ""tartufi con coppa di parma"" and black truffel it's just not there. we ask about it and they said was ""in the sauce"". well in the sauce could be ‚Ä¶"

19,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Stopped in for a light lunch and everything was great! Had the calabrese and margherita pizzeta mezzaluna. They were fresh, delicious and perfectly sized for lunch. Price was good. And service was very friendly and fast."
20,Da Portare Via, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Pizza toppings were tastey and fresh. Base was thin and too crispy/fragile.
Also took a while to come out of the kitchen and nowhere to sit in."
21,Da Portare Via, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I like that the pizza is light and pretty Italian. It's affordable too. It's a tiny space inside so sit along the canal!

25,Da Portare Via, 1 star ,5 years ago,"It's a tiny place with no tables yet no one even looked or acknowledged us for five minutes. And the when I asked for some service, they said they were too busy. Needless to say there are far better places in Amsterdam for pizza."
