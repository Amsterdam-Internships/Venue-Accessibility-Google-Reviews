1,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Food is really good and the combinations are interesting and tasty.
Waiting time is a bit too long. The kitchen looks great.
Also the cheesecake was unusual and amazing."
2,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 months ago,The french toast was as original as it was delicious! An explosion of different textures and taste. I enjoyed every bite and it helped me forgetting the cappuccino that I ordered earlier and that was only lukewarm.
3,Little Collins, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Love its location and the service there, polite with smiling. I think the aubergine was good, but the cilbir was just soso, we ordered the fig leaves soda drinks, first tasted just like sparkling water, and found out it was not stirred ‚Ä¶"

16,Little Collins, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very well situated near the market, in the heart of the vibrant Pijp area, this restaurant offers some interesting brunch dishes with an Asian/Indian touch to it which are all very tasty! The drinks are also really good."

23,Little Collins, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Amazing menu, and the people there are lovely! The brisket and the sausage were outstanding!"
24,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place to have some original brunch dishes near Albert Cuyp market. Not very big but also not too crowded on a weekday. In the weekends it can get quite busy with people waiting for tables. Staff are very friendly and do their best to ‚Ä¶
25,Little Collins, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Ok, I couldn't wait to leave my review here cause my experience had two sides. I was tempted to give it 2 stars but then it would have not bene fair for the food. In fact, food is really good. I went there with my boyfriend to have brunch ‚Ä¶"
26,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It's cozy and modern restaurants that I they serve different flavors of food. I recommend you to try it. It's also 16 m away from the Van Gogh Museum if you are walking to it
27,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We had a really good breakfast. All very tasty. If u dont want to wait you should come earlier. The stuff was friendly. Service is not very fast but it's open kitchen so u see all the process which is nice. We ordered  Kimchi plate which was quite big so better to share it.
28,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a cute place with some good food and really friendly staff. Dishes were a good mix of carefully crafted ingredients. The Potato flatbread (like an Indian aloo Parantha) was absolutely delicious. The bread was nice and flaky, with just ‚Ä¶"
29,Little Collins, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The Food there is amazing. Super delicious and healthy. Quite pricey unfortunately for the amount you get.
The service is ok. Also a minus is the seating arrangement. Inside they have very limited spots and you cannot make a reservation which is why I am only giving 4 stars."
30,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Simply a must in the Pijp! Quality maintained since 4 years.

Just go for it."
31,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Loved the place! The food was so damn good and the chai latte heavenly ü§©

33,Little Collins, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great food! Would love to come back one day.
34,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Everything on the menu looks amazing and the things our table had all tasted fantastic. Very busy on the weekend and quite cozy but well worth going out of the way for. ‚Ä¶
35,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"What a fantastic place for a late lunch. The service was brilliant, super friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating of any special requests (they made me a special Special, which was divine). And you have to try the homemade iced tea, heavenly!"
36,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent brunch food cooked and served by lovely, welcoming staff. I had the eggs with mushrooms and my partner had beef with hummus and flatbread, followed by delicious cocktails. Definitely give it a try, you won't regret it!"
37,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I've only heard good things about Australia and Melbourne-inspired restaurant Little Collins in De Pijp is the proof! This place is great for brunch, great for dinner, great for coffee, it is simply Great! My favorite dish so far is the ‚Ä¶"
38,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Little Collins cafe was a great taste of home in Australia. The drinks are all very delicious and not the usual drinks at your flat a cafe, there was at least three different bloody Mary drinks to choose from. The smoky bacon one was very ‚Ä¶"
39,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The brunch is absolutely awesome. I decided on coming back again before even finishing the plate. It takes them a little while to prepare the food though. All in all, it is totally recommended."
40,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the best brunches! Great Bloody Mary for a hangover. I would recommend the shakshouka and the eggs with ham and avocado. Nice environment, friendly staff. It can get busy but it‚Äôs worth the wait"
41,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very disappointing! I was left very upset after my meal.

My waffles & bacon were totally burned. ‚Ä¶"
42,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Interesting menu - quirky breakfast dishes. I had the poached egg with labneh and sujuk sausage, sooo good!! Also has delicious coffee. Vibe is chill. Loved it would definitely come back."
43,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice place for a brunch. Be prepared to queue, but spend the time then in the very nice Sparphati Park around the corned. The Hummus dish is great, just like the passion fruit desert. Staff is (often) international and (therefore?) nice!"
44,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,Happy place in De Pijp. Happy and delicious food served by very happy and friendly people. No wonder this place is always crowded. Better make a reservation if you plan to go on busy hours.
45,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"The food here is so good and I don't know why. It's a mix of things I would never think to order, but somehow it all works together so well. Try the Cilbir or Masala eggs. Amazing."
46,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The porkbelly was hands down the best meal I had in a while üòã
So succulent, flavourful, soft yet crunchy omfg I almost ordered another one was it not for the huge bowl of hummus with epic flatbread that preceded it or the creamy duck leg afterü§§ü§§"
47,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,We really enjoyed the tasty and well thought through dishes at this restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great. The drinks are a little overpriced for Amsterdam averages.
48,Little Collins, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Best brunch in the whole city, must have eaten here 100 times and they keep updating the menu just as you are getting a little too used to the dishes. This place NEVER fails"
49,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Make sure to arrive with time or book in advance. Great vibe as you‚Äôd expect in the pijp. Food is also delicious and best for brunch. You‚Äôll not regret a sunny day here.
50,Little Collins, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Food tastes good, however service is really bad. Everything came 40 mins later. It can happen that they forgot. After food we ordered hot beverages and the cups were really dirty. The small milk cup was stained with old milk. The cup had a yellow old milj layer on it. It was really disgusting."
51,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really good breakfast spot! Nice selection of meals on the menu and good coffee to boot. Would definitely go back for a bite to eat
52,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this place,  the food is so good! Everything I've tried here is awesome but I should note I always go for brunch. The chili cauliflower scramble is my favorite. On a weekend it can get busy but they turn tables pretty fast so if ‚Ä¶"
53,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I had the Grazer for brunch and it was delicious! The coffee was good as well, although they (like all the other coffee places I've been to in Amsterdam) have only full and soya milk. ‚Ä¶"
54,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amsterdam doesn't do a lot of brunch, which is where Little Collins shines.

A Melbourne-style menu ranging from waffles to okonomiyaki, or a bloody mary if ‚Ä¶"
55,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was good, the service was excellent. Contrary to a lot of other places in De Pijp where they don't care about service (since they get plenty of tourist customers anyway), Little Collins manages to get it right - their hostess ‚Ä¶"
56,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Delicious food and great choice! We wanted to try everything on the menu! Nice setting with outdoor tables as well on the street. Staff are very friendly and efficient.
57,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect brunch place. Delicious food, nice coffee, great cocktails. Expect a waiting list, at least if you‚Äôre there on Saturday around noon. This place is very popular and definitely worth waiting 30-60 minutes for your table. You can chill in Sarphatipark while waiting, it is right next to Little Collins."
58,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing!

You should definitely visit this place.  Although it is always crowded, it is worth waiting for a free place to visit fine dishes.  And very friendly staff."
59,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We went for an early dinner and had to wait for the kitchen to open at 17h, they close the kitchen from 16h to 17h, even if drinks and snacks are available (we had no lunch that day...), and were lucky to enjoy our amazing lamb, salmon and bruschetta in a quiet atmosphere ! The food was delicious !"
60,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"It‚Äôs a quite popular place, so it‚Äôs a good idea to make a reservation.
The menu is also short, but everything is very tasty."
61,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place was great! Our wait was supposed to be 1 hour but it was only about 45 minutes. The staff was very friendly and the food was amazing! Had the avocado toast and it was so good!!
62,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"So there is a dinner menu, don‚Äôt come for breakfast food at dinner time. Come for dinner. It is really really good with better prices that one would imagine."
63,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place to have brunch on Sunday, might take a bit of queuing time to get seated but it's worth it."
64,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Food, Quality, Price:

65,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very very delicious! Been here once for a dinner and today came for breakfast. And it‚Äôs was something really special! The French toast ‚Äì is a MUST try! Soooo tasty, soooo rich in flavors. The combination of ingredients is very interesting ‚Ä¶"
66,Little Collins, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is very good and the employees are extremely nice.
The menu, however is something else... You have no idea what you order.
I am not crazy about overdoing of the food presentation. It is too much for me, but if you like it, this is a perfect place"
67,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Come here early - when they open at 9 you get a spot and excellent service - at 11 you wait and everything takes twice as long...Anyways, the menu is small but fantastic and they serve you something else than the typical breakfast staples you know from other places - definitely recommendable."
68,Little Collins, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Aloo paratha was hot and crispy, nice!
Waffle hollandaise would be perfect if the waffle can be hot, fluffy, and less salty. A breakfasts for 2 costs 37EUR, a bit pricey.  The ambience is cozy, especially on a rainy day."
69,Little Collins, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Enjoy the service, very welcoming and fun place to be. Even though it‚Äôs one of the best brunch places in terms of food quality around Amsterdam there‚Äôs still place for improvement. The dishes aren‚Äôt that well balanced and they could go easier on the salt:)"
70,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"This was 3 yrs ago and just realised I never left a review.
It was honestly the best brunch I had had in my life!"
71,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Melbourne-style brunche and shared dinner options. I had the Cilbir twice while visiting which was top notch. Decent coffee. Friendly and accommodating staff. Definitely recommend!
72,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Food was really super tasty.
73,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,After 4 trips to Amsterdam I discovered this place and have been blown away! The dishes are inventive (spiced lamb with beet hummus and dill! and kimchi selectively used in a few places) and so dam delicious!! Thinking about going back there for brunch again tomorrow. Must eat!!!
74,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Sweet little spot in the Pijp, definitely worthwhile to enjoy brunch here! We had a salmon and tofu dish accompanied by lots and lots of wine. Boozy brunch it was. We were seated on the terrace in the sun and enjoyed a really nice time. Definitely coming here again, especially when the weather's sunny!"
75,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good coffee, bloody mary excellent service often packed. Ive been to LC several times and always enjoying time, food and vibe over. Love it"
76,Little Collins, 3 stars ,5 months ago,The presentation of the food was very good and the service was quick and friendly. The taste was a 3/5 but the coffee was horrible.
77,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute little spot with outdoor seating. The waffle with hollandaise was amazing! Pairs well with an orange wine.
78,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Brunch is really tasty and the price is ok.
If better reserve a table as it gets very busy."
79,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Very intimate place for a great brunch. Dishes are a perfect combination of different tastes, try to believe!"
80,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Taste was amazing - giant size portions, lots of vegetarian and other preferences marked on the menu card. Proper coffee as well."
81,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best brunch we had in Amsterdam. Big of a wait for a table but they are very well organised and it's defiantly worth the wait. Coffee is good too.
82,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly service, lovely space, and delicious food. Highly recommend the escalivada toast and the kimchi & gruyere scramble (especially with a side of halloumi)!"
83,Little Collins, 5 stars ,7 months ago,One of the best lunch places ever! Their menu is always ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è amazing chai tea. And all their food is really good. They also have another location in West which is equally amazing!
84,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Interesting little spot to have breakfast/brunch.  I had a local beer and a kimchi waffle that was really interesting, but still good.  Neat local style feel and decor."
85,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely delicious brunch. I had a mimosa, cappuccino and the halloumi and brioche French toast with beet, rhubarb, cr√®me fraiche and walnuts. I added avocado on the side and it was perfect. My husband had the waffles (basically eggs ‚Ä¶"
86,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Phenomenal food! Short rib dish is exceptional quite possibly the best meal Ive had thus far in Amsterdam. Portion size is awesome for 14 euro. Soooo good! Plus you can sit in front if the window and watch the peeps go by. Highly recommended and the tunes are great. Awesome find.
87,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great for original breakfast. I really enjoyed my stay during one morning at Little Collins. The staff was super friendly and the vibes of the place is great. The ginger tea was nice and i was refilled with boiled water which was very ‚Ä¶

89,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Thursday morning and we walked straight in and were seated straight away. Drinks came quickly and the food was very tasty. Nice place to quench your brunch hunger.
90,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food and drinks, friendly service and a cute location in de pijp. The dishes are different to the usual brunch spots in Amsterdam. It can be crazy busy but the guys always give their best to help quick. Big like!!"
91,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very solid coffee experience with a seasonal brunch menu - it doesn‚Äôt have your traditional breakie options
92,Little Collins, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Had a lovley brunch here today while sitting outside. We ordered the aubergine dish and the masala scramble (I think that's correct). Both were very good. The bloody mary was okay, but a little on the small side."
93,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of best brunch places in Amsterdam. You should definitely try their gruyere waffles
94,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is nice. But, honestly, the food is too expensive for it's quality and quantity. We order 2 appetizers and one costed 10 Euros for a small chilli pen + 3 tortillas. Even for 1 person is not a good amount."
95,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Good vibe, good service, great food. A small pearl in Amsterdam. For a friendly or a romantic dinner."
96,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great brunch spot! Coffee was good, service was friendly and I had the best eggs Benedict style waffle with the most delicious pickles pickled onions. Gonna be thinking about that meal for a while!! It is quite a big serving so next time I‚Äôd split it and want to try another item as everything sounded yummy."
97,Little Collins, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"A caf√© run by some Australians with some classic Australian brunch options.

102,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The is next to Albert Street market . Its a really good option for breakfast or brunch . The space is small with few outdoor seats in shares table style . The food is good . And coffee as well . Pro tip the clothing store next door is awesome as well
103,Little Collins, 2 stars ,4 years ago,brunch is fine‚Ä¶ but service is unfriendly(especially 1 of the girl)

Mushrooms and eggs were INCREDIBLE . ‚Ä¶"
118,Little Collins, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good brunch place..not a lot of options in the menu. Taste fluctuates a bit with every visit. Loved the food there during my first visit...while the second time it was just blahh..

122,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,Such an amazing place. Love their attention to detail. Service is always kind and welcoming! Brunch place that I will come back to anytime I'm in Amsterdam.
123,Little Collins, 3 stars ,a year ago,Cute place in the pijp with a nice brunch menu. I had the potatoes wafel with pouched eggs and hollandaise sauce. The sauce was way too sour and took over any other flavor of the dish. My friend had the scrambled eggs with mackerel and enjoyed it.
124,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Their Haloumi Plum Salad is probably one of the best dishes I've ever had!! Congrats to the chef and the whole team!
125,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very small menu, but not in a good way, and very expensive. We had the hollandaise waffles with bacon. The bacon was cheap, the waffles were bland and burned which ruined the other flavours. We had to wait half an hour for our table as it ‚Ä¶"
126,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Cozy little place to have a nice chat with friends. Honestly, we didn't find the food and drinks menu worth the hype at all! There were quite some vegan and gluten free options - which I guess is good for the fad that people are after. ‚Ä¶"
127,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolute favourite when on a weekend away in Amsterdam, over the years the menu has only gotten tighter. Recepies mastered and perfected. The waffles are some of the best, and love the fact that they are savoury. Also best poached eggs in ‚Ä¶"

136,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This place.....This place.....
If I could give them 10 stars they would get all of them. Amazin dishes (when open as restaurant) and the sandwiches for take away are outstanding. Service is great and the coffee is on point! Their Spritz is delish!!!"

140,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing brunch place! Had the waffles with the poached eggs and bacon, and it was delicious!! Good coffee, service a bit slow. Very busy place and worth the visit, local markets near by that you walk along on a sat morning."
141,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great brunch selection for meat lovers and vegetarians. Love their espresso martini with salted caramel! Very small menu but with great creative options. Weekends are very busy with 1hr waiting, weekdays is less busy with mostly no waiting time."

145,Little Collins, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great little spot for good quality brunch, especially if you've worked up an appetite beforehand!! Pleasant staff, quick service, water always served without asking, nice."
146,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,What a fantastic little eatery! I seriously think it is the best quality and best tasting food I have had in Amsterdam and I have lived here for over 2 years and eat out a lot. A brilliant discovery. ‚Ä¶
147,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Recommended by locals and very popular among them apparently! They serve brunch until 4pm and the food is real nice (not super-large portions though). It can get busy so expect to be put on the waiting list - you can stroll around the park or get a coffee nearby.
148,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food and nice service. Always crowded but cozy atmosphere. Kimchi bloody Mary is nice but hot hot hot
149,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favourite brunch spots in Amsterdam. Gets a little busy late morning and you might have to wait a little bit to be seated (especially when weather is good) but worth the wait. Food is fantastic and coffee excellent (even though it‚Äôs Melbourne inspired... ;-). Highly recommended.
150,Little Collins, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very friendly staff, very nice atmosphere. It's kind of a place you would enjoy our brunch & coffee. Yet there is nothing special when it comes to dishes although it looks otherwise when you look at the menu. Worth going there once, but I would not go again."
151,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food, amazing coffee, good vibes."
152,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a brunch there, that was good but the quantities are too small given the prices. And even the quality wasn't amazing... Perhaps you've heard about it on social media just like me and would like to give it a try, in my opinion it is definitely not worth waiting to eat there."
153,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food and great people. It really felt like a little slice of Australia and it made me feel like I was back. I'll definitely return for dinner. The lunch was very tasty, pretty substantial sized and the flavour combinations really worked."
154,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,10am on a Sunday and already very busy so get in early or prepare to wait but the food is worth it! The servers did a great job in such a hectic and packed space being polite and helpful. I really like the menu which veers away from your ‚Ä¶
155,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely place, great outgoing staff, meals (to share) are tiny but special. The cocktails finish the job."
156,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Just what a brunch place should be like! Excellent customer service, delicious food, and a great ambience. This should be a yardstick for every cafe in Amsterdam that is trying to label itself as a brunch place. Time to move past toast plus avo"
157,Little Collins, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was great, unfortunately completely undone today by terrible service. Yes I see they are popular and busy, so orders get mishandled and delayed. That's not a reason to give us major attitude when we politely follow up on our order ‚Ä¶"
158,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Excellent dishes...fresh and we'll balanced.
159,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,2nd time going for brunch and doesn‚Äôt disappoint.  Quality food with inventive pairings.  Highly recommend for brunch. It gets busy so be prepared to shop in the area while you wait or show up early!
160,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious food and very friendly service. Cafe was amazing too. Quiet relaxing environment. ‚Ä¶
161,Little Collins, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place, good food and service. Sandwich was tasty."
162,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The menu is pretty short, but all the dishes made me drool. We went for the ""classic but not really"" egg benedict on waffles and we were not disappointed. Omg yum just thinking about it ! ‚Ä¶"
163,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"If you want an excellent brunch in Amsterdam, Little Collins is the place to go. The coffee is fantastic as well as their cocktails if you‚Äôre having one of those mornings. Have been there  countless times and every time my meal and everyone‚Äôs that I‚Äôm with has been amazing."

166,Little Collins, 3 stars ,a year ago,I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs all the buzz about with this place. The food is average. I do agree that the coffee is nice. Some of the staff are great some really not. 3 out of 5 stars to give the benefit of the doubt.
167,Little Collins, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"The atmosphere is absolutely fantastic, very peaceful and classy. The food is delicious. I only ordered vegetarian food and have in my 12 years of vegetarianism never eaten such good vegetarian food. It looked amazing and the tastes were so surprising and delicious. Definitely will go back here and can recommend it to anyone!"
168,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Looking for a great flat white and tasty breakfast, little Collins will take you back home (Australia)"
169,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wow! Blown away by the food here. Service was amazing and the atmosphere was so buzzy and fun. ‚Ä¶
170,Little Collins, 4 stars ,a year ago,"The food was outstanding when we went a year or two years ago. Now its not as good but still ok. The only thing is they don't reserve to terrace and there's only one table for more than two people. Honestly, I wouldnt go again, it's not ‚Ä¶"

172,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Decent little diner for brunch. Hot smoked salmon was lovely. Only lost a star as they'd ran out of IPA.! Located on a much more laid back neighborhood then the bustling centre.
173,Little Collins, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The concept is great, but this is yet another trendy Amsterdam brunch place that has been totally let down by its service. We waited an hour for food despite being only one of 2 tables seated when we arrived. When we asked repeatedly where ‚Ä¶"
174,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Really nice cafe. Seems to be run by Australians, so not necessarily the most authentic Dutch experience, but the food is really good and the staff and service is excellent. Coffee was great and is from a local company that you can visit and see them roasting too (Lot sixty one). Highly recommended for brunch or a coffee"
175,Little Collins, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Staff was nice and the juices great, but the food was kind of tasteless and extremely overpriced. The poached egg was basically raw... 16 euro's for 1 piece of toast with 2 raw eggs is rediculous i think."
176,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It feels like home made food. Good home made food. Love their service and that even although recipes are simple are just yet incredibly tasti. It will be great they would open a Little Collins in Ostdorp - it's only upcoming!
177,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of my favourite Amsterdam restaurants for small plate sharing. There is something for everyone's tastes and they happily make accommodations for allergies like gluten free or nut free. Lots of delicious vegetarian options too. Recommend reservations.
178,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,This place offer all day brunch. Relaxed setting and they offer places outside too. Laid back and friendly staff. He food is perfect hangover food or just a nice brunch during any time of the day. The brunch is a la cart. I can recommend ‚Ä¶
179,Little Collins, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasted at brunch: Very original and very tasty brunch fair. The staff is a little overwhelmed but tries to keep a smile. The obligatory line can be too long... Not sure I think it's worth that long but, if you happen to pass by at a moment when there's little wait, you're sure to have a good meal."
180,Little Collins, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place down in de pijp. Super trendy and super delicious food. We had to wait but went for a nice walk around the park nearby. The place was heaving when we got back, and it felt a little out of control at times, with coffee and a ‚Ä¶"
181,Little Collins, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Overrated restaurant where we had to wait to long for our drinks and breakfast. Although the food was tastefull, the air-conditioning is horrible and we smelled like overcooked bacon the whole day. For me definitely the first and the last time I had breakfast here."
182,Little Collins, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Victim of too much success and not enough man power to sustain it. In the end the staff are blamed for the experience when it‚Äôs not their fault, the wait was ridiculous (an hour for food) and something that is meant to be enjoyable is an ‚Ä¶"

184,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Wonderful brunch with my boyfriend while visiting from the states. I had the avocado toast and he got the French toast, both were to die for. The coffee was great too! I ordered the flat white and he got a latte. Our server spoke English so that was nice too! We will make it a point to come back here when we return."
185,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Cool little Aussie cafe in the Dam. Great coffee!
186,Little Collins, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I must say, the kimchi waffle was really not my taste, but my friend had a pretty great dish (simple avocado and eggs). We were sitting outside and I like the atmosphere and the staff is very nice. Next time I will just order something else."
187,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great cafe with English speaking staff, breakfast is really tasty but a little more expensive than other places in Amsterdam. The coffee is okay, however, could be a little stronger. Restaurant is often very busy so reserving a table is a good idea."
188,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff, yummy food.
Loved the Kimchi Toastie!"
189,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The original aussie style brunch in Amsterdam. Always great dishes on the menu. Expect a line on weekends. Their bloody Mary's have slowly gotten smaller over the years but still good and their staff is sometimes really lost.
190,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food. I would give even 10 stars if I could. Very original menu, finally something different from all the cafes in Amsterdam. Very busy place so be prepared to wait in the long line for a table but definitely worth it."
191,Little Collins, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Been wanting to go here but was pretty disappointed. Busy brunch service, very crowded but we got a table at the bar. My chai latte was nice but my boyfriend's mimosa wasn't bubbly (even though he complained and got a second one, still the ‚Ä¶"

193,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"On our first cold November night in Amsterdam, my wife and I stepped inside Little Colins on a whim and we were met with wonderful food, friendly staff and cosy atmosphere. The delicious food is served in tapas style sharing plates and they have a great selection of local craft beers. I would highly recommend!"
194,Little Collins, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I must say that the food was extremely bad, taste and plate presentation. Not only did I feel disgusted from the food I also had a very upset stomach ...(wont go into graphic details). ‚Ä¶"
195,Little Collins, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Nice cozy atmosphere at the heart of the Pijp. Everyone working there was very helpful and smiley. Food was super tasty! I had the fungi with a couple of poached eggs and I can comfortably say it was right at the top of my list for best brunch in Amsterdam!
196,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Oh, the food is just so good here! It's definitely a hot spot for brunch in De Pijp, so it can get busy from time to time. As they don't take reservations, it can take at least 30mins before you can be seated. Therefore, I would recommend ‚Ä¶"
197,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The waffles are fire!!
198,Little Collins, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice place. They serve really good, healthy dishes. Best to essemble a few dishes to share. You can't really go wrong, all dishes are delicious! Medium-high priced, but you can easily choose a few cheaper dishes to share as well."
199,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We first went on a Friday around lunch and got amazing food and service. Quiet and nice atmosphere. Then we went for Sunday brunch and service was overworked and missed some orders and food was only average. Loud and hectic. So five stars for weekdays and three for the weekend.
200,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Super satisfying lunch and brunch selection. All unusual and kick-ass delicious! French toast with grilled Haloumi. excellent service by attentive waitstaff. kind of a hipster, chill place."
201,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,A perfectly made poached egg on top of a spiced chickpea stew üòÑwith a fresh flaky wedge of roti... Delicious!  I visited during the week and avoided the weekend brunch madness.  Good service and fresh wholesome dishes.  I'll be back üòç
202,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We love the food Little Collins is making everyday. Really fresh and the coffee is great!
203,Little Collins, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"About the only good thing I can say is that the staff was very pleasant, but the meal I had was not very good. I'm not sure why the chef thought that layering long thin slices of bland zucchini over toasted rye with cream cheese was a good ‚Ä¶"
204,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Still the best brunch in town! Get there early as it gets busy from 11. Menu changes frequently and is not the same as they location in west which gives you a reason to try both and the service is very friendly albeit a bit chaotic from time to time.  (Tip: If you.loke your flat white hot you should specify)
205,Little Collins, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Smallish menu of excellent dishes, friendly staff and a relaxed atmosphere. If you want to eat outside expect a wait when it is hot or you can share with the locals as we did. Definitely a place that has found a local following."

209,Little Collins, 3 stars ,5 years ago,The food is definitely the winner here - nice menu with good variety but the coffee was definitely below expectations and not to the standard of many other new cafes opening in Amsterdam. The place is also in desperate need of ventilation - way too much smoke wafting from the kitchen into the cafe.
210,Little Collins, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Waited for 45 minutes from ordering to being served breakfast. Think this was due to the 3 ladies serving us being a bit confused! They even mucked up our order - bill included stuff we didn't order. Granola &yoghurt was delicious. Prices reasonable. Serve cocktails and spirits at Sunday brunch! Incl. Delicious variations of G&T.
211,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food.  Good sized portions. Coffee art. Service nice, but it takes a little while to get the food. But if you are not in a rush, you are in for a treat!"
212,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best brunch, Australian style (naturally), in Amsterdam by far. And no resorting to the smashed avocado cliches either. Friendly, yet on top of it service, even when busy, which it definitely is after about 10am on weekends."
213,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing food expertly cooked in front of you in the open kitchen and presented beautifully. A fantastically friendly team. Not many covers, so if you want to eat here make sure you get there early. Highly recommend"
214,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"One of my favorite brunch places in Amsterdam. The food is incredible ‚Äì anything with eggs is worth having ‚Äì and their flat whites are always on point. Love the team, spot and just how chill it seems to be compared to the rest of the city."
215,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing brunch menu, Great service and fun for all.... definatly recommend the cheese toastie! Can get very busy so make sure you arrive a bit early or phone ahead to book a table!! Apart from that brilliant place to eat!!!"
216,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I would give this place a solid 4.3. The food is good (not amazing) and it's expensive for what you're getting. There's a bit of a pretentious air to it and taking all this into consideration, it's not worth the long wait. But if you really want a solid brunch place, this will do the trick."
217,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Sensational meals. Get here. Eat them.
I personally had the sausage, bacon and sweet potato waffle dish - with freaking maple syrup on it. A delicious combo I won't forget. ‚Ä¶"
218,Little Collins, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"food was great but it's so noisy and your clothes smell a lot after you've been there. it's definately a in-place and they don't make reservations for brunch. but the food was really tasty, so i might stop by from time to time. a bit pricy though"
219,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic atmosphere and great quality produce. Staff was friendly too
220,Little Collins, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"great brunch spot! good cocktails
They can sometimes have a  wait on weekend mornings/afternoon so be prepared for that. Albert Cuyp Market is right there to walk around if you've got time"
221,Little Collins, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Very, very good brunch menu - not cheap though. My personal favorite ""Carnivore"" with Poached eggs, Stan‚Äôs sausage, bacon, braised legumes, apple and beetroot chutney & sour dough toast is just perfect."

226,Little Collins, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I first walked into Little Collins 2 months ago and since i was new to the area, i had a look at some other cafes in the area but decided to go back as i really liked the service, atmosphere and waiting staff. To my surprise the waitress remembered me and another ""gezellig"" breakfast was had. I can recommend this cafe to anyone."
227,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cute little brunch restaurant in de Pijp. They serve classical dishes like avo on toast, eggs, granola...It always smell kind of greasy, although the place is neat and charming. Be prepared to wait a little if you go on the weekend. There are a few tables outside."

231,Little Collins, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had brunch there on this rainy morning. The place is small and cozy, but got a bit crowded. Tasty food, friendly staff."
232,Little Collins, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Be aware this place is super crowded, and the more people they can jam in the more they will, as long as you're aware of this you'll probably enjoy it. Food was OK but not a good as I hoped, 2 poached eggs one under and one over cooked. Now ‚Ä¶"
233,Little Collins, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent brunch menu. Good looking place. Go early om weekends because it gets crowded early. Service is usually quite slow but the food is de into worth the wait.
234,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"What a great brunch spot. I had the umami omelette: eggs with mackerel, soy vinaigrette, topped with sprouts and greens. Delicious. Go before 10:30 / 11am on a weekend to beat the wait."
235,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff are really friendly and attentive. The food was great, an alternative twist on brunch which I‚Äôm not used to but I‚Äôm glad I tried it! Would go back."
236,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best eateries I visited in Amsterdam. Well worth the journey out of the way to visit it. I wasn‚Äôt feeling a little worse for wear when I went but after eating at Little Collins I certainly perked up!
237,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"we just had breakfast in Little Collins, the food was awesome!
great presentation, great use of fresh products and taste amazing.
Service was prompt and with a smile
definitely coming back"
238,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Put it simply: this place is busy (especially on weekends) because the food is good. The brunch menu is not huge (üëçüèª) and the service is fairly quick (üëçüèª). I will come back.
239,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, generous portions, friendly staff. All you need for a perfect brunch (and they have great vegetarian option, which was a massive plus)."
240,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was tasty but too small portions for the price...at least the dinner menu. Would try it again for brunch as it seems to be quite popular
241,Little Collins, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"Great service, nice spot. Food sounds fantastic on the menu, but was actually not great - some food was almost inedibly over seasoned, and poached eggs were stringy and overdone. Killer bloody Mary's, but ultimately not worth the wait for the table."
242,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing Aussie coffee and delicious food. Service was super quick and friendly, shout-out to our server Alistair who made the experience a standout. Will be coming back for sure!"
243,Little Collins, 3 stars ,2 years ago,So I was recommended to go to this place by some friends. Menu is pretty brief and service is slow. Ingredients are fresh though and the overall taste is good. Seating is rather uncomfortable.
244,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very unusual Australian cafe in de Pijp area of Amsterdam just next to the AlbertCuyp market.   Imaginative tasty food options the likes of which you won't see anywhere else.  Friendly staff, good wine, interesting fresh juice creations and a terrace.  Great place for Sunday brunch."
245,Little Collins, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best breakfast i have had in Amsterdam so far. I like it simple with good coffee. I had coffee which was great, poached eggs, crisp bacon and haloumi which was perfect. Highly recommended."
246,Little Collins, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great spot for brunch and dinner in the Pijp. Dinner is smaller plates that are fun to share with 1-2 others. Nice service and friendly atmosphere. Would recommend making reservations on weekends.
247,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Consistently high quality delicious beautifully presented appetising wonderful food with a chill atmosphere and people. Great eating outside, I just wish the seating would be a little more comfy, ouch!"
248,Little Collins, 5 stars ,a year ago,My girl gets her coffee here every morning and she loves it. I love to see her happy so I also loves it.
249,Little Collins, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice place. We waited 45 mins to be seated but spent time walking around the place so no issue there. Food was very nice and we enjoyed our spot on terrace under the sun.

253,Little Collins, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Stopped here for lunch after wandering through market. Staff were very polite and friendly. Food was quite interesting, and after lunch I felt not full, but just right as I should feel. Energized for wandering through city for the rest of the day."
254,Little Collins, 4 stars ,6 years ago,The el gringo breakfast is delicious and they serve Lot Sixty One coffee. Great ambience. Service is attentive (a bit too much for my taste) and they are really friendly.
255,Little Collins, 1 star ,2 years ago,The queuing system isn‚Äôt well-administered. There was a lack of communication by staff to those waiting outside. The estimate of time to wait was woefully underestimated (20 mins turning into 40 mins plus another estimate of 20 mins ...). Very poor. A shame as the food looked good!

267,Little Collins, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Food here was so good and I would have given it a 5 star but I think it is a little expensive for what it is and they had run out of dessert however we went in the evening (8:30 pm)..... anyway I will certainly be back... healthy and full of flavour!
