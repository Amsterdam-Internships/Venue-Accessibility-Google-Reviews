0,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Dim sum place for sit in and takeaway food.
In short, 3 Stars for very friendly service, nice presentation, nice sitting area, pricey menu, and decent dumplings/gyoza. ‚Ä¶"
1,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice dumplings place! Good service, great food and great atmosphere : cosy and I appreciate lots of details like the tableware, the presentation on the tray etc. Dumplings tasted really good. I didn't try big plates so I don't know for the quantity in general but that's was enough for me this time!"
2,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I really liked the food here - it is fresh, well done and quite delicious. I find the prices a bit on the high side, and the atmosphere of the place is more like a take out place than a restaurant. The service is really really slow. You can easily wait for more than 30 mins without getting any food or drinks"
3,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Pretty meh. Hipster interpretation of dim sum attempts to add modern twist to traditional Chinese recipes. Looks nice, but you're better off with the real thing."
4,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Dim sum here was not authentic, not fresh and of came in quite small servings - more for a quick meal. The servings are quite small, so we ended up going to another cafe for more food. The dishes came out quick which is probably one of the only good things about the place. The atmosphere was also quite dull and empty."
5,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Highly recommend their bowls. Delicious üòã
6,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best dim Sum in town! Really Nice employees and fast service. It was one of the best restaurant experience I have ever had! The interior was Nice, a cozy place to catch up with your girlfriends. ‚Ä¶"
7,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Staff was friendly, but a bit overwhelmed by our group of six people. My goal here is not to trash the place, but hope that the business takes the reviews and change things. It is true that the portions are small for the price, and the ‚Ä¶"
8,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I come here often, and really enjoy eating here! The staff is one of the friendliest I have experienced in Amsterdam, and are very helpful and forthcoming. Service has become much faster since they gained a new manager. Excellent music too!"
9,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,4 years ago,"To be fair upfront, I did not stay to eat the food.  This review is solely based on my experience when I wanted to order food.  I asked for a number of items across 4 categories and it was explained that I could only order in very specific ‚Ä¶"
10,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I went here a few months ago. Highly disappointing. The variety is dismal for dim sum. If you call something dim sum, I'm expecting more Chinese dishes than anything else. The portions are miniscule for the pricing. When I saw the tiny ‚Ä¶"
11,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"As all reviews, small portion for the price when it comes to dumplings and gyoza. It's a place for snack rather than meal. Some of the choices were better than other as we ordered pork shanghai dumplings, which was good. Pork gy≈çza which ‚Ä¶"
12,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worst restaurant experience I have ever had. The hipster, modern design is ok, but, it‚Äôs supposed to distract you for the worst service ever (rude, teenagers who spent 30min making tea and chatting to other employees about her ‚Ä¶"
13,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Order for two people took over 40 mins to prepare, which made us run late. They were friendly enough to switch it to a take away order but forgot one of the dishes we paid for (which we of course figured out quite late so we couldn't go ‚Ä¶"
14,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Just okay Dim Sum, nothing terribly impressive."
15,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Honestly one of the worst dimsum experience I have ever had. For a hipster restaurant you would expect more innovative dishes, but instead its the same old things but: bland, sad, not fresh and overpriced. whatever you do DO NOT order the ‚Ä¶"
16,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,3 years ago,Only one person working during lunch time. We were told it would take 10 minutes and we ended up waiting half an hour for two meals. I had to change our order from eat in to take out. The seaweed salad container opened and made the bag wet. ‚Ä¶
17,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"I've gone twice and both times I was slightly disappointed; if you're looking for value for money this is NOT the place.  The portions are small, which is fine, but not for 13 euro.  Great place to come and get a snack, don't waste money on the special menu.  Hopefully they will get a vegetarian option for the steam buns in the future."
18,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Dim sum is good quality, just very pricey and very small portions.  Restaurant is very small as well, it looks like it is more geared towards being a take out place.  We needed just a snack, so it sufficed.  Just very pricey."
19,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was okay. Not so special but good filling. Service m√©diocre. The waitress was alone which resulted in a super long wait. After at least 30 min of wait, we asked if we could get a free refill of the icetea (1 glass was included with the ‚Ä¶"
20,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,4 years ago,Repulsive excuse for dim sum. The quality to price ratio is absurd. They give you dumplings of inferior quality (compared to the ones in zeedijk/oriental city). And not only do they serve low quality dumplings they also over steam them and ‚Ä¶
21,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Very disappointed with the price and portions of the meal received. I had a 5 varieties of gyozas which all were lukewarm and only 1 bun to share between two people. ‚Ä¶
22,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Understaffed is the first thing that comes to mind. Cold buns is the 2nd.  Poor service is 3rd. Unwilling to swap one dumpling out of a 5 dumpling sampler because ‚Äùwe are too busy and it would take to long to do that‚Äù one of the 5 dumplings ‚Ä¶
23,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,5 years ago,"The place is boring and standard, no ambiance. The waitress was friendly but it's more like a fast food vibe, since you have to put your own tray away. The Dim Sum we had was ok, but not special or really tasty. Would not recommend this place"
24,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I came here for the first time without having any experience eating Dim Sum, and I can say that it was a really great first experience trying it. The service was good, the dim sum and gyoza/dumplings delicious and tasty and the restaurant ‚Ä¶"
25,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Really small portions for the price... I wouldn‚Äôt consider it a great deal. The veggie gyoza and steamed buns were delicious though - especially with their dim sum sauce.
26,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,3 years ago,"If I could give it zero stars I would... the food was very mediocre, and was not cooked. The dim sum tasted a bit raw, and like it was bought from a Chinese supermarket. Service was so slow as there was only 2 people working... would not recommend at all"
27,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Generally pretty poor to be honest. Gyoza were dry, lacking in flavour and pretty far from good. Rice bowl was actually okay and was a decent portion. Won‚Äôt be rushing back - better places nearby"
28,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"When we went therer the first time, they told us it would be a 25 minute wait, because they were understaffed. So we decided ti come back at another day. When we did, we were the first to order, but it still took 20 minutes for them to ‚Ä¶"
29,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,As far as dim sum goes this place was one of the worst I have had. More fast food type feel then a sit down like it should be. There are better places to get dim sum in town.
30,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Ordered of uber eats. Basically frozen dimsum from the Chinese super market. Can make some myself at home thanks. They even got the chilli sauce wrong...That isn't Chinese chilli sauce and the dimsum sauce tasted weirdly bitter as well. Trust me I'm Asian.
31,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"Not only the place is cold/sweaty. the 5 dim sum per basket are almost dry and low temperature . the worse was the big, hairy, old dog that was walking around all the time while we tried to eat and figure out what kind of place this was ?"
32,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,3 years ago,"They have a 'big meal' option on the menu but it literally has 5 dumplings and one bigger one and a mini salad.. it's super sad and too expensive, you wanna have 6 more meals after."
33,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,4 years ago,"It's all just ok. A limited selection of things and prepared well. Pretty expensive for what you get, so not a good value in my opinion.  It's more of a snack than a real meal.  The second time I went back the food got worse and I was sick the next day."
34,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,3 years ago,Dim Sum Now more like Dim Sum Never! I‚Äôve had better dumplings from Trader Joe‚Äôs and they‚Äôre 20 for $3 USD. The fact the charge $2.5 euro per tiny dumpling is the definition of a joke.
35,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,4 years ago,Overpriced. The staff looks unhappy probably because they know they are robbing customers who walk through their door by serving the smallest portions of oversteamed bland dumplings and overcooked edemame beans that looked yellow and old. :(
36,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place with good food.
They do serve kinda small portions for what they charge for it, so unless you want to spend a lot, just go here for a little bite!"
37,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Overpriced food deprived of actual flavour and tiny portions. Perfect for hipsters who don't have a clue.
Go to Oriental City for real dim sum."
38,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My experience with this restaurant is that I loved that the personnel helped me with my allergies. The food tastes amazing. I‚Äôm reccomend that you go try it out yourself.
Max."
39,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Nothing to do with traditional dim sum. Poor quality, very unclear menu and relative high priced. Trying to ride the 'hip' Pijp trend, but missing any soul"
40,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Really enjoy the atmosphere as well as the great food! Used to order but now go and sit in as it's the complete experience for a quick bite.
41,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,3 years ago,We came out even without trying their food after having unpleasant experience from the staff. Didn't seem that we have various choices of different kinds of dim sums.
42,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Love that this place opened in De Pijp! Really yummy dim sum and the lotus leaf wrap is delivious. We ordered seconds! Staff was really friendly as well.
43,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Really poor price/ quality and quantity ratio. The food is not out of this world and the portions left me quite unsatisfied. I'm really sorry to say this because the staff was nice to me
44,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Too small to eat in cozyly but good is great to order and take home. Nice concept too bad for the place itself and service can take a long time to order and long time to get.
45,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff asked me to rate the place, I guess they were expecting a good review but let's be honest. It's kinda expensive for what you get and super warm inside"
46,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Expensive for very small portions. The food was also a bit tasteless and the meat in the buns was dry. But the vibe was alright.
47,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Very disappointing. Overpriced and not tasty.
No freedom of choice for the dumplings. The wonton soup is small (3), the dough was soggy and the filling not so tasty either."
48,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was good and the staff friendly. But it took forever to get it, dim sum are quite pricey and atmosphere is not so cozy."
49,Dim Sum Now, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"This restaurant serves dimsum and gyoza.
I found the gyoza menu portions to be overpriced for what they bring, but I love the athmosphere and the steamy front-window of this restaurant!"
50,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very understaffed place. Only one young lost guy for the whole place. Food not so good, better than service yes but not good at all."
51,Dim Sum Now, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I had a rice & salad bowl and it was good.
52,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is very good, the place is nice and clean. Portions are a bit small considering the price. The tea is also good."
53,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Small portions, overly priced and there's definitely much nicer dim sum places in town."
54,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Staf is ok, place looks ok. dumplings and gyoza are tasteless. Seem to be coming straight from wholesale and only warmed up and served. Literally a joke."
55,Dim Sum Now, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Nice quality dim sum and very friendly wait staff. A little pricey though for dim sum.
56,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Awesome place! It looks cool, sells yummy dumplings and other dishes and has a cool atmosphere in general üòã"
57,Dim Sum Now, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, but the service was very weird, one of the servers was probably stoned"
58,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great atmosphere and great dumplings as the name outside suggests this really is streaming baskets of joy best food in the dam so far
59,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,3 years ago,Tasteless food - dumplings lacking in flavor. Small portions. Overpriced
60,Dim Sum Now, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice dim sum, but not very much. Ok for the price, I guess. Would have liked an option for 10 dim sums."
61,Dim Sum Now, 1 star ,4 years ago,"45 min to get... 5 poor Dim Sum that was not even tasty... some people at our table even had to leave to not miss their flight, unbelievable!"
62,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great  rice with salmon and lime
63,Dim Sum Now, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Been here several times and always feel pity for the staff who seem overwhelmed. The food is good, though."
64,Dim Sum Now, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The Dim Sum are good but portions are very small considering the price
65,Dim Sum Now, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Slow expensive food. You better eat before you go because you are going to be hungry when you leave.  Maybe a good place to go for apps before you go for dinner.
66,Dim Sum Now, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food was nice but the portions of the meal received was small.
67,Dim Sum Now, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The DimSum are great, but the chicken rice bowl is surprisingly delicious."
