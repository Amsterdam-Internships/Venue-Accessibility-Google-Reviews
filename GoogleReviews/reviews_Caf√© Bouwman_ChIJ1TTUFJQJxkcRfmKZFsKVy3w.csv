2,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 1 star ,5 months ago,"The place looks nice, but if you are not from the neighborhood, expect to be cover excessive prices for a beer, as prices are not listed anywhere."
3,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Cafe Bouwman is traditional bar and cafe located at Utrechtsestraat with indoor and outdoor seating, some with canal views. Opening hours are 9am to 1am daily with extended hours to 3am on Friday and Saturday. â€¦"

9,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Looking for Ajax vs AEK champions league game.  Locals are here. It's a cafe on map but they got more local beer than 3 other bars I visited( who only had Heineken).  9$ Euro for two beers. And prime tv spot for game.
10,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very pleasant, south facing position by a canal. Never seen a  waitress work so hard! My only 'complaint' (and it's no fault of the restaurant but a criticism of The Netherlands) my right to enjoy cigarette smoke free air is completely ignored."

The owner and her colleagues were welcoming, joyful, beautiful, and overall enhanced a true Amsterdam experience for a tourist such as myself. People were great, there was a combination of tourist, locals and some dammn good music. Thank you Cafe Bouwman for a memorable night!"
14,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Waitress was racist toward me. Specifically told me to go away with some choice language.  She behaved in a regular way with the rest of my group who did not have trouble...not just me, also a black guy received similar treatment. Avoid. Very disappointed I was picked on. Do not be anything other than white and go here..."
15,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The worse service I've ever seen. Extremely rude staff. Very basic food - highly unrecommended. Their staff is also very discriminative. They took orders of the Dutch customers outside, however, asked us to come inside to ORDER, to PAY and, â€¦"

19,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Nice location, and a variety of beers... but beware the food. Of the food we tried (burger, Bouwman sandwich, pannini) the chicken pesto pannini was the least bad. The fries were good enough. Service seemed too busy and gruff."

22,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This is pretty much a dive. You'll be far better served by walking to the opposite corner of the canal bridge to Under The Stork (Onder de Ooievaar), which is a solid brown bar. I do not recommend this place for reasons of both environment and clientele."
23,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food portions are far to litle, server from food was very angry and did not even say thank you. Server for drinks was kind but only came twice to our table. Would not come here again."

29,CafâˆšÂ© Bouwman, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Cleanliness and customer service was apparently an unknown concept to the staff. The location is nice, but that's the only thing - given the many nice places in Amsterdam, this is not one I can recommend."
