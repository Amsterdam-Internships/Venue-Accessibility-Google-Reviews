14,Caf√© Bouwman, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Waitress was racist toward me. Specifically told me to go away with some choice language.

22,Caf√© Bouwman, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"This is pretty much a dive. You'll be far better served by walking to the opposite corner of the canal bridge to Under The Stork (Onder de Ooievaar), which is a solid brown bar. I do not recommend this place for reasons of both environment and clientele."
