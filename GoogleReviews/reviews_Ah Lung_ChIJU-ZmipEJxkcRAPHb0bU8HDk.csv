1,Ah Lung, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice small inexpensive local restaurant.  Food was quick and delicious.  Staff are friendly and attentive.  Close to Tram station and from our hotel, Hotel Floris.  Had the wonton soup and curry chicken which was flavorful and exactly what I needed after chilly walk around the city centre."
2,Ah Lung, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It looks a bit ugly or low quality, but the food is so well done. It comes very well spiced and with a good amount in your plate. You don't need to worry about staying hungry after eating there. And the price is good."
