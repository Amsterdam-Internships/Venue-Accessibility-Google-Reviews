0,Shiki, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Absolutely delicious food and super lovely people in the kitchen and service. The food was indescribably delicious, such a good Japanese restaurant we have not yet discovered in Germany. ‚Ä¶"
1,Shiki, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Amazing gem in the center of town. Don't believe the bad reviews, most of them are ancient anyways. Fresh food, very affordable and friendly staff. This place is amazing."
2,Shiki, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"One of the best Ramen I ever ate in Europe.
Good food, nice service, cozy place. Luv it."
3,Shiki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The price of food is quite cheap when compare to other Asian restaurants nearby. It may not be the real Japanese food or very delicious but for me the taste is acceptable and I like it. ‚Ä¶
4,Shiki, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Amazing place...very nice staff, fast and good food!"
5,Shiki, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Best and authentic! Having lived in Japan and other areas of the Pacific Realm, finally we find this little place. Highly recommend!"
6,Shiki, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Small but comfy.
According to my girl, the best soup ever!
Not expensive but delicious."
7,Shiki, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Run from this place if you want to eat good Japanese food and if you are hungry. Gyoza were still quite raw, vegetables were not tasting fresh and the chicken, i did not eat it because i was too scared to be sick. The last thing drinking a can from a straw, never did that in a restaurant yet."
8,Shiki, 5 stars ,a month ago,"For this price, I genuinely think it is such a nice small restaurant! You definitely cannot complain."
9,Shiki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"To a Taiwanese that has lot of experience in Japanese food, I will sincerely recommend this restaurant to any Japanese or Taiwanese that miss your home dish. Because it tastes exactly what I have in Taiwan and Japan! And the service is also nice and quick. Cash only."
10,Shiki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Affordable restaurant, though the service isn't the greatest It does taste a bit bland initially then some Tabasco sauce helped it spice up. Its pretty much handy at times being located in the heart of the city."
11,Shiki, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good ramen and interisting rice tea! My friend had the fried rice , also very delicious. Perfect place if you want to stay in the centrum of Amsterdam but still want some good food and a comfy place to eat"
12,Shiki, 1 star ,4 years ago,"It was terrible. If you can see the image, we left the food after taking a bite from each of our dishes. Ramen sucked and tasted stale. Fried rice was bad with chalky rice and the dim sums were tough as rubber. We had to spit it out and ‚Ä¶"
13,Shiki, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The waitress initially appeared quite uninterested about our order and was more exercised by a random visitor who came in to use their toilet.
When we eventually ordered two noodle soups, we were pleasantly surprised. ‚Ä¶"
14,Shiki, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very good
15,Shiki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic Sushi in the heart of Amsterdam.

This family run business is serious about their great sushi, and I always find myself returning for more."
16,Shiki, 2 stars ,a year ago,Had to pay for small bottled water 2 euros. Sashimi of 18 pieces at 19 euros had small pieces of fish. The ginger was dry and in small pieces (not that easy to cleanse your palace). Gyoza were not very tasty and had no garlic or meat and ‚Ä¶
17,Shiki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,In this small alley is this small japanese restaurant with a few seats inside. Delicious terriyaki.
18,Shiki, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The best ramen I've ever had.
19,Shiki, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Waiting staff shy and not overly friendly/interested. Food was average. Whole place was empty bar one Indian couple, the female chewing with her mouth wide open; given that the place was otherwise silent, this really ruined things for me. ‚Ä¶"
20,Shiki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good food for a good price!
21,Shiki, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Stay away!

This is not a Japanese restaurant and the food being served is far from what you ‚Ä¶"

24,Shiki, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Ramen is great, my thanks to the owner)"
25,Shiki, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"It is a very small restaurant. When you come in the staff is friendly, but there lacks a warm atmosphere. I often eat alone when I have a long, late night at work. Of the two times ate here the place was almost empty and I got a really ‚Ä¶"
26,Shiki, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good japanese food at a decent price. I had the fried noodles with chicken and my wife had the sushi. The only downside is that you cant pay by credit card there so we had to go and withdraw money. Being from Sweden we arent used to this method.
27,Shiki, 1 star ,4 years ago,This is one of the worst so-called Japanese restaurants I've ever been to. The ingredients in the soup were very cheap and lazily prepared. The gyozas had a terrible texture. The rice was just a mediocre plate of sadness. Save your money and don't eat here.
28,Shiki, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went here after a tiring walk exploring De Wallen, and the teriyaki chicken was absolutely amazing. The sauce was perfect and the chicken was cooked amazingly. 11/10"
29,Shiki, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"I came here alone for lunch last week and ordered a pork ramen soup. I was served beef and the soup was disgusting, unable to eat it, and after a debate about the ""mystery meat"" with the rude waitress, I refused to pay full price but ‚Ä¶"
30,Shiki, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Do not reccomend to order any food ,why?

31,Shiki, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Excellent food, great prices!"
32,Shiki, 4 stars ,6 years ago,The service was spot on. The lady was very attentive. The food was amazing. The beer was cold. Food came quickly and was hot and delish. My first japanese food experience and I am not disappointed. Plus it seems to be run by women...yaaayy we women rock.
33,Shiki, 1 star ,8 years ago,"My wife had a craving for some good Japanese noodles, and I wanted some rice and tempura. We were wandering around the city when we stumbled upon Shiki on Zoutsteeg 5, a small ""Japanese"". We thought the food must be good because the place ‚Ä¶"
34,Shiki, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I ordered a udong, but very soon I realized that it was a fake japanese restaurant. It looked like a japanese restaurant, but they had chinese background music and I wondered if they have ever  tried Japanese food. I never ever have seen ‚Ä¶"
35,Shiki, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It was an amazing surprise. We got there with our kids because they were hungry. It's a quiet place,  the service was great and the food too. I strongly recommend to go to this restaurant."
36,Shiki, 1 star ,3 years ago,"First of all: Super unfriendly and rude staff, never experienced something like that in a restaurant before. The quality of food is also very bad. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
