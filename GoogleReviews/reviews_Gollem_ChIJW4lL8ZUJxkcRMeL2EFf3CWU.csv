1,Gollem, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"So many choices and great prices but I'm really giving five stars for Eryc. He was so polite and took his time to make sure we chose a beer that we liked, he was very knowledgeable and was basically keeping the whole place on his own. Very refreshing compared to the awful service we received everywhere else in Amsterdam."
2,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best beer bar I found in Amsterdam. Super knowledgeable staff. Awesome beer from around the world. Reasonable prices. I will be back here the next time I come to Amsterdam. …
3,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Nice place with many’s craft beers.

6,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We like it here every stay we had in Amsterdam we visited this bar. And every time it is a pleasure. Barkeeper is very good and can give you detailed recommendations for fitting beers for you. Next time again :)
7,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing find in Amsterdam. There are so many different craft beers to choose from. Three walls of beers to choose from in fact! Really friendly staff and obviously got to love the Lord Of The Rings references thrown in.
8,Gollem, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,Really nice place to try new tastes of beer. Friendly service
9,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Probably the best place for beer. The bartender is the Wikipedia for craft beers and this place has the largest collection of craft beers in Amsterdam (don't quote me on it). Have to try De moerslutel cyanide cyclops or the lowlander white ale infused. Any attempt to try everything on the menu would probably take 30 days.
10,Gollem, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"30 kind of draught beers, and a very good atmosphere.. not enough for 5 star rating? WIDE selection of beers, very helpful qnd kind service. This place is my favorite so far."

13,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Unbelievable amount of beers available !!!!
They also have cards and few games to play. Definitely a place I recommend !"
14,Gollem, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Beer heaven for craft beer lovers.  Staff was super friendly and very helpful with finding unique beers that I couldn't get in the states.  Beer that I pay $10-15 at home was less than 5 euros.  I would highly recommend this pub.
15,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you're on Amsterdam and you love beer, you MUST visit here. I guarantee you haven't tried all of the hundreds of beers they have! Great beers, great staff, nice bar... Shame it's very hidden! What an Amsterdam beer gem."
16,Gollem, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The finest selection and the most knowledgeable of staff! Ask for a recommendation
17,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place with so many different beers. Especially one of the staff members was really helpful. The place is easy to get to by public transport. Best beer of the night was the IPA (Falco) from the US.
18,Gollem, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, very laid back. It can get very crowded later at night. Great selection of beer, mostly locals go there.. bartender was very helpful and spoke perfect English."

21,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent draft and bottle list. This location leans more to American beer I would say, not surprising considering the neighborhood. Super friendly and knowlwedgeable bartenders."
22,Gollem, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing place with an incredible variety of beer and a really knowledgeable staff. Was in town for 3 days and this was one of the places I visited twice.

Try their Buck beers if they have at that time of the year"
25,Gollem, 1 star ,2 years ago,Latin barman absolutely sad and unprofessional attitude . Altough there are quite a lot different styles of beer. My advice try different bars always part of café gollem. Better and friendly customer service

30,Gollem, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Good spot and good service with a wide variety of tasty craft beers.
31,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This bar offers a forever changing selection of beers. If you're crazy about beer, or if you're interested in tasting different kinds of craft beers, then visit the bar. The bar is small, but it is cosy. Be prepared to pay a bit more for the various beers, as the selection of beers is pretty much only craft beer."
32,Gollem, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing beer selection! Plenty of local ones (breweries from Amsterdam), Dutch beers, Trappist beers, and about the same amount from all over the world. My favorite place to go for a few drinks after a tiring day. It's cosy to sit with …"
33,Gollem, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Very fun bar with an amazing beer selection and wonderful people. My husband and I were visiting on our honeymoon and had been told that this was the bar to go to if you're looking for craft brews. Our bartender was very friendly and …
34,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Wonderful craft beer pub with a huge selection of beers including unique golem beers brewed especially for the cafe. Very helpful waitress who helped my friend find a beer she would enjoy as she isn’t a big beer drinker. Nice place to chill out for an hour or so.
35,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Don’t miss it! Great selection of beers, and nice venue."
36,Gollem, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"So, first of all, the manager was way to drunk. He was a bit persuasive and we felt uncomfortable. Our experience with him would not even get 1/5 stars. But, the other bartenders, Samir and Roel (two guys with beards hahahah) were above expectations, and they handled the situation perfectly. Big love, 10/10."
37,Gollem, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Gollem chain is great - all bars have a wide variety of beers, staff is always there to help with the choice and the atmosphere is awesome. Some places are quite tiny but otherwise it's a great beer pub."
38,Gollem, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"My local pub in Amsterdam. They have a great assortment of beers - from local beers, Belgium, etc. Both indoor and outdoor seating. It is a a bit small and quickly crowded on Friday and weekend, so get there early if you wanna have a seat! The barmen have also good advice for beers and there draft beer change regularly."
39,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is where locals go and it's got good beers on tap.  It's small, like really small but you won't be disappointed if you love a real beer. Conveniently near a tourist area without as much of the influx of tourists."
40,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was our go to beer house while in Amsterdam. We stayed at the Eden Hotel, so the bar was within a two minute walk from the hotel. The bar had an unparalleled selection of beers; there were hundreds of beers available. I did not see …"

42,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Simply an awesome spot with more than a great selection.
Staff is really polite and professional.
Actually ,there's not a single thing i dislike about this place. Could easily recommend Gollem for everyone who enjoys brewery products and a nice relaxed atmosphere."
43,Gollem, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Plus side: lot's of nice beers.
Downside: the bartender knew very little about them, he would not suggest anything exciting when asked nor and the beers from the tap came half foam."
44,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good local IPA, nice service too"
45,Gollem, 5 stars ,5 months ago,27 craft bier. We love it!
46,Gollem, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great selection of beers with A LOT to choose from! A bit slow service and clearing of the tables. Worth a visit if you like craft beer.
47,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great selection of beers! From both the Netherlands and many other places around the globe.
48,Gollem, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my favorite bars in Amsterdam. Small and cosy. Perfect to sit down with a small group of friends and have a beer together. Great selection of beers and friendly bartenders.
49,Gollem, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The amount of beers they serve is insane, the recommendations from the bartender were really good and the prices are fair (cheaper than I expected). If you like special beers, this is the place to be."
50,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great beer bar but no food.  30 taps, a few of their own brewed beers.  Staff and patrons were very nice.  A little outdoor seating on the sidewalk."
51,Gollem, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Good beers, i recommand to check😉"
52,Gollem, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Solid beer bar. Good selection including a few fun/fairly hard to get items. I just got whatever de molen  calls Rasputin now for a decent 6 euro something. Loses a star as you will inevitably have to put up with a group of British tourists …
53,Gollem, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"If your are looking for diversity in types of beer, Gollem it's the place to go. They have around 300 different brands of beer... Go and try it out... If you go there please do me a favor don't ask for Heineken."
54,Gollem, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Easy place to grab a drink. Many beers on tap which didn't disappoint. Bartenders speak multiple languages to make it easy to order.
55,Gollem, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cosy place, perfect to spend 2 jours and chill. They got a wide beer offering, and the music is loud enough to be appreciated but low enough so you have proper conversations! On top of that, the crew is very friendly and always up to share advice!"
56,Gollem, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best bar in town for beer lovers !!!!

61,Gollem, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Great beer bar just outside the Centrum. Beer list is a lot bigger than the location downtown, but it lacks the ""brown cafe"" vibe. Completely feel at home here though!"
62,Gollem, 4 stars ,5 years ago,I always come here when I'm in Amsterdam. A lot of different beers on draft from different breweries in different countries and very friendly staff with great knowledge of the beers. The cafe itself is very cozy.

64,Gollem, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Gollem has 4 cafes in Amsterdam and Amstelstraat has by far the most eclectic selection of beer out them all. It's location means it gets crowded with tourists and thats not always a good thing. Don't be surprised if the guy next to you is …
65,Gollem, 1 star ,2 years ago,Kutservice!  I was looking to try this bar for some time now and finally I did this last Sunday! I was completely disappointed about the service because I've asked for a beer and the bartender poured almost half of if on the counter and …
