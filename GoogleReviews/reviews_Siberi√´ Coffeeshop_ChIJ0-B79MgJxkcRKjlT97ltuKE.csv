I love this place. …"
30,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The best and nicest people. Very accommodating. I had a bad experience in the first cafe and this was the second. I stayed here for a few hours and had to leave for my train and flight home. I highly recommend this place for environment and quality of product :)
31,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely staff, very helpful even when very busy. Great selection of herbs, but what I loved most was that they were vegan friendly with their coffee! Highly recommended."

33,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Found this place on my last trip to Amsterdam  and can honestly say it was one of my favourite coffee shops. Its menu has a good variety of recreational and medicinal products with a good description next to each one. The guy that served me …
34,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good shop, nice weed nice people, there are quite a lot of tourists but it's still chill. Normally they listen to the radio so not really coffeeshop music if you want that, but sometimes the music is quite good"
35,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 1 star ,5 months ago,Count your change in this one. Tried to cheat me out of 5€
36,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"This place is everything a good coffeeshop should be. A beautiful location on one of Amsterdam's prettiest canals. A low key, almost non commercial vibe which contrasts with so many shops these days. An excellent menu, friendly and knowledgeable staff and guess what? The coffee's excellent too. Perfect."
37,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love the chilled environment in here. Its close to the station but somehow seems to evade tourists a but more then other coffee shops in this area and tends to be full of locals. The staff are always very welcoming and happy to chat as well as the customers.
38,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very very nice and comfortable atmosphere! I definitely get the reviews that say it feels more like an actual cafe than a coffeeshop
The food and drinks they offer aren't that diverse but nice"

41,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Don't be fooled by the unassuming entrance. The inside is cozy and quite too busy usually with a good selection. If you're not expert at rolling joints you'll be happy to find that they have a nice selection of 4-5 pure prerolls as opposed to just 1 like most coffeeshops
42,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Friendly welcome, some great advice offered for a non smoker & some tobacco free pre-rolled available.
Nice coffee too with good selection. Steady flow of people but not too busy"
43,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice place to smoke. Staff are nice and friendly. They asked us to come back next time we visited. I love siberie its the sort of coffeshop all smokers should head for when they want a nice chilled time.

46,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely great place! Superfriendly ladies  behind the counter with good knowledge... If you love outdoors that's the place to go!
Strongly recommended for less trippie, and cbd enthusiasts, with low thc strains: West Coast OG & Purple outdoor"
47,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This coffee shop had great vibes and felt like an actual cafe rather than a strip club/hookah bar (like most of the other coffee shops I saw). I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonably priced coffee in addition to other reasonably priced goods :D
48,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very friendly place! Simple and light ambiance! The staff is very kind and helpful and the prices are low. It is in a calm street, so very nice also to read for a moment."
49,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It's a nice and calm place just outside of the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam center. It's a bit small and the weed I got wasn't the best quality (maybe it was because of the strain I picked) …
50,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice coffeeshop, not far away from the train station and not as crowded as many other 'popular' ones. The staff is very helpful and customer friendly. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Amsterdam."

52,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Great selection of weed, and a very clear menu with emoji faces to indicate the effects of each particular type. The price is also good, and they have vaporisers and a chess board. Sometimes they also have a DJ who plays there, although the music is not too loud in consideration of the neighbouring apartments."
53,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,My favourite smoking cafe in this very attractive city.The cafe faces onto a tree lined canal.Great selection of supplies.Very cosy and friendly ambiance.Staff exceedingly helpful and laid back.Good place to relax and read your guide book.

60,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Always worth a visit when you're in Amsterdam. Friendly staff, a great range of teas (that are in jars behind the bar), and the range of smoke on the menu is always extensive."
61,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Good selection, nice smoke... but that is all spoiled by whoever the blonde woman is working behind the counter... she should learn basic customer service (stop being rude to customers who might have a question) and to not get so damn …"
62,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favourite coffeeshop in Amsterdam, very near from central station and located in a nice neighbourhood with local prices and mainly local users, those who work there are very friendly and have 'the' good vibe, pro tip: ask for fresh ginger tea with lemon & honey ;)"
63,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 1 star ,4 years ago,The staff are more inconsistent that the Amsterdam weather. Making people leave 30 minutes before closing so you can sing & shout behind curtains- this and uncertainty as to whether I'm made to feel welcome means even the quality produce is negated.
64,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere, away from the busy central. Tucked away with a great smoking area, a welcome change from the normal square, poorly ventilated rooms of the city centre."
65,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Genuinely read and reviewed before coming here as I only had 5 hours to kill before catching another flight. So after reading many reviews, this place was suppose to ""take better care"" of you from other coffee shops yet the response I …"

83,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice little place, friendly & pleasant staff and a nice selection of products that should cover most desires. A busy trade in people popping in to buy and go as opposed to buying to consume onsite. Take from that what you will."

91,Siberi√´ Coffeeshop, 1 star ,2 years ago,Aggressive rude uneducated bud tenders. Harsh vibes wasn't feeling it. Was much happier at many other spots with 2 blocks.
