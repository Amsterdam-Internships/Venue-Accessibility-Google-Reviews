1,Maximus Pizzeria - Steakhouse, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"pizza was good, chicken was cooked well but i asked for bread in place of fries and they gave me fries anyway, not a huge deal but still. the staff didnâ€™t seem very interested and it took. a while to get their attention to get the bill."
2,Maximus Pizzeria - Steakhouse, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favourite places in Amsterdam! Sure, is in a touristic area, but the food is nice, though I find the place a bit exotic. Is a steakhouse, but they serve Italian food and quite often there are Spanish songs playing ðŸ˜¶
Pizzas and pasta are good and the chef is actually Italian too."

26,Maximus Pizzeria - Steakhouse, 1 star ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Absolutely disappointing! We once had pasta with mushrooms that tasted absolutely nothing. Even the mushrooms, where I wonder how you even get it done. The sauce was more like a soup and didn't stick to the noodles. â€¦"
