0,Frietsteeg, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Pretty much the best fries in Zuid. The lines are usually very long in the evenings but it's worth it. The fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Portions are generous and it's a good value meal. Would recommend visiting if in the neighborhood but as a tourists I would go to Vleminx.
1,Frietsteeg, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Customer cut in line but I still got my order faster, thanks to the employee with curly hair! Great service, killer fries as always. Perfect sauce-to-fry and also onion-to-sauce ratio. They know what good fries are, definitely recommend. …"
2,Frietsteeg, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"The fries are great, but it's really disappointing that some of the staff can be very rude or even aggressive. I can understand that some days are harder than others for the staff, but it's actually always the same two who are rude / unprofessional."

34,Frietsteeg, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Not super-friendly for tourists; one of the workers seemed to enjoy ridiculing anyone who couldn't speak fluent Dutch.
