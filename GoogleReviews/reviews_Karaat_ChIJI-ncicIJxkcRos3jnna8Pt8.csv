0,Karaat, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"Had a dinner on Monday. Seems they specialize in fish/sushi related cuisine, however we opted for beef meat and vegetarian options. Black angus and courgette tempura were well prepared and super tasty. I loved the Mezcal Negroni cocktail. However the attention from staff was poor we had seek for the waitress to ask for things.."

10,Karaat, 3 stars ,2 months ago,Food is good but they seriously have the slowest service in the game. Expect your sandwich to take at least 30min to be prepared in the deli.

16,Karaat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The way food should be. Please don't change this concept and this team. And they make their own pastries including wonderful croissants. Bravo!
17,Karaat, 4 stars ,9 months ago,Really nice addition to the neighbourhood with a nice local Boulangerie in one part and the rest fitted out to a high mixed use level for cocktails and drinks or cosy dining and meeting rooms. Also has a terrace
18,Karaat, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"I love sushi and this one is the best in Amsterdam. If you compare it to other cheaper ones will notice the difference. Fish quality is superb, and so is rice and soya sauce. Worth every money and love their service. Please, keep up great food quality!"

Got some sushi (new entry st the restaurant) take away and it was delicious! ‚Ä¶"
22,Karaat, 2 stars ,7 months ago,Excellent ramen but very shoddy service. Ignored often for an hour and tried to replace wine order when ran out of the ordered wine passing it off as the same. Mixed up orders repeatedly. Disappointed and would only come back for a quick meal without drinks.
23,Karaat, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"A beautiful location  on the water of the Ij accessible  by boat.
There is a hip bar / restaurant with a modern and attractive decor.
There is also a possibility for a private area for events

32,Karaat, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Just had dinner with my wife.... Food was nothing special, quality/price not worthed. Twice they didn't bring the food thatvwas ordered and twice they didn't bring the cutlery.  The starter (Shrimps Dim Sum) was very good."
33,Karaat, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Food is great, but service is terribly slow and on times they just dont seem to care at all. You have to wait for a person to come get your order and then wait again a long time to get your order from another person, from whom you cant ‚Ä¶"

37,Karaat, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Food is great but the service is not so fast. They sometimes get their orders in the wrong order so that you need to wait a long time. Also quite pricy but will defintely come back
38,Karaat, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, lovely place, friendly staff and delicious bread! <3"
39,Karaat, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A nice Asian focused restaurant. They serve a good range of well executed cocktails. The food was excellent and the service was some of the best I have had in Amsterdam. The location is a bit out of the way unless you are in Houthaven, but definitely worth a reasonable detour. Don't miss the dumplings!"
40,Karaat, 5 stars ,11 months ago,"Honestly, if you‚Äôre going to spend the money on sushi, Karaat is your best bet. Definitely pricier than your standard Uber eats sushi fare (let‚Äôs be honest, it scratches an itch but it‚Äôs not great), but definitely worth it when it comes to the quality of the fish and the freshness of those damned fine rolls."

48,Karaat, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really friendly staff. Great food. We shared several appetizers and all were delicious. Summer helped us pick out some baked goods before we left and was very helpful and friendly. The chocolates were out of this world. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre in the area.

65,Karaat, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Great location at the waterside. Food is of quality but seems like the kitchen staff and service is unexperienced an not adequate enough at times to maintain the quality. But they opened up just recently (summer 2019) so give them some time to get the act together.
