0,Grizzl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Quoting my partner: ‚Äúbest burger I‚Äôve had in Holland.‚Äù  Three size option so you can pick the perfect size. ‚ÄúCooked perfectly with great topping options. Everything is fresh and delicious. I would come back to this area just for this ‚Ä¶

2,Grizzl, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"The buttered buns taste great. Good chips too. But burger was just regular, and small for the price. None in my group liked it, unfortunately."
3,Grizzl, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Charming fast food location. Everything in meat or veggie option. ‚ÄúResponsible‚Äù food selection and great menu. Only a few seats available, but cosy. Friendly, English speaking staff. Good choice!"
4,Grizzl, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Usually I don't expect much from a place stuck to a mall. But this one is extremely good. It's well designed, very clean, the staff is genuinely friendly, and their fries, and I tried a lot of fries in Amsterdam, are simply one of the best."
5,Grizzl, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Rather a small burger with many chips. Perhaps a bit pricy for the size
6,Grizzl, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I was really starving from walking around and I stumbled upon Grizzl and I thought, ""I love burgers and fries, anyone can make a simple tasty burger."" I was wrong... The fries were ok; they could have been better but they were overcooked ‚Ä¶"

17,Grizzl, 1 star ,a year ago,"I am sad. One of my favorite places for a burger is no more. My wife and I had stomache problems for the SECOND time in 4 weeks. Happpening once, possible mistake. Apologies accepted. Happening twice, just poor hygiene."
18,Grizzl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great spot for a quick bite. They've got vegetarian options, but also juicy beef burgers. The French fries are out of this world, so good! Good option for Flammkuchen: it comes piping-hot out of the oven and has a traditional cracker-thin crust. Scrumptious!"

27,Grizzl, 3 stars ,a year ago,Food is ok for the price they charge you for it's out of balance. Small portions for premium price. Organizational and delivery are terrible. I have been waiting for fries and a burguer for over an hour.  Not ordering from here ever again

37,Grizzl, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great snackbar as the call it in Holland. Good food and good admosphere in the shop. Bit more expensive than the average but I feel it because of the more expensive ingredients they use. Also a lot of options for vegetarians. Happy to eat there again.
