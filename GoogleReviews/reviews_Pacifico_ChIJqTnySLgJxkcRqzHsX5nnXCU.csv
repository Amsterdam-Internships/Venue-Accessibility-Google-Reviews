0,Pacifico, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place in the middle of Amsterdam. Lots of empty seats. Family service. Excellent meal in the company of 12 people.
1,Pacifico, 3 stars ,4 years ago,The food was nothing to call home about. I had the enchiladas and nachos rancheros on two different visits. The service was excellent.
2,Pacifico, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was really good and tasty (well done steak, ribs, sausage, potato, vegetables) and service was fast and pleasant. Tequila was one of the best I've tried so far. However there were many things that could be improved - almost …"
3,Pacifico, 1 star ,4 years ago,"To be honest, this place was fine at first - good food, the waiter (who I think was the manager) was nice - we all had steaks and mixed grills and it was delicious! The downside was trying to pay: when two of our group had to leave early, …"
4,Pacifico, 1 star ,3 years ago,Steak was extremely small and they charged for watery pepper sauce. The waiter just hovers around you which is very uncomfortable. When we got the bill they had over charged us. Would not recommend.
5,Pacifico, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Meal was good, served fast, but they charged for ketchup and mayonnaise, they just put on table and charged for it, without asking and no-one told us we'll be charged for this,  merely one euro, but not nice. …"
6,Pacifico, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice people and delicious meat. The managers are very polite and understanding. On our next trip we will eat there again:)
7,Pacifico, 1 star ,3 years ago,"DON'T GO HERE!!! A horrible experience, we waited for one hour to be served and the food was horrible, they even served us wrong food than what we ordered. The waiters were always lost and messy, the tables were dirty and with dishes from …"
8,Pacifico, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food is not tasty at all. The fish was not fresh, probably deep frozen, chilli con carne was too spicy and you can barely see beans inside. The wine was ok. After that we had stomach problems."
9,Pacifico, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Lured into the restaurant - unpolite behaviour after we payed
Steak was okay, but service was awful and even annoying sometimes
You need to pay extra for every little garnish …"
10,Pacifico, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Food is a bit greasy and the stakes are raw even if you order medium. Had to wait for 40 minutes for our food and got no apology. Rude service, they also ask you for a tip at the end of your meal and look at you judgmentally if you refuse to pay it."
11,Pacifico, 5 stars ,5 years ago,I really enjoyed this place. I was here in the off season and it wasn't that busy. I stopped in for a few drinks. I spoke with the owner and he was really friendly. I can't say how the food was because I only ordered drinks but the beer was …
12,Pacifico, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Do not EVER go here.
A long time ago this used to be a nice Mexican restaurant. Oh have the times changed. …"
13,Pacifico, 1 star ,3 years ago,Steak was bland and non-seasoned. Food is overpriced. Waiters awkwardly stare at you during the entire duration you are dining. I would not come back here again.
14,Pacifico, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Literally the WORST restaurant that I've never been. I ordered a pizza, wait 45min and finally it was another pizza completly different and disgusting. The owner was rude and never apologized. Racist with my english friend. I spent 2 hours there and I didn't dinner... Trust me, don't go there!"
15,Pacifico, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Wine was ok but everything else was terrible. The salmon was not tasty and definitely frozen. Two of my friends had stomach problems after that.
16,Pacifico, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I asked for well done I got rear medium I didn't have time to get it fixed ... That's why you give a customer what that person asked for.
Food taste less"
17,Pacifico, 2 stars ,4 years ago,Empty. Great service cause we were the only ones there. Food was not great. No salsa for nachos and cheese was hard and baked on.  Missed our app completely.  Would not go back.
18,Pacifico, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"£4.50 for a diet coke, hardly any flavour within the meat in my mixed grill and very poor timing with the food coming out, otherwise ok"
19,Pacifico, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Steak was very good. Not pretty, but really tasty. We felt a bit uncomfortable from beginning but more important, service was really unfair. Not ok."
20,Pacifico, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food took a very long time and it still came out raw, even though I asked medium. On top of all they almost push you to giving them a tip, and don't react very well if you don't."
21,Pacifico, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good meat and side orders. We had to wait a while for the patatas fritas to be served but otherwise the service were ok.
22,Pacifico, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Really awfull. When you pass by this restaurant please run away. Very expensive, waiter is rude and tries to oblige you to pay a tip. Food not so good"
23,Pacifico, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Incompetent service, intrusive behaviour, you need to pay extra for garnish, too expensive, they accidently switched our plates, steaks were satisfying"
24,Pacifico, 1 star ,2 years ago,"DONT go in. Big mistake, average steaks, brought us salad with no topping, we got ripped off paying 18 euro just for the glass of colas (literally glasses filled with cola), they are probably going to close it and they just try to rip off as many clients as possible as an end."
