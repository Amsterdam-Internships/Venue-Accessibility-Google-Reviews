151,The Chicken Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Sorry, but the food was almost horrible. Had the chicken burger with a so called aioli which tasted like cheap margarine. I believe the chicken was not roasted like they say. Burger costs a whooping 11‚Ç¨. Chips are at extra charge. No sauces at all, only ketchup or mayonnaise to choose from. To me, it seems like a tourist rip off."
