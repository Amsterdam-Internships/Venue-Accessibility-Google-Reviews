0,Sing Sing, 3 stars ,8 months ago,A friend just so happen to live near this facility a few years ago.  I did not expect to run across Sing Sing.  I was looking for a historical marker but could not find one...would be a nice addition. The facility was gloomy...very.
1,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great place. 5 star accommodation.  Free room and board.  The night time masseuse was a little rough and handsy lol and the waiters kind of rude and rough . Once you get in your not going to want to leave.  Or be able to leave
2,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Don’t know much about the jail yet I can say this I was at a family cookout for hours on the water front before I realized I was right next to the jail. It’s a sad place yet it doesn’t take away from the beauty of the area and for some odd reason I felt safe

6,Sing Sing, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Very dated rooms,carpet needed replaced,room service was very lacking,walls paper thin-heard screaming all night. To make your stay more enjoyable, be nice to your bunk mate, avoid the yard,and don't eat the beans and weenies."
7,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Scenic views of the Hudson and a great gift shop!
8,Sing Sing, 3 stars ,4 years ago,I gave if three stars for the simple fact that everything in here is way to much and the currency's never this complex is completely different than it is in the city. The showers were somewhat crowded and people were a bit to friendly while …
9,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Saw my mate Kevin while I was there, we had a great time just chilling. The rooms could have been a bit better and the food was average  but it really spoke to me and felt like home. …"
10,Sing Sing, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice amenities and the whirlpool suite has a nice view of a fenced in yard where you can view live action fighting. The food is separated into five portion size containers and makes for a delightful eating experience.
11,Sing Sing, 2 stars ,2 years ago,The perfect way to turn-off from the world. No phones or WiFi - allows to fully unwind. …
12,Sing Sing, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Great ppl and officers were super nice
13,Sing Sing, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Not crazy about this new-fangled ""industrial"" decor. I guess people will go for just about anything. And talk about minimalism! You'd think the view of the water must be spectacular but not one window in my room, I mean really... …"
14,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This amazing airbnb is the best gem of the Hudson Valley.   It's like a cross btwn a meditation retreat and fitness training center but a bit overcroweded due to its popularity.  Rooms are bigger than my NYC apartment. I'm sure I'll be back, most patrons are repeat customers."
15,Sing Sing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Not a bad place to stay. Was under the impression the room had a balcony and was disappointed to find out it didn’t. They don’t change the sheets too often and the staff is a bit unfriendly and not too concerned with guest’s needs. Having said that, it’s free so I can’t complain."
16,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My wife and I had a great time during our stay at Sing Sing. Although we could only see each other a few times and they still use landline phones we really enjoyed the time we could talk. For some strange reason we were not allowed to touch …
17,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Sing sing has always been a joy to go, the rooms are usually always available and the main room is like a party. I came here for my friends 30th birthday and they were very accommodating. If you're going for a good time, come to Sing Sing."
18,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Pretty good, all around nice place to be. The food was great!"
19,Sing Sing, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I'd give it 5 stars, but the dinner menu is really limited. That being said, there is something about this place that just keeps you here...oh yea, it's the bulletproof glass, razor wire, and armed guards."
20,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Although I think prisons are generally for bad people, there are a few innocent people that are locked up. However, there's no way of us knowing the bad from the good. The moral of the story is stay out of trouble. Also, some folks are …"
21,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,10 months ago,A great place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there.
22,Sing Sing, 1 star ,4 years ago,"WHY do prisons INSIST on you getting job training or your GED??? You're a FELON, you'll NEVER get a decent paying job with a felony record-even after 30 years out of prison!! (I speak from experience) Maybe THAT'S why the U.$ has the world's highest recidivism rate!!!!"
23,Sing Sing, 1 star ,4 years ago,"In the processing area, you will see family members shunned away for various attire technicalities. I personally, had to go into a bathroom once and take the stitching out of my shirt with my teeth, because I wasn’t allowed on the visiting …"

25,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place a real microcosm of everything New York represents multiple ethnic and national groups from all walks of life living in close proximity to one another food and rooms are a little on the small side but I ain’t complaining and besides legally speaking the staff aren’t actually required by law to feed us
26,Sing Sing, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic, I could wish for a better holiday. The only thing was that when I was in there, I couldn't leave. But don't stress it, Life moves fast, if you dont stop and look around once in a while you might miss it."

33,Sing Sing, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It’s a nice Singing Correct Faculty, but why does my old chair keep sparking up? Electrical problems, 4/5."
34,Sing Sing, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Complex currency, poor room accommodations, and less than savory dining selections......I think I'll holiday somewhere else."
