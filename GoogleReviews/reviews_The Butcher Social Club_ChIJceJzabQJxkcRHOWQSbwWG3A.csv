0,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice decor, staff is polite and attentive. The boozy milkshake was incredible, the truffle burger was delicious and the crispy chicken was pretty good. Also the prices aren't too high for the wonderful view you get of the ocean."
1,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Loved the place,the service but even more the burgers they make..Tried another restaurant from this chain and even with this one they never miss a spot! The Butcher highly recommend!"

3,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,6 months ago,The food is very delicious and priced fairly for the quality. The drinks were good too! I really enjoyed the atmosphere and it's right next to the ferry for Amsterdam so it's a great location.
4,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"This place is only a stone throw ferry ride from Amsterdam.  Super friendly staffs, great outdoor seating with huge covering in case of bad weather.  Some seatings are communal seatings on picnic tables.  Good spot for people, ferries and ‚Ä¶"
5,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,a month ago,We slept at Sir Adam Hotel and the breakfast included was by The Butcher. Because of corona you are served √† l√° carte. Isn't much variety but you can always refill. Not so good price/ quality ratio. Friendly staff. Forgot to take photos.  Sorry guys

7,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Came here for breakfast. My latte and porridge (oatmeal) with fruit was amazing. The service was also very attentive and friendly. It has an incredible view of Amsterdam Central Station! ‚Ä¶
8,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Perfect burgers, great cocktails, very nice staff and service. No reason not to stop by here."
9,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,The burgers here are great. I had the cowboy burger and it was phenomenal. The views here are outstanding. So much glass and views of the water its great. They also have board games a pool table and a ping pong table for use. The service was just ok though. It wasn't great.
10,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"location nice and good service and also lovely stuff, the burger was so delicious"
11,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Not really impressed. Slightly inconvenient location, so you have to take a ferry. Weird staff. Kindermenu-sized burgers (100-150g of meat? Really?!) for an adult-sized price, 'well done' without questions. A bottle of Affligem Blond costs ‚Ä¶"
12,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,6 months ago,This is one of the best places in Amsterdam to have a nice meal or fresh cocktails. The location is perfect close to the train station. The food was excellent and we decided to visit for one of the night parties. We had so much fun and the ‚Ä¶

15,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Apparently one of AMS's great burger places but honestly wasn't satisfying
Ordered the Butcher with cheese. Just a fancier McDonald's honestly. ‚Ä¶"
16,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice food.  Nachos was tasty. Trendy ambience. we had to wait for some time since it was crowded at that time. Great hangout spot for friends and family. Thumbs up.
17,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great food and cool restaurant. Would definitely recommend testing this restaurant! Staff was also really nice. Would recommend the Big Daddy Burger!!
18,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome place, definetly coming back in the future. The atmosphere just feels so lodern but somehow vintage with the whole butcher stuff. The hamburgers where exquisite, and the beer was also good; make sure you don't miss the fries!. The music was awesome amd the waitresses lovely."
19,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This restaurant is located at a super nice place which has a lot of fun party games you can play with your friends while waiting for food or after you've eaten the amazing burgers that they have accompanied by their super tasty fries. The ‚Ä¶
20,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I enjoyed the ride from downtown to ferry to get to The Butcher. It was close to our hotel. It‚Äôs a unique atmosphere with options to seat on comfy chairs or bar chairs and tables. Truffle burger was delicious and my cowboy wasn‚Äôt bad either. Staff was friendly and smiled. Nice view!!!
21,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"nice atmosphere! Burger weren't bad but not that great too. They should have put more sauce in it. I ordered truffle burger but i couldn't really taste it. But deserve to visit, nice place."
22,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The food, the setting and the staff are perfect. So friendly and helpful.

Then there's the food.. chips here are just the best.. ‚Ä¶"
23,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,6 months ago,Nothing was done with my reservation; we reserved a table outside but we could not sit outside even though we saw people sit outside. There wasnt any space in the restaurant to sit except in these very low seated sofa's with a low table ‚Ä¶
24,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Lively place across the river from Amsterdam central. Plenty of games for the kids. Large opening area with cosy seating place. Open kitchen concept where guest will pick up their food when the buzzer vibrates.
25,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I really thought about this one but two start is all I can give them...

First the good parts: the place looks great. Well thought out mix of concrete ‚Ä¶"
26,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Great work in branding, advertising, etc but the burgers are not good. Its of course better than garbage like febo/macdonalds, but compared to real burger places the butcher is just BAD. Small burger, not that many options, poor bun..."
27,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Cool, club music, delicious burgers, sunshine and nice view. Do I need to say anything more"
28,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice service, dog friendly. But the hot chick burger was not so good, somehow there was water kept dripping, perhaps from the tomato, the break at the bottom was soaked."

30,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Only stopped for drinks but it was a great experience. Service was amazing and the drink was impressive, just do yourself a favor an order also water with it; it is very rich. The food menu look really good, next time I would give it a try."
31,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I loved the burger and the funky atmosphere. The staffs knew how to rock their working hours! Enjoyed to see them getting the best out of their time.
Moreover, as a sweet potato fan, their sweet potato fries were outstanding. ‚Ä¶"
32,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A lovely place to stop for a drink. The premises was clean. There was a stroppy girl working on the ground floor bar last Saturday afternoon. She needs to deal a little better with customer relations. All other staff were outstanding. The outdoor part is lovely from where you can admire the city view.
33,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,6 months ago,I'd Never go back. They put an extra round of shots on our tab and refused take them off. They added beers we didn't have. How does a round of 4 beers end up on our tab with a group of 3 guys? When we arrived we were told we couldnt sit on the terrace in the sun? Why? Then a minute later he changed his mind. Horrible touristy venue
34,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,After the day tour we thought this was a good spot for dinner as it's close to the tour stop. First we weren't sure if we could just sit anywhere but after roaming around we ended up finding a tall table with stools. The atmosphere was busy ‚Ä¶
35,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The Butcher is in the base of the iconic ADAM tower, the former Shell Research headquarter. They serve a pretty decent burger with good fries for a good price. Also a useable venue for corporate events like farewells - in the summer nicely outside with good shade and recently we experienced also quick service."
36,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great place with amazing food and nice atmosphere. Food is always made using fresh ingredients! I recommend this place to anyone who wants something to eat at affordable price!

38,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome place to chillout and hang with friends. Located just across Amsterdam Centraal. Look for A'DAM Tower. There is free boat ride every few minutes.
39,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Like the view from the restaurant! The burgers are tasty. Enjoy the beer and coffee here very much.
40,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I do not recommend the nachos.  As a west coast lady that loves mexican/Texas max food, true disappointment.  Barely any cheese and a nacho needs beans. ‚Ä¶"

43,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great meat items. Huge cod entree. Don't be deceived by the touristy nature or the fact that it caters to the Sir A'dam hotel. This place is good! The bar nextdoor is often quite busy as well. Quick ferry rode from Amsterdam central and near to the tourist ""this is Holland"" experience."
44,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Interesting vibes, friendly service, nice burgers. Much less cowded than THT"
45,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Went to the butcher after reading good reviews and it being next door to the hostel I was staying in. Got the lamb burger, sweet potato fries, and the dark chocolate and rum milkshake. It was incredibly tasty and a good price too! I particularly enjoyed the showing of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" which was being projected."
46,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Ordered many times from the butcher. Every time it‚Äôs something else - either food is cold, or they forget the fries, or the sauce, or the fries are saggy. It‚Äôs very tiring to deal with this and get unpleasantly surprised every time you get ‚Ä¶"
47,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"The food is mediocre, the venue is beautiful. The staff seemed overwhelmed but it was ADE so I have to go back another time to see how it will be."

53,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is okay. Their ‚Ç¨6 milkshakes are severely overpriced for the milk drink that you purchase. Overall it feels like a hotel restaurant, which makes sense since it's below the Sir Adam hotel. Staff is friendly but only English speaking."

60,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,7 months ago,"Half empty terrace and still the waiters managed to be slow. Spent most of the time talking to each other. We waited 45 minutes for the waiter to ""be right back"" to take a food order, as he was ""too busy"" after dropping of two cappuccino's. Ignored for 45 minutes until we left and ate some place else."
61,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious burgers and amazing place to sit outside on the terrace and enjoy the view. I also love the cool interior (and the foosball table ;). However, the waiters seemed a little overwhelmed and disorganized."

68,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Four euros for a small beer? Come on... Also the server asked me to pay as soon as I ordered and then took 8 minutes to get the beer. So yeah, paid a lot for an unfriendly beer. Would not recommend."
69,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Burgers are really good and friendly priced. Nice atmosphere and great view
70,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,First order with Ubereats delivery service took nearly one hour. Food arrived stone cold. look at the cheese... Drinks were missing. Manager Butcher declined any responsibility. Very unprofessional.
71,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Near from ferry station, just 3 min on foot. Their food is not bad (most of menu is hamburger). Its mood is really good like jazz club and there are many things to play."
72,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Burger was pretty amazing, excellent flavours"
73,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Good place to relax and have a drink. Food is very normal. Mostly they serve different types of  hamburgers. Staff is very kind.
74,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Unlike the humble burger joint that the venue in Albert Cuyp is, the Butcher Social club is a place that should not carry the same name, because it cannot live up to it. With overpriced beer and dry burgers, it's a far cry to the standard ‚Ä¶"

85,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Arcade machines, lights that go up and down, and very tasty and well served hamburgers, The Butcher in A‚Äôdam Tower is the option for those who want to explore Noord-Amsterdam.

97,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The food here was fantastic! I got the iconic butcher burger with cheese and a side of fries.  It was only matched by the atmosphere and company.  It was dimly lit which gave a nice environment to have a quite evening with friends.

113,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The butcher is super overrated, probably by people who don't know much about burgers. The brand is good, but the quality not.
I would recommend H.Burger, Lombardos, Thrill grill or Burger bar if you know what you're doing (everything is customizable)."
114,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The gentlemen who seated was very kind and accomadating. The young lady who took our order was very nice and gave great service.

118,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Burger was good, the onion rings not so much. The flavors of the burger were dominated by the patty, the bun was good too.

122,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The place is nice - the music is good, the furniture nice. But the food is the worst.

123,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The atmosphere is amazing, good music, lots of space and nice lights. The cider and the cocktails are really good. However, my friend had some fries and they weren‚Äôt that great. Only went for drinks and we had a table upstairs that had hidden drawers in which we found jenga so the night got even more fun."

134,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Saw a football match here once and totally enjoyed it. Delicious food and chatty staff. Nice customers except for one. Pro tip to the bouncers on shift: don't try to be nice with junkies looking for trouble, once thrown out, you're out for the whole night. It's not totally fair but I'm taking away 1 star for that."

Its relaxed enough for having a good conversation with friends, but at the same time energetic and fun. And of course the Butcher‚Äôs burgers are always there in case you get hungry."
138,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Burgers are okay, but I had better. While the burgers are decently priced, the drinks are pretty expensive, for example 4 euros for a small Heine. The music was pretty loud, which made conversation difficult. The interior is nicely decorated, with quite some game like pinball machines. Good for groups."
139,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing place! Awesome location, great burgers, pleasant environment! The best part of the place is the staff. Especially the girl with the glasses and brown shoulder length hair, I've been served by her several times, always smiling and helpful, only best experiences!"
140,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,11 months ago,Absolutely exceptional food and service. Nice staff food prepared quick. Really tasty i would highly recommend.

143,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Left something off my order, kitchen staff said they'll fix it. Went back again after waiting an excessive amount of time to be told ""that's not our problem it's not on the ticket we're not gonna make"" and how I had to talk to the server ‚Ä¶"
144,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The service was slow. The servers were not friendly. My husband ordered the butcher with cheese and the patty was still raw. I really wanted to try the crispy and salted squid. Unfortunately, it was not  available. It would have helped if ‚Ä¶"
145,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic service and really tasty food. Decently priced and a really nice atmosphere in the evening too. Surprisingly quiet considering it‚Äôs only a quick ferry ride away from the station! Definitely would recommend.
146,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been there just once as I do not live in Amsterdam, but will visit again. They have delicious food. It does not feel like a restaurant. It is cosy, feels like a coffee place where you can have a nice glass of wine or a coffee. Comfy ‚Ä¶"
147,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place to eat when you've just arrived and want to sit in the middle of the city and enjoy. It's self serve, they were very nice and portions are sizeable. I'm a fan of the boozy milkshakes also."
148,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,6 months ago,These burgers are something out of the common in Amsterdam... there is not better Burger restaurant.
149,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A bloody good burger in a very nice atmosphere. You get:

152,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had a slight hangover after being at this place for some time üòÇ The burgers are great, beer is tasty, the Cleaver Club cocktail is a great variation on a classic and the staff are funny people. Generally a good atmosphere. The big screen is huuuuuuge and great for watching the footy."
153,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,6 months ago,"I asked for a burger, they didn‚Äôt bring it to me and they said they didn‚Äôt hear what I ordered."
154,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good place, very good burgers, reasonable prices. It's a Go"
155,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,Wonderful location with higher prices than comparable restaurants in the city. After more than 20 minutes waiting time for a beer and a smoothie which we never saw we left the location. Even a colleague of the waiter seemed not to be really interested in our complaint. Btw: The big table near the flippers is completely shaky.
156,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"When going into the restaurant I had no clue what to do, we didn't know if we sat ourselfs down or was seated down by a member of staff. We stood around for 10 minutes until we decided to just sit our selfs down. Once we sat down there was ‚Ä¶"
157,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great food, good service, nice view , weather permitting. Price wise not bad considering the location. Well worth the visit. Short walk to the ferry."
158,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Unbelievably nice, large and friendly place. I've been here both at lunch and dinner time. The waiters were kind, smiling and friendly and my hamburgers were literally from another planet. I was lucky enough to have my food listening to ‚Ä¶"
159,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Here you can eat the pretty good burgers at a wonderful location, the A‚ÄôDAM tower. Fun fact: on Fridays and Saturdays they‚Äôre open 24 hours! The staff is not so professional & the place around peek hours is not really the cleanest. Still an ok place to eat a burger though :)"
160,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,The BUTCHER is a chain of burger joints spread across Amsterdam and is often compared with Royal Cannibale. I visited The Social Club as it was the one I have not visited yet but has the most space - this is really helpful on beautiful ‚Ä¶
161,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The burger tastes great and the price is good. But they really overcharge the drinks. The place looks really great. Fancy and exclusive. They also offer some entertainment, a ping pong table and other stuff."

163,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very beautiful place and nice menu. Definitely going back
164,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This restaurant was located in my hotel. 1st day I got a burger and was not satisfied but when I tried the food again, i got the wings and the Codfather. That fish is everything.  Very good. The wings are well done just like i like. Next day I got the ribs and spicy chicken salad. OMG very good.  The Codfather is a MUST try."
165,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One of the most social and interesting places I have seen
166,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Great atmosphere and excellent burgers. Too bad a Gin Tonic ‚Äî which you order separately from your food at the bar ‚Äî sets you back more than ‚Ç¨10, while it's essentially just a Bombay with Fevertree. The fries are somewhat undercooked. Really go for the burgers; they're amazing."
167,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Went for a team lunch here(14 people) I booked the table(11th march for 14 people) before going in but it was somehow not in the books. On the brighter side o received a call today (14th march) to confirm my booking I think it was just a ‚Ä¶

169,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The interior is nice, but that's about it. An IPA beer is crazy expensive, about scandivian price range. The service is very slow and had to check up after 30 minutes whether they had the order right. Unfortunately nobody of the service ‚Ä¶"
170,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I used to frequent The Butcher at the Albert Cuyp Markt for about a year and a half. Meanwhile it seems to have gotten very famous. That was clear from how the client√®le changed and the queues got longer. The quality did not seem to hold ‚Ä¶
171,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice and spacious place. Full house when we went there, so we have to bring our food to upstairs. Some games for kids and adults to enjoy. Burgers and fries are very delicious."

174,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Very hectic place to eat or have drinks. It's very busy and the staff is just doing their own thing, filling the bar instead of helping all the waiting costumers. The waiter told us that some dishes were sold out and a different one served ‚Ä¶"
175,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Has a club vibe with a DJ playing house music. Good place to grab a burger and do some beers, wines or cocktails before you tackle the Amsterdam nightlife. The Burgers and fries are all pretty good."
176,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I went there twice : service extremely slow. First we had to wait 30 minutes for someone taking the order (and could leave the restaurant 1:45 after entering it - for 2 people...). The second time, I tried again but I left, no one came to me. If you manage to get the food, it is good."
177,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice view, average food, meh service."
178,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice and open location. Good vibe in the bar. Super live music. Yummy burger. The only improvement point is the service. The waitresses did their very best, but were not very good."
179,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Worth crossing the Ij for. Loads of space and a menu with a good range of food and drinks. I had hotdog which wascfar superior to street food. You place your order with the server and receive a device which lights up when your dishes are ‚Ä¶
180,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Atmosphere was nice, there was a DJ, board games, arcade games. The burger was ok, nothing really special, but I enjoyed the milk shake options. Service was confusing, mixed up a few orders and food took a very long time to arrive. Nice views of the Ij."
181,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This place is pretty cool. Nice vibe. Ideal for meeting friends as there are ample cozy areas. Did not eat but menu looked good.  Great location with great water views
182,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Nice relaxed atmosphere. Many different kinds of seating. Beautiful view on the river IJ and Central Station. Arcade games available. Sometimes live music. And last but not least good burgers!
183,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,8 months ago,super friendly waiters and good service. Food was very good as well
184,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Only had nachos and a coke but it was very nice. The kitchen is open plan and there is happy buzz around it. The staff are young and seem well organised. I will definitely return.
185,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We first tried the Butcher in Magna Plaza and we loved it. Food is quite good and the service was great. We then wanted to try the Butcher social club after going from A‚ÄôDam. Before we went inside the restaurant, we decided to take picture ‚Ä¶"
186,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best burger Ive had in a long time! 100% Aberdeem beef and cooked to perfection, didnt need any additonal sauces to make it enjoyable. Such pleasant staff and plenty of spots to sit and hangout and lots of bar seating as well. Quick free Ferry from the city center and definitely worth the time over!"
187,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"cute bar, ordering took a bit long although there where a lot of people there. enough space to move around and food and drinks where really tasty. would definitely recommend to friends and family and... well everyone :))"
188,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Fries were served cold and the burger was well done (as in not medium). If they served everything hot then the price wouldn't be an issue but now it's just overpriced
189,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,The location is awesome but the service and food are mediocre. We came back several times and there is always an issue with the order and the food arrives lukewarm. The Veggie Delight burger was really dry and tasteless but the sweet potato fries were ok.
190,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Didn't eat there, so can't rate the burgers, the milk shakes were ok ( not amazing, 3 out of 5). We did like how we could just be kids and play with Jenga blocks here though. Nice relaxed spacious. Would recommend"
191,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Food came very quickly and was incredibly tasty. Even though there were only two vegetarian / vegan options, they were delicious. The chocolate cake dessert is to die for."
192,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place, friendly staff, the burger was tasty and delicious. It has a great view. Recommend for a drink, innocent burger and a break."
193,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"The medium cooked burger meat is great, but the rest of the burger is a bit plain. Drinks are quite expensive and fries are soggy. The place's payment system is incredibly clumsy; after being required to give a card as deposit to open a tab ‚Ä¶"

196,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool ambiance, a lot of stuff to do (pingpong, arcade, board games). The seats are super comfortable. Only downside are the expensive drinks and the bathroom which is wonderful but located on the first floor"
197,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really nice burgers. They didn't ask how we wanted the meat,but the taste was really good. The place has a good atmosphere"
198,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I want to give this place a 5/5 on vibe... but the service was a 0/5.  I loved the music, scenery, ambiance... but the service was SOOOO bad. SO bad. ‚Ä¶"
199,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Cool design and awesome view! The Butcher has the best (BIG) burgers (meat, chicken, lamb, spicy, vegan...) and delicious (sweet potato) fries!. It operates kind of like a fastfood restaurant (self pickup) but where you can have also cocktails (Yummy). Great stop if you are going to the ADAM Lookoout or the eye film museum."
200,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"My favorite place for having a burger and chilling on the North Amsterdam. Try the burger ""the daddy"" and ask fries as well, very good. There is a DJ in nights, old fashion arcade games and amazing view."
201,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It's a great space really. Lots of games and other fun things to do inside. Very roomy and has a good view of the IJ. We ordered a slow cooked pork ribs and snietzel. Both were decent, nothing to write home about. If you in the north and wanna chill, go and visit!"
202,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Relaxt spot for a hangout with friends! Food was good, especially the fries! Burger was good compared to the price.
Love the game stuff like pinball and table tennis."
203,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We had a great experience with this place. I am gluten intolerant and there was a proper solution for my situation. Alicia did her best to advice me carefully and made sure everything was ok. She was sensitive to our specific needs and helped us with a lovely energy and smile. Will reccomend others!
204,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food, amazing space, good music and excellent services! Everyone was super nice and kind, got there with a large group (20 so people) but left super satisfied. Totally recommend!"
205,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Fantastic service from start to finish. We were a group of nine and the staff couldn't have been more friendly or efficient. The food was served quickly, very tasty and we had a great table at the window. Will be back!"
206,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,We enjoyed the chicken wings here. You order at the bar and are given a pager to notify you when your food is ready to be picked up at the kitchen window.  The bartender was attentive and friendly.
207,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice burgers, good view, it's a mix of a lobby and restaurant. One of the guys working there (Greek guy) is one of the best and friendliest people I was served by in Amsterdam. Rest can improve."
208,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Awesome drinks, super friendly staff. Thanks for taking care of us Francesco!"
209,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Burgers made by people who mean it. Delicious milkshakes. Friendly service and funky atmosphere. Comfy couches inside, nice view and lovely outdoors seating."
210,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,a year ago,Great environment and nice vibe. Beers options are quitw limited so its more like a cocktail place. Food is simple but good.
211,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Unlikely not the usual butcher standards, burgers were cold and not exactly what we ordered... much better at the 9 streets. The system of paying drinks and food separately is messy it makes you pay twice and drinks are also expensive."
212,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good...Beautiful place beautiful music.
213,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"4 euros for a 25 cL Heineken in Amsterdam haha total rip off! Interior is nice as other say and that‚Äôs about it. Burger nothing special, service is really bad (staff said they were busy so maybe don‚Äôt go on weekend I guess). ‚Ä¶"

215,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Just don't go there on a weekend. Friday-Saturday the place will be crowded, the food will suck and service will be just as bad as in any other A'dam joint. During the week you will be able to enjoy decent quality dish or great starter with a drink with nicely smiling service"
216,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Pro's, relaxed atmosphere good located also for people who don't live in Amsterdam or are tourists, nice food too. ‚Ä¶"

219,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a place with a great atmosphere for friends gatherings with nice sofas, and comfortable tables when using laptops. Amazing view on Amsterdam IJ Canal. It has a huge TV screen for watching sports."
220,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Well done is the standard here. Probably the worst burger ever. Very poor. Tourist trap. In all of Amsterdam you can not find more expensive beer
221,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is a bit pricey maybe, but I had the best burger there. Located right next to A'DAM Lookout, it's a great place to grab a meal before or after going there."
222,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Evelien is the best waitress ever. She knows how many stomachs a cow Has! Why people feel cold when coming out of the water and all other nice to know things ;-) ‚Ä¶
223,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The burger is really delicious. The only thing is that it's usually cold. The prices for burgers are between 10.5 and 12.5 euros without menu.
224,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super nice staff - amazingly scrumptious breakfast - exciting, modern atmosphere, unbeatable view - reasonable prices. Shout out to Eleni and her team for a making it a wonderful stay at the sir Adam."

226,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,Our burgers were completely cold so we returned them only to be served another round of cold burgers ten minutes later. The staff seemed all rather ignorant. But they have a DJ..yay!
227,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Great place to visit! We had a blast !
228,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great vibes. But you never know what to expect there might be an event there that would hijack the whole place and you would have to sit outside . That part I find sad. But if there isn't any special event going on it's one of the best places to hang out
229,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great service, friendly waiters, delicious burgers and, and nice atmosphere! We really enjoyed it :) thanks"
230,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Amazing athmosphere
Amazing food
And amazing service! ‚Ä¶"
231,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cool place to hang out with friends. There are ping pong table, table soccer and board games and photo booth ect, roads of things to play with. Burgers and drinks are very tasty too with reasonable price."
232,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,The burgers are good but the music made it hard to talk to the other people on my table. It's a cool location but not for socially eating burgers
233,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The best hamburger gourmet in a Town
234,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved the chicken wrap, my friends ordered the burgers too and loved it. The sweet potato chips were also really nice, I was glad I tried it"
235,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Decent burgers but their strong suite is the variety of offers. Furthermore they have quite some games (including foosball). Great for social gatherings.
236,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Burgers in Amsterdamüçî
237,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, friendly service. But the place does not look clean, the food is very oily and unhealthy, with strange taste. Recommend for drinking, but not for eating."
238,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very nice, cool place"
239,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Sat outside for ten minutes, went inside to ask whether they took orders outside. The guy said no, that I should order here. While this was happening one of his colleagues went outside and handed out some menus to sitting customers taking orders. Dont like dishonesty, so the 1 star rating is purely based on that."
240,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wow what an athmosphere. Great wide variety of burgers. A pool table, tilt, a table tennis. Makes you feel like you want to live there!"
241,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice atmosphere, nice view and good food."

Ask for Giannis, he will give you the best advice on your burger!"
244,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Modern venue with great atmosphere. The atmosphere changes by night. Drinks are ok. There is a self-service when you want to eat.
245,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Sat at the bar and watched as the bar staff took turns waiting on 3 others and washing dishes for 20 minutes before we finally had to call to them to order a drink. The waitress in the morning for breakfast was wayyyyy better and saved this review.
246,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Not 5 stars because the quality changes so much depending on who is in the kitchen (I guess) so some days you get great burgers while other days just average
247,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent truffle burger, nice views of AMS and the river. Great stop if you're on your way to Eye museum or A'dam lookout."
248,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,5 years ago,No dogs allowed even at the bar. There is nothing written at the entrance but after 5 minutes that we were inside someone of the staff kicked us to despite the dog was behaving perfectly. This place is a scum. In 2017 this should not happen.
249,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice and big burger place just across the water in North. Great views on the city

253,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Amazing culinary experience. A place to visit when you are in Amsterdam
254,The Butcher Social Club, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Veggie burger and raw salad were good. Beef burger was average. Bun was kinda stale and the slice of bacon could not have been any smaller on it.
255,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,5 months ago,Probably the slowest bar I've ever been to
256,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Work dinner, we made a mess. The waiter Daniel was absolutely incredible and the burgers are very tasty.
Had a great nite."
257,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Super nice location, seems more like a lounge though than a restaurant, at least inside. I like it. They also have a few old school games like Flipper or pool. Just two expensive for one round of game :("
258,The Butcher Social Club, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Normally it's a nice place to be and to meet.  This time there was no service,  it's was really loud (this loud that you have to raise your voice to screeming level). And asking for tip is also not too polite...:-("
259,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Looked great when we got in with the big screen and furniture but the beers weren't cold, the food was poor, the service was slow, and it felt soulless. We left half way through the game to find a nicer place."

261,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice burgers in a really cool location right next to the Ij river. Usually has good music, arcade games and good vibes. Highly recommended!"
262,The Butcher Social Club, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"It's only because of the nice view and location that you should come here. The service is not great, the food is okay, the toilets are disgusting."
263,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Served up one of the best burgers I‚Äôve ever had, along with a fantastic view and chatty staff, all at a very reasonable price."

265,The Butcher Social Club, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Most delicious burgers, kindest staff and the best ambiance of Amsterdam! Special shoutout to Andre, as he was tremendously giving to us."
266,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was deliciousness and service is good you order at the bar and collect your own food, the music is very much for fans of pop music though and is a place to listen to music more than talk."
267,The Butcher Social Club, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely location, great style inside! Food was amazing, the only thing that stopped it from being 5 stars was the service. Very slow and uninterested!"
