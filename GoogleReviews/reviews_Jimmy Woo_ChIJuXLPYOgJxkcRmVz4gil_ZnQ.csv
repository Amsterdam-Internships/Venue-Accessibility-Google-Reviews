0,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Quite strange place. As a night club I absolutely didn't like it: music, rude staff, uncozy atmosphere. They also give a fitness classes here, but it looks like just collecting some money instead of providing a proper fitness class. …"
1,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,5 months ago,The worst club I’ve ever been to in all my life. The blonde woman working at the front was the absolute rudest person I have EVER met! She was screaming at me and had a horrible attitude. The other man working at the front was also really …
2,Jimmy Woo, 4 stars ,5 months ago,2 rooms with different music.long qué till you enter.
3,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Worst club I’ve ever been to. The lady at the entrance was extremely rude and disrespectful, the security guard at the entrance was very aggressive towards my friend. The music, and the overall atmosphere was horrible too."
4,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Male bathroom attendants are allowed in female bathrooms and will throw you out if you are ill. You don’t need to be drunk to feel ill but a crowded and hot area with little ventilation will do. They apparently have a no throw up policy …
5,Jimmy Woo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite a small club with a ceiling covered in moving light bulbs. We were on the guest list so had no issues getting into the club. The bar downstairs was a bit busy, the music was nice to dance to but sometimes a bit commercial."
6,Jimmy Woo, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Used to be the best place to go out. The hard door entry policy gave it an extra allure. But like the lights in the ceiling the grew dim. Sound system used to be great but under par engineers don't know how to work it. …
7,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Never go there NEVER!
Staff are so RUDE. they are arrogant, aggressive and violent. They are the worst and terrible staff i have ever seen. I went to this place a week ago to see …"
8,Jimmy Woo, 5 stars ,9 years ago,"This is a very high-end club/bar. 2 storeys, upstairs tables and comfortable couches and a well equipped bar + a small smoking area. Downstairs an admirable dance floor with a ceiling full of light bulbs which create a great atmosphere and …"

10,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,My sister went to Amsterdam alone to see her favorite artist. She was at the front and felt very ill because of the crowd so she went to the toilet and threw up. A MAN went inside and threw her out of the club? She paid a LOT of money to go …
11,Jimmy Woo, 2 stars ,7 years ago,Not really delivering what they promised on the new years eve. If they say deep house music is to be played then expect Hip hop trying to be sold as crack house. Well its not very impressive but i liked the dress code. The environment is congested but a bit different. Actually the rating is not 2 but 1.25.
12,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst club in the world! Ordered my tickets online, but didn't even had a chance to get in, the hostess looked at my Colombian friend, who was stone sober, and instantly said he was too drunk to get in, just because he is dark skinned! I …"
13,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Disaster from start to finish. We spend € 175 pp and we where 9 persons with a total cost of € 1575 for NYE and we got the following:

15,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"This place USED to be amazing. To be avoided nowadays. The styling USED to be fantastic. But now looks really tasteless. Last time I visited this place, they had very uptight and aggressive 'security guards' walking around the club, …"
16,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Would never go back there. Atmosphere was ok; however, they need to improve their bathroom attendants. Male attendant shouldn't be able to unlock a female bathroom stall from the outside. It violates privacy laws. It's just not ok."
17,Jimmy Woo, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"Great club located on the second floor.This club is a bit more upscale than an average club but don't be intimidated - it is still located in the midst of Amsterdam. Great location too, as you can hop around and make it to nearby clubs if …"

20,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"We were in there last night, but everything was dissapointing. First of all the black guy with ""blue eyes"" at the entrance, he asked us a ""tip"" because we were not on the list (clearly a brive). So we paid him the entrance and his extra …"
21,Jimmy Woo, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"Coming from London being used to the Mayfair clubs in London e and my friends were expecting Jimmy Woo's to be a very exclusive top club, but it was very disappointing. The place was quite small and packed, people were dressed very casual, …"
22,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"No wonder why everyone has the same complaints. Even one star for this review is wayyyyyy too much. Toilet worker was super rude, very mean, offensive. if it wasn’t for my sick friend, I’d look for the manager. They need to do something about it."
23,Jimmy Woo, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"Once you do get in, the doorgirl got a masterclass in Berlin for not letting people in :) Once you do get in, you'll find an awesome interior and the wrong crowd. The dancefloor in the basement has really cool lighting, which warms this …"
24,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I do not recommend this place to anyone who would like to enjoy themselves in a good environment. The staff are very rude, ignorant and do not care about their guests. Am very disappointed with the way they respond to people. I will never …"
25,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Very bad service, unfriendly staff, overpriced drinks and It’s pretty ugly inside. Greatest thing of the night is that I went out. It smells also inside."
26,Jimmy Woo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Of all the places in Amsterdam,  THIS IS THE PLACE!  This is where you seriously want to go to have a great time,  beautiful inside and out, nice staff, great drinks and friendly people everywhere, after seeing the Miami night life this beats it, hands down Jimmy's IS THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR A GREAT TIME.."
27,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,4 years ago,Ridiculous level of customer service. Ready to literally kick you out and they could not care less about your needs as customer. Spend my money there.. never again.  Good luck with the rest that do so.

29,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,Terrible service. Rude staff. Unimpressive atmosphere. “Bottle service” is a joke. Double check your bill because they’ll find ways to overcharge you.
30,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The worst I’ve ever seen, they don’t care anything about the ppl, don’t come here! It’s a disaster... wish I never been here, the whole thing is a joke, witnessed ppl got into fights and police not even got into the district"
31,Jimmy Woo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Way to overpriced! It was good on a thursday night, but prices are horrible and the party wasnt that great. wouldnt go there again for 15 Eur entry + super expensive drinks."
32,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,10 years ago,To the silly woman who works the door and doesnt know when someone will spend more than the 5 hookers she let in ahead of me... Learn how to run a line. We dont have a problem. You do.
33,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,4 years ago,Horrible customer service. We wanted to go out to a nice club... The staff was extremely rude to everyone there. I don't understand what their problem was. Would not go back.
34,Jimmy Woo, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice club, went there and it was kinda empty around 11pm...
Maybe it's amsterdam's fault, but the place looks really cool.
nice lighting and sound.
alcohol isn't the cheapest"
35,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Be aware don’t go to this place, horrible experience for NYE. Wish I never went there. A suppose to be a club with a vip area which is not btw and no DJ"
36,Jimmy Woo, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice ceiling, good bass, not expensive drinks, dangerous stairs... but there are better places to dance."
37,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,5 years ago,"They r racist. They let my white friends in but not me. And when my white friends said ""he's with us"" they still did not let me in. Superficial jerks is what they are.. The only part I'm sad about is that I cannot give them zero stars on Google."
38,Jimmy Woo, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"3.6 , not great, not terrible"
39,Jimmy Woo, 1 star ,4 years ago,"We went there to a gay party with a beach dress code party, but they weren't able to choose such a worst place to that: an UPTIGHT and INTOLERANT club where they sent the security guards because they didn't allow us to take our t-shirt off, even the BEACH dress code, the very warm environment and the small size of the place."
40,Jimmy Woo, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool club, nice music and great mojito... A little bit expensive but the rest is ok."
41,Jimmy Woo, 3 stars ,6 years ago,Depending on the party can be a nice club. Mind the door policy tho (guestlist)

44,Jimmy Woo, 2 stars ,9 years ago,Very bad service during the Amsterdam Dance Event 2012. Even with tickets we had to wait at least an hour outside in the waiting chaos.
