2,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The food is pricey especially if you add extras and we wanted an iced chai but they ran out of ice. The acai bowls come served in a coconut bowl (very instagramable). They are elaborately decorated and came out in less than ten minutes. The ‚Ä¶

We took a vanila bowl and everything is so good.
The taste, the service and most of all the plating is amazing.
Highly recommended!"
20,Rainbowl, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"I'm brazilian and this, definitely, is not a√ßa√≠. It's a cream made of banana and something else... But is not a√ßa√≠. I felt nothing of the a√ßa√≠ taste, nothing, my husband also not, not even the texture and color is similar. The taste of a√ßa√≠ is zero. So.. People can like it, it's ok, but please, don't say it's a√ßa√≠, because it's not."
21,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Have now been here 3 times and the place is amazing!! Definitely recommend the Rainbowls and acai bowls. They also have a vegan version of the Dutch biscuits which are delicious. Have so far LOVED every single thing from here. I'm in ‚Ä¶

23,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"These bowls were amazing! They give you a reasonable portion, and the berry a√ßai bowl was one the best i‚Äôve had. Major bonus points for their French Bulldog, Moos, and how photogenic the bowls are."
24,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hands down the best A√ßa√≠ Bowl I‚Äôve ever had- in any country! So fresh and delicious! Not to mention the prettiest one ever haha. Definitely a must!

The bowl was tasty, probably the best I have tried. ‚Ä¶"
26,Rainbowl, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Big and tasty acai bowls, good enough for european mortals, who don‚Äôt know much about the real deal. They don‚Äôt make the fresh juices on the spot which I find a bit sad. When asked about the juice the stuff told it was made 2-3 days agoüò≠. Oh well, 4 stars for the pretty presentation!"

28,Rainbowl, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is ok, but be prepared to wait for an hour. One of the bowls had a hair in it. Very gross, but i guess that is going to happen when the girl preparing it is not wearing a hair tie. Unhygienic and you‚Äôd expect a much better service/taste of the price of ‚Ç¨9,50 for 1 bowl."

33,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love a good breakfast, especially one this pretty. As the cafe is down a back street it was nice and quiet which I loved as Amsterdam cafes do get rather busy. It had a relaxed feel as there were locals working in the cafe who also had ‚Ä¶"
34,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Their bowls are amazing. The location is easy to reach by public transport and the atmosphere is nice. They‚Äôre serving very good bitter strong coffee (personal pref) and they have a wide variety of alternative diary in case you don‚Äôt want normal milk in your coffee.
35,Rainbowl, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We would've loved to try the bowls, but we've never been served. We waited for 15 minutes, but we never even got a ""Hello"". We stood right in front of 4 employees, who were literally doing nothing, just talking to each other, we said ""Good ‚Ä¶"
36,Rainbowl, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"The bowl was all right, but felt too sweet. I'm hoping they are not adding extra sugar. And I definitely did not enjoy the coffee..."
37,Rainbowl, 4 stars ,a year ago,The bowl and the shake was good. The combo deal that Google maps shows does not work.
38,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I went here with friends and really enjoyed it. The Violet bowl looked and tasted great.
39,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Incredible creations! The bowls taste great and look outstanding. The coffees and other hot drinks are also fabulous, well worth the wait at peak time and the extra cost compared to a standard cafe breakfast!"
40,Rainbowl, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place! The bowls look tasty, but I didn‚Äôt got to try it! Waited in the morning half an hour to get somewhere to sit. Because, guess what, there is only one table and some seats at the window. When finally after 40 min of waiting, we ‚Ä¶"
41,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best breakfast I ever had probably!
42,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I came here with my friends instead of eating breakfast at the hotel. The food was outstanding. Super healthy and tasty vegan yogurt and fruit bowls. Amazing raw cakes and perfectly made coffee. The staff were kind and friendly, would come back in a snap."
43,Rainbowl, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very beautiful smoothie bowls made with a lot of love. Therefore, it takes a while until the food is ready to be served. The very delicious selection of coffee, smoothies, juices, and tee will bridge the time until you start eating. I‚Äôd definitely come back during the next stay in Amsterdam!"
44,Rainbowl, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty but oh so slow! I really think they should provide two levels of service: 1) instagram-worthy presentation that takes 30 min to turnaround but you at least you get your pic! and 2) a quick  ""I just want to eat - no pictures will be ‚Ä¶"
45,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Exceptional smoothie bowls, especially when the weather is hot. Situated minutes from the Heineken Brewery, it's a great stop while sight seeing. If cold isn't your thing, they also have coffee with non-dairy options that include oat, almond, soy and coconut milk. It is a must visit vegan stop."
46,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cute place. The bowls are beautifully decorated. The a√ßai bowls tasted delicious. It was my first time eating a√ßai. I'm still not sure how it taste like but it was nicely combined with the toppings. The matcha tea was fine.

50,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly, beautiful concept and healthy&delicious bowls"
51,Rainbowl, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Come here if you have a lot of time on your hands. Like a lot of time. Two of the same bowl, with no one waiting before us, took an hour to make. The bowls looked and tasted good, but the time it took absolutely dampened the experience."
52,Rainbowl, 1 star ,3 years ago,On our way out of Amsterdam we thought we could stop by and grab a quick smoothie bowl before hitting a museum before heading on the train. They told me it would be a bit of a wait which I took to mean 20-30 minutes. It took us a literal ‚Ä¶

54,Rainbowl, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I came to Amsterdam for a weekend away and walked pass what I though was this quaint coffee shop which turned out to be rainbowls. It‚Äôs an absolutely amazing spot for healthy quick bites of really tasty superfoods in one bowl. ‚Ä¶
55,Rainbowl, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really cool idea! Very tasty! I was soooo full! Quite expensive and we had to wait quite a long time. Not a lot of places to sit. For older people it's not the most comfortable place because the chairs and pretty low to the ground.
