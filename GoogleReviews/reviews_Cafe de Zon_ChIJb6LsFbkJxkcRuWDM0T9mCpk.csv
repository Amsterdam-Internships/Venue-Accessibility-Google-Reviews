4,Cafe de Zon, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Great coffee and really charming people!
5,Cafe de Zon, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice little bar close to the red light district. We had a drink here in the day time and it was a good refuge from the more crazy bars with music and live sports running. The man serving was friendly and service was good.

9,Cafe de Zon, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Horrible place. The bartender is extremely arrogant. I asked if they have a menu for snacks. The guy responded ""it's a bar"" as if bars not suppose to serve snacks. No wonder the place was almost completely empty even when there was a world …"
