0,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,a month ago,"One of the best places in Amsterdam to get a craft cocktail. Even though the bar is part of the hotel, you enter the bar from a separate entrance. Every thing at this bar makes sure you are engulfed in this experience, with friendly, ‚Ä¶"
1,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great hotel bar in the city center ! Always coming back for a cocktail or glass of wine. Really nice service, funny and attentive staff.
Will keep coming ! Thank you !"
2,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Everything about the place exceeded my expectation. The ambiance is very cosy, the look and feel is amazing and the service was top class. Our waiter was very attentive, always keen to explain different drinks, their origin and how they are best mixed. Definitely going there again and would recommend the bar to anyone."
3,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 months ago,One of my favourite bars in Amsterdam. The service is amazing - very professional and they know what they are talking about. It‚Äôs part of a hotel in the Center. The bar it self is a hidden secret!
4,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We had the best evening at this fabulous bar! The bartenders were the nicest people, and they were very knowledgeable, which is much appreciated for cocktail lovers. ‚Ä¶"

11,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great bar! Very large selection of wines and spirits. They also have some signature cocktails that looked really good. Would definitely come back!
12,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I had a well spend evening at the Pulitzer's bar! First of all: what a stylish interior! The service is excellent, the bartenders are genuine and it's noticeable that the mixologists have a great passion for their profession. You can really ‚Ä¶"
13,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Friendly service, serious drinks. But does not seem to be a fully-stacked bar. Not all classics are served, e.g., they did not have all the ingredients for a Singapore Sling."
14,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One of the best hotel bars in the world, always a joy to be here. Good cocktails and it‚Äôs just amazing to have a drink and overlook the canals!"
15,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing atmosphere and great service! Cocktails are good and so the food !

17,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome cocktails, nice ambiance, very friendly staff."
18,Pulitzer's Bar, 1 star ,2 years ago,Terrible experience! We were celebrating my friend's promotion and heard good things about this place but we both were very disappointed. The cocktails presentation is very meh. The flavor was OK.
19,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderful place for a drink with nice views out the window,the service can be pretty slow but the staff are very nice."
20,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The place looks very beautiful inside as well as in their closed garden. But coffee? ?? When you pay over 3eur for a coffee(cappuccino or latte) you at least expect it to be prepared by barista and not simply by coffeemachine. Nevertheless the wine was delicious and atmosphere was great üòä
21,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Rather unique place, classy yet cosy place with friendly and fast waiters and exceptional drinks. Best to visit after the sunset to fill the dark and warm atmosphere of the bar."
22,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very nice and attractive place. A New enjoyable discovery. To be visited!
23,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Spent a few hours drinking cocktails here, had a phenomenal whisky sour and would highly recommend the ""countess""!!  Amazing service from our mixologist, he was super attentive and we loved watching him make the drinks! Lovely and warm setting too with great interiors!"

Amazing service from our mixologist, he was super attentive and we loved watching him make the drinks! Lovely and warm setting too with great interiors!"
25,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent cocktails (the best we had in Amsterdam) with a really cool theme.  However, this place was quite understaffed.   The 3 people there were working really hard, but just couldn‚Äôt have possibly kept up with the demand.   If they had 1-2 more people helping out, this place would have been perfect."
26,Pulitzer's Bar, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Drinks are nothing special, but on the pricier side even for cocktail bars. Interior is beautiful but not spectacular. Personnel is wearing masks and gloves, which is great."
27,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Cosy and friendly atmospere. Warm and well decorated place. Frienldly service and nice coctails and drinks.
28,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I chose this bar at random to visit and I was blown away. The service is excellent and the vibe was easy-going. I loved the fact that the bartenders take time to chat with you if you like. This place felt like a respite from the crowded streets of the busiest parts of Amsterdam.
29,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Really like the ambiance, beautiful antique decor with a beautiful canal view backdrop. I love a great cocktail, but have to say I have yet to try one here that I love. I would rather recommend you get a glass of wine, and the cheese plate is the BEST i've ever had."
30,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A Very classic bar, with really nice and very attentive staff. As a regular guest, I always enjoy one of their creative cocktails. It is easy to understand why they got awarded for best bar in the city. Definitly recommend."
31,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice setting, perhaps inside turns to be a bit too dark if outside the Sun is still up.
Service is good, enjoyed the signature cocktails. Other drinks, like wine are ‚Ä¶"
32,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Cocktails are really good but expensive. They bring nice snacks with drinks. Average price for cocktails 15 euro. Beers are more like normal price 6 euro. Nice to try sometimes
33,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,a year ago,Love this bar! Beautiful and relaxed setting. Not cheap but worth it. Cocktails are perfect and such a cozy space!
34,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,So nice to have a city insider to help me find this beautiful gem.
35,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very knowledgeable bartender, who was very patient with me in explaining the best way to appreciate Scotch. Atmosphere was cool and calm. A great place to grab a drink after a long day of work, or in this case traveling. Unwind, grab a drink and have a conversation with a good friend or stranger."
36,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favourite hangouts in Amsterdam. The bar is super gezellig and the cocktails and wine list extensive. Sometimes wish the bar staff would be a bit nicer, can give off some attitude on occasions that dampens the mood. Definite highlight of Amsterdam and worth a visit"
37,Pulitzer's Bar, 1 star ,3 years ago,I recently organized an event with a group of my coworkers and needed to find a local bar for the venue.  I saw the great reviews online and decided to give this place a shot.  I called ahead to make sure they could accommodate our party ‚Ä¶
38,Pulitzer's Bar, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cocktail ideas and ambience, but unfriendly staff and one tasteless cocktail made a very bad impression on our group of 8,and made us leave after one drink. Waiter didn't care about that cocktail, or experience, or about his behavior. ‚Ä¶"
39,Pulitzer's Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Our server was very sweet, but the drinks are just outrageously priced for what you get (in my case a bog standard old fashioned for ‚Ç¨20 :/ ). I appreciate places like this for helping divest the wealthy of their money, but the rest of us who don‚Äôt care about silly excess should probably avoid."
40,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Really nice stuff and good cocktails
41,Pulitzer's Bar, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice bar with Gatsby named drinks. Service is a bit slow and the drinks are a bit pricey for what you get. It's a nice place to meet up with a friend or two and grab a drink before or after dinner. I wouldn't stay for more than one drink though.
42,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The jewel in Amsterdam's crown. Exceptional service. Exceptional ambiance. Oh and INCREDIBLE drinks. It's not cheap but you pay for the entire experience this hotel bar offers you and based off that - well worth the money.
43,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,a year ago,Had lots of fun here with my husband. Drinks were good and the lady that served us was very friendly. We will visit again soon!
44,Pulitzer's Bar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"In a repeat visit, detached impersonal service on a night which wasn‚Äôt all that busy. No one ever really greeted us, no one refilled our waters, no one asked how our drinks were. In a bar like this, that‚Äôs inexcusable. ‚Ä¶"
45,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We stayed in the Pulitzer hotel our first time in Amsterdam last year and I will never stay anywhere else. Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and perfectly curated. Our first night, we went down to the hotel bar and made friends instantly. ‚Ä¶"
46,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I just LOVE the atmosphere, and the prices are not too high"
47,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I love the ambiance of this place. Dark green walls and green velvet furnishings, gorgeous. The cocktail I had was very good; however, the prices are really high, hence the 4 stars. The ambiance *almost* offsets the high price, but not quite."
48,Pulitzer's Bar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very fancy place, even though the atmosphere was casual. The cocktails were very experimemtal. I would have wished they had some more ""classic""/boring cocktails for the less adventurous types"
49,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Perfect, posh place. Great staff. Wonderful drinks."
50,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Inside the stylish Pulitzer hotel lies a timeless cocktail bar.
Renovated along with the entire hotel, it now lives up to its reputation through its classic menu and effortlessly elegant atmosphere. ‚Ä¶"
51,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice cocktail bar under the Pulitzer hotel. All the cocktails are described with a short story, rather then ingredients. So the waiter/waitress will explain your everything in details."
52,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Surely one of the gems in the Amsterdam bar scene crown, this is wonderful final stop of the evening. The inventive list of cocktails is expertly executed and will leave you wanting to sample the lot. The only shame is having to leave the Pulitzer if you‚Äôre not staying the night."
53,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great cocktails but even more important, very good setting and vibe. The seats in front of the window are prime real estate. Its my fav go to cocktail bar with bros and dates"
54,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I work in the industry and usually don't have a very high opinion of hotel bars but this is by far one of the best! The bartenders are very experienced and enjoy what they do which results in mouth-watering cocktails.

65,Pulitzer's Bar, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Whoever created the bar menu should take up another profession. One dimensional and poorly mixed drinks. Rooibos infusion and a peach liqueur over tequila doesn't work. Avoid. Cross the canal and go to the Hoxton, where they know their stuff."
66,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice, classy atmosphere. We tried the Maid, the countess & french 75 - all were delicious!!!!"
67,Pulitzer's Bar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fabulous!! Amazing drinks and the service is on point. Sophisticated yet cosy. Go here, it's everything!"
