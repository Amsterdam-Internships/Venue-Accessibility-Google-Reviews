0,Kagetsu, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"The only dedicated Japanese dining venue within the ""9 Streets"" area, Kagetsu is smaller than the average Japanese restaurant  found in Amsterdam; It is however more cozy and intimate than most. …"
1,Kagetsu, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"Kagetsu is a cosy Japanese restaurant in the heart of west Amsterdam.

The atmosphere is comfortable and quiet, nice seats with street view for the …"
2,Kagetsu, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"A cozy nice little Japanese restaurant, offers variety of Japanese food. Due to Covid, we can only order the take away/delivery. Though the bento boxes are truly amazing, the katsu curry came with the perfect temperature that it did not …"
3,Kagetsu, 4 stars ,a year ago,Atmosphere: 5 stars - cozy and good location on 9 Straatjes. They have some tiny tables on the sidewalk now. …
4,Kagetsu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Salmon Sashimi was much too thick but not bad. The Maki rolls was not strong enough rolled so that they were falling apart before you could eat it. Teriyaki chicken was a bit over cooked Service was not so professional. As a place, nice and cozy"
5,Kagetsu, 2 stars ,8 months ago,Unfortunately the quality of the food has dropped since I last visited this place a few years ago. I could have rolled the sushi better at home - it was falling apart and in mismatched sizes -  and there was a random piece of tomato and …
6,Kagetsu, 3 stars ,8 months ago,"The atmosphere is quite cool and cozy. Overall arrangement of the dishes looked very inauthentic, and the sushi was falling apart. Staff didn't serve us properly."
7,Kagetsu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Very good restaurant. A wonderfull wooden place with soft music.
Agé dashi tofu is excellent.
I have try chief's special salmon teriyaki hummmm. …"
8,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fantastic quality foods and excellent flavours! Very gevellig and great environment
9,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food. One of the best sushi and sashimi I've ever had. Melts in your mouth!!
10,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,A delicious meal and friendly service in English/Japanese. I had the chicken katsu curry and it was very flavourful. I also enjoyed a warm sake which was very reasonably priced. The food may seem a bit expensive but the taste was worth it! Quaint and warm decor all through out- I will definitely be back!
11,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is very good, although the device tends to be quite slow. For more than a couple people I'd recommend to book in advance."
12,Kagetsu, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"So disappointing. This place had been on my list for awhile, and while the service was actually decent (contrary to recent visitors' experience), the food the so sub-par. The quality of the sushi was terrible, especially for the price. I …"
13,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, excellent service, gezellige sfeer. Liked everything about it."
14,Kagetsu, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The sushi rolls were very average in taste. The rice was extremely sticky though, and the rolls didnt hold their shape well...
I expected better quality for these prices."
15,Kagetsu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Restaurant must have had an off night, because it is wonderfully decorated with great reviews.  But the service was tortuously slow (30 minutes before ordering drinks) and we were told that they only sell bottle water and not give tap water.  If the food ever arrives, I hope it is similar to other reviewers experience."
16,Kagetsu, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I’m a regular customer of kagetsu since 2017 but the last time I ordered my Udon soup, it was so terrible new chef, new staff. The Waiter was working with his joggingpants. It’s like they don’t give anything anymore about service and …"
17,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Taste and quality of the food are amazing! The atmosphere is really relaxing and the staff is extremely friendly. A good spot to go to if you want good Japanese food in Amsterdam
18,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great food, with very competitive price. I had a lunch box and it was very good"
19,Kagetsu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"We cannot scientifically demonstrate it, buy we were sick after that. 2 days in bed sick.
But as we cannot proof that with 100% certainty, we can surely say that after we …"
20,Kagetsu, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Not strangers to sushi, we ordered and received our rolls. They're very large but the seaweed was soft? Not sure if kitchen  just had an off day. Service was good."
21,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent service and great sushi. Fresh fish and very nice rice. The service was kind and friendly. We easily ordered much more than was healthy for us.
22,Kagetsu, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The fish for Sashimi as well as on the Nigri was much too thick. The Maki rolls not strong enough rolled so that they fall apart before you could eat it. Service extreeeemly slow and unprofessional. First our drinks got forgotten.  Than we …
23,Kagetsu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We went on a Saturday for a late lunch, and wanted to grab some bento boxes, but since we arrive 10 minutes past 4 pm, they wouldn't serve the bento boxes, which was disappointing, because it made the meal very expensive: 1 soup, 1 noodle …"
24,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This is a very nice Japanese restaurant. Small but they can fit many people in here. We had the Curry menu. Very filling. You won't go away hungry. In the Negenstratjes neighborhood. It's easy to walk by it. So look carefully.
25,Kagetsu, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Terribly slow... and inexperienced service staff. Waited 1 full hour to finally get our starter (Miso soup). Then we were told that chef is new and things take longer. After another 15 minutes we asked if it makes sense to wait, they …"
26,Kagetsu, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Ramen soup was ok, could be more flavourful and it's a bit expensive"
27,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice quiet restaurant with good food! It was perfect for my date with my boyfriend. (And also had quite a few veggie options!)
I lost my phone in the restaurant and the day after I called them, they tried to …"
28,Kagetsu, 1 star ,5 years ago,"As Sushi fans, we ordered two bento's and a Maki roll. The bento's were ok but with Tonkatsu sauce on the dumplings a bit odd... but the Maki, for the price, should have been a great roll. But, it was mostly rice, totally out of proportion. …"
29,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best place for reasonably priced sushi
30,Kagetsu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Good fresh food though service is slow

32,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really cozy and tasty. The fish was fresh and well plated. I d suggest their menu kagetsu with wine pairings.
33,Kagetsu, 1 star ,3 years ago,You need to be extremely Zen when ordering a meal. It takes forever to get your dinner served. It would be nice to let us know the waiting time before we decide to order. Very bad.
34,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,7 years ago,Fantastic food for an affordable price. Service is quick and courteous. Would recommend to anybody who likes Asian cuisine.
35,Kagetsu, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food was good and prices reasonable for Amsterdam but unbelievably disorganised and slow service...  shame really. We weren’t the only table struggling to get served - heard others complaining too.

40,Kagetsu, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Really nice Japanese food at a great price, there are two restaurants in Amsterdam, this is the one that makes sushi, in the other location there are only hot dishes"
41,Kagetsu, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Service subpar; food was cold and had to be sent back to warm up, drinks not served for at least 20 mins (it wasn't busy?), starters arrived before drinks. Food was okay, nothing special"
42,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,6 years ago,Great little place with authentic Japanese kitchen. Just behind the Dam square. It's a fantastic place to end your Amsterdam tour.
43,Kagetsu, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Eaten here a few times, really like it. Only thing I would say is the menu is a little limited. Classics like Black Cod are missing"
