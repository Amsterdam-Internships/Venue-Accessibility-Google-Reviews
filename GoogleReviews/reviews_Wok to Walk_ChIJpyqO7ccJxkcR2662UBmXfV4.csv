1,Wok to Walk, 1 star ,3 months ago,"I believe it is over rated, the food it is not that bad but it is not super good. The reason why I have rated them with one star is the way how staff deal with us in a way it was very rude. I believe there are so many restaurants in Amsterdam worthy to try than this one."
2,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Good food, friendly staff cozy place to eat."
3,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Love wok2walk. Good and quick, never disappoints. Personal recommendation: egg fried rice, shrimp and spice sauce :) ‚Ä¶"
4,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Nice place run by Tibetan people. Food is super good and affordable as well. A bowl of egg noodles cost ¬£4 and two people can eat it. Nice place to go if you are into noodles a d stuff.
5,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Small area with few tables.quick food service with decent price.meal is large. It‚Äôs easy to take away. Lots of people waiting. I tried teriyaki flavor. It‚Äôs quite salty. But all is good and fine. If you are looking for feeding you stomach and spending less money. This place will be your priority in Amsterdam!
6,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This was suggested as a cheap eat close to Amsterdam Centraal. The base is cheap if you don't add toppings or extras. Went for egg noodles with katsu chicken, Seoul sauce and veg. Was absolutely delicious and considering the amount of ‚Ä¶"
7,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Thank you - great to see a gluten free allergen menu (you need to ask in store). Fried rice and rice noodles are gluten free with some sauces.
8,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best wok fried chinese takeout place in Amsterdam in my opinion. We tried the Brown  rice and udon, and both were so good with added pork (char siew), tofu and cabbage. The Shanghai sauce with black bean and soy was yummy. Tokyo sauce, ‚Ä¶"
9,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Freshly made noodle or rice mix in a box, choose your options from a menu and they fry it up fresh for you.Two meals and soft drinks was ‚Ç¨25 euros. Worthwhile visiting if you need something quick or takeaway as seating inside is very limited and not so comfortable."
10,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The udon noodles meal I had was very good. Make sure when you look at ordering vegetables you look at the pre made mixes they have and choose from those. I did not so that and added vegetables individually and the price of my noodles was very high. They charge more when you order it individually, so I suggest getting the pre made mix."
11,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,7 months ago,One of the best noodles I had !
12,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Like the Chipotle of pan-Asian food. The store is really cramped so it‚Äôs a little confusing the first time, but it‚Äôs actually pretty simple and super quick. Really good comfort fast food that you can walk right out with, just grab lots of napkins to insulate the box as it‚Äôs super hot."
13,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I took shrimps, porks, mushrooms with egg noodles and hongkong sauces ( sweet and sour). It costs me 12.7e. It is good, only a lot of fat ( feel like too much oil). Services are very good."
14,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So light nice fresh meal you can enjoy, staff are amazing smiley friendly."

17,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Missus brought one home recently as a surprise as I love w2w! Hot Asia sometimes gives me ""Rim sting"" but will never stop me going back! Can't get enough of the beef with whole wheat noodles & Hot Asia sauce :)"
18,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Busy Chinese fast food. This outlet's egg noodles is too hard, not cook long enough. They made the wrong order for me..."

26,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,4 months ago,I liked the taste here.. Busy street. I recommend it.
27,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The restaurant is quiet good and the food is made really fast standing up to the name as fast food restaurant. The waiters there don't speak English and it's a bit hard to get some additional information across. But overall, it's a really good place to try out some tasty noodles"
28,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I love it! Very delicious! Fast and convenient to eat. You can eat to go or just sit and finish if you have time. My friend and i have made this our comfort food. I look forward to trying other flavors. Very good to recommend

30,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, good value for money. You can choose between rice, noodles or veggies and depending on your wishes you can add egg or meats &fish. As I'm vegetarian I'm really happy with this place as they offer a lot of different vegetarian options and you can have dinner for only 6 euros! I love the rice with mushrooms, so delicious"
31,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Surpassingly good wok served in takeaway boxes. No complaints at all. The service was reasonably fast, the the boxes are packed to the brim with wok. They may look small, but they'll fill your stomach! ‚Ä¶"
32,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,a year ago,Nice tasty noodles. Good prices. Very nice and friendly staff. They took extra care to make sure all ingredients were vegetarian in our food.
33,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Mmmmmm. Fast casual tastes good. A nice location, coupled with lowish prices and just plain delicious food that you can select is great. Outdoor seating is a bit cramped, however, and the drinks selection is a bit limited, but otherwise, this is the type or fast casual restaurants that Paris needs."

35,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely food fast and easy to order
36,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, fast. The seats were nice too. But it was 11 euros for just the food, without drink, which is expensive.
If you need something yummy quick, though, I reccommend Wok To Walk."
37,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good food good service good prices if I could have it for lunch every day I would!!
38,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Cool spot to grab some quick after hours food. Lots of topping choices and it's healthier than most of the vending machine mystery meat late night stuff. You'll have to walk and eat unless you're lucky enough to get one of the few seats but you'll be cramped either way.
39,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Quick to go and convenient to eat but struggled a bit ordering the food as the cashier could barely understand spoken English. Also, I could barely digest the food till the next day even though I had stir-fry veggies. I tend to have ‚Ä¶"
40,Wok to Walk, 1 star ,2 years ago,First time after many visits over the years and I have to say it wasn't great. My food was only luke warm and the pork was not a nice feel in the mouth cold. Maybe I asked for too many fillings but it wasn't cooked long enough

42,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"good food, a little bit salty becuse of soy sauce."
43,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Simple and small place but food is very tasty and fresh. Had noodles and rice everyday we were in Amsterdam. Great value if you want to eat something quickly or sit and have a break.
44,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Delicious!!
45,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely love the options available to eat from, go for hot asian if you dont want to go  too supple and bland. Go for the cashews or chicken, shrimps are ok but just nice to have the veggies too. ‚Ä¶"
46,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was alright and its made in front of you. But!! I chose the veggie base cause it said on the menu that it was without egg, but still they put egg in it! So make sure you ask without egg if you are vegan or just dont want it. (My ‚Ä¶"
47,Wok to Walk, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Not impressive for a Chinese but fair enough in terms of Asian food in Amsterdam. Ordered egg noodles with beef, tofu and coriander sided with black bean sauce. The meat meets the quantity standard. It might be a good place to go after one happy night after"

50,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A good fast food meal makes the small busy place worth enduring.
As with many choose-your-own-ingredients places, the meal will depend on your ability to combine them properly but everything seemed fresh and flavorful."
51,Wok to Walk, 3 stars ,4 years ago,A bit disappointed in our order.  I ordered Beijing sauce but got Teriyaki on my dinner.  Then I ordered pork for my daughters dinner but got Pork and Beef (also charged for the extra protein I didn't order).  This particular location I ‚Ä¶

53,Wok to Walk, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I love wok to walk. but this branch is small, unclean, understaffed and undercooked. got horrible food poisoning, nearly hospitalized. not quite how I wanted to welcome 2020."
54,Wok to Walk, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Wherever you go in a Amsterdam you will find Wok To Walk around. Talking about food, I had delicious egg noodles with garlic sauce. Most of them have very small area for sitting. Otherwise, they are best place to eat specially when you are very hungry."
55,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"This is a chain of eat-in or take-away restaurants throughout Amsterdam. Any time I return here, this is my go-to place to eat. Cheap prices, excellent food and a big portion served to you in a take-away box. You pick the type of noodle and ‚Ä¶"
56,Wok to Walk, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"There are just no words for how fantastic this experience was. We decided to try this restaurant based on all the positive reviews. When we arrived, it was slammed and we almost got turned away, but they went out of their way to find us a ‚Ä¶"
