1,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"I really wanted to go to this bar but as I'm visiting Amsterdam during lockdown, delivery was my only option. Menu is small but I liked the 3 cocktails that I tried (Penicilin, Moscow Mule, Flying Dutchmen). Nice presentation, they send …"
2,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Great service, delicious cocktails, chilled music and fantastic ambience in this small cocktail bar. The entrance is shared with the Supperclub, so don’t make the mistake of queuing with them and instead walk straight on to the cocktail bar entrance."
3,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,3 months ago,A great place to have a drink when visiting Amsterdam. We stop here every time we visit Amsterdam because of Tineke. She is the bartender there. She is great to talk too and get advice for places to go to dinner. They have a great selection of draft beers too.
4,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Phenomenal experience. I booked a class for 4 for a friends 30th birthday and we were blown away by the quality. It was immersive, educational, fun, well-managed and super friendly from the 2 ladies showing us the ropes. Will absolutely be recommending and using some of the tips and tricks we learned in the future. Thanks so much!"
5,The Flying Dachman, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Nice bar, tasty cocktails, welcoming staff.
At the photo two cocktails served at the same time from the same shaker. Feels like fooled 😞"
6,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Very friendly staff and a personal touch. The bar was quite small so I recommend to book in advance. Great place to start your evening with some very tasty and original cocktails.
7,The Flying Dachman, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Lovely place for a great cocktails. Staff was a bit too much and seemed distressed but I was Saturday night. Prices are affordable but the music is… TERRIBLE

9,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great cocktails and service.

The place is beautiful and cozy, I truly recommend."
10,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Went mid week while on holidays with my girlfriend and we were blown away by the cocktails. We liked it so much we went to go back that weekend but the queue was a mile long. We didn't realise how lucky we were to get a seat in there. Highly recommended if you can manage to get in!
11,The Flying Dachman, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"It's really cool for the experience and the drinks are really good. Buts it's very small and not too comfortable. I loved going and would recommend it, but its definitely more for the experience. The entire place had an awesome feel that I've never gotten from a cocktail bar before. Super Unique!"
12,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very knowledgeable service, willing and happy to answer any questions. I learned a lot about cocktails tonight. You can order according to your taste or preferences, they could serve all my vague and interesting requests :)
Great place, if a bit expensive for Amsterdam. I'll definitely visit again."
13,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,7 months ago,This is a wonderful spot!!!! The bartender (I believe her name is Laura) is incredible! She makes AMAZING drinks and is so kind! I believe a gentleman named Robin was working with her who was just as wonderful! This is a must-go spot while …
14,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,a year ago,"My favourite place in Amsterdam, hands down. Wonderful cocktails, extremely nice and knowledgeable staff. Cocktails are well-balanced, complex and depth of flavours is simply mesmerising. Cosy, modern, classic melted into a wonder bar. Go for the experience and definitely steer off the menu at some point ;)"

Very knowledgeable Barkeepers and an awesome and endless set of possible drinks …"
20,The Flying Dachman, 2 stars ,4 months ago,Long wait 20min despite having a reservation. Cocktails were average at best. Place was overcrowded. At the end they ask you to leave after 1h30min. Not worth it there are much better cocktail bars in amsterdam.
21,The Flying Dachman, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Pretty nice little hideaway of a bar in Amsterdam. The concept behind walking before you fly when it comes to the menu is pretty cool. …
22,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I love this bar!!
The fact that it is tiny (can't seat more than 15 people tops) is it's best feature - it gives the bar a relaxed and chilled vibe, with impeccable service and …"
23,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The staff are incredible behind the bar. Very knowledgeable about their drinks and what they have, and also have fun with their work.

30,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small cosy place with great selection of cocktails, extraordinary menu and fast and friendly service. Definitely worth checking out even if you are not a cocktail person: they are so good that you’ll become one."
31,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a cocktail masterclass in thsi iconic building, with one of the most passionate bartenders I've met.

Absolute ace!"
33,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The cocktail bar is super tiny but gorgeous. The furniture and the lighting makes you feel like living in the early 1900..found because Lonely planet included it in the world top 10 cocktails bar and out shows! By accident we discovered  it also shares the entrance with the most in club of Amsterdam so it's the perfect combination!

59,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Excellent drinks and super friendly waiters!
Loved it."
60,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great pit stop for nice cocktails. You wouldn't spend long time here as it's too small & gets crammed quickly so timing is really important. If you want to relax & enjoy it at ease come when it's not busy!
61,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Awesome cocktails. Stunning looking bar.

The Marmalade, Dutchman, and Bramble were our favorite cocktails on the menu but honestly everything was great!"
64,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Without a doubt, one of the best bars I have ever been to. Cecil knew every classic cocktail our group threw at at her. Atmosphere was great. Snacks were flowing. Best bar in Amsterdam"
65,The Flying Dachman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice drinks, very friendly staff, little snacks is a very nice bonus."
66,The Flying Dachman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It takes a certain steely character to set about going to a cocktail bar named after a legendary Dutch ship that is doomed to never find refuge in port and therefore sail the high seas for eternity.  But this is what the resolve of a …

70,The Flying Dachman, 3 stars ,a year ago,I am appalled at the policy of this bar during COVID times. THERE IS A HAPPY 26th BIRTHDAY with at LEAST 10 people HAPPENING WITH MANY GUESTS HUGGING EACH OTHER. This WAS our favorite cocktail bar! And this is not OK.

72,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A very special, romantic and quirky bar. Extremely small - get there early to not be disappointed. You feel like a VIP when there. Drinks are AMAZING. Very expensive but you get what you pay for. Our favourite bar in Amsterdam."

74,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,By far the best cocktail I had in Amsterdam
75,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best bars in town, for sure! It's small so seating is limited and during weekends you have to make your way past the doormen for the Supperclub, with whom FDC shares the entrance. The bar focusses on classic cocktails and with their extensive selection of spirits they will be able to create any of your favourite cocktails."
76,The Flying Dachman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool place. Drinks were nice. It is a small place so it may be crowded at times.

87,The Flying Dachman, 4 stars ,a month ago,Cocktails tend to be more on the acidic side
88,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Ridiculously small but well equipped bar somewhere near the red light district in Amsterdam. If you want to learn walking before leaping into the diverse world of cocktails then this is the best place to do so. At least in Amsterdam.

93,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I think the best place where to get casual drinks. Also, bartenders are keen and professional to make you a cocktail that's not on the menu. Not cheap, not expensive. Just right . Great selection of drinks and spirits."
94,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"You can sit close to the bar, converse with the tenders and try narrowing down what exact kind of cocktail would suit your tastes. Very user-friendly"
95,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The Flying Dutchmen is the newest and most wonderful place in town to enjoy a good cocktail. Two of The Netherlands finest mixologists, Tess & Timo put together a solid team who know their cocktails. Apart from being incredibly …"
96,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great cocktails, reasonable prices, good service"
97,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had a fantastic time at the Flying Dutchman tonight. Sat at the bar and had a terrific time talking with the bartenders. Had two amazing drinks and would have had a third, but boy were they strong (flying before running). Highly recommended!!"
98,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is what you get when Tess Posthumus and Timo Janse decide to open their own cocktailbar. Five stars for the drinks, hospitality and the interior! The bouncers outside belong to a different venue, just tell them you’re there for Flying Dutchmen, and you can skip the row 💪🥂."
99,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,They have incredible non alcoholic cocktails.  Great option for those of us who want to go out have fun in a wealthy way.  Brilliant . Thanks to Secile.  She is great!

106,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great cocktails, awesome atmosphere."
107,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great little bar in Amsterdam. Friendly staff and nice cocktails. Has limited seating so be weary of that.
108,The Flying Dachman, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"An amazing find! The staff really know their stuff, and asides from the available menu (which is brilliant anyway), they had no problem in creating something different! The wall of spirits on show is incredible to look at as well!"
