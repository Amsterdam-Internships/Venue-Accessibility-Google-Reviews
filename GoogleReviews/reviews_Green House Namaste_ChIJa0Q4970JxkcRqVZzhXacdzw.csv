0,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Quiet small but this establishment was one of the best coffeeshops I visited in Amsterdam. VERY friendly staff, nice and chilly music and good herbs. Love it."
1,Green House Namaste, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice place and good ganja. Too bad about the unfriendly staff. After buying a smoke and sitting down we were told that we had to buy a drink to stay inside. Never heard of this, from a coffee shop I want good weed not a sugary drink."
2,Green House Namaste, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Popped in and they had run out of alot but still had something to smoke. Thry also told us the coffee machine was broken too, we wasn't after one anyway. Very small place with high ceilings and clientele. They have like a little snug area in the corner at the back which was nice but could of done with larger seats I'd say."
3,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best caf√© to go , used by mainly locals so cannabis prices are around ‚Ç¨10.00 cheaper than the tourist coffee shops"
4,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Loved this coffeeshop, very nice interior with suitably creative decor and a nice little outdoor seating area where we spent afternoons relaxing in the sun. Excellent selection of strains and nice coffee to boot."
5,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Usually I never give 5 stars, but today I had a faboulus experience in this small Green House in Waterlooplein. They have the real and original Jack Herrer (not easy to find bcz is not a modern hybrid strain), I bought also 1gr of amnesia ‚Ä¶"
6,Green House Namaste, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice little find. Good selection of weed and hash and the coffee is great. Staff also very helpful.
7,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My favourite coffeeshop in Amsterdam. The staff is lovely and the strains are good. Highly recommend for first time visitors.
8,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Outstanding art & eclectic decor - all so much to look at but you don't feel overwhelmed. The staff are SO friendly and attentive. The credit card machine wasn't working and I had to go find an ATM and the server out my order together to be ‚Ä¶
9,Green House Namaste, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great products, nice shop, friendly staff. A perfect place to stop before and after visiting the nearby Waterlooplein Market.   I miss the old feel of the shop before they remodeled. I used to sit at the table by the front window and watch the people going by. The remodel is quite nice though, and still a comfortable space."
10,Green House Namaste, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This was the first place we visited in Amsterdam and it was a good start. We arrived at the end of Kings Day, but the staff were still super friendly and helpful. The decor is really chilled out and we had a great hour or so in there. Nice little place to stop in."
11,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A tidy little shop hiding next to a restaurant. Refurbished since my last visit, the seating area is more sofa and coffee table than chairs with tables. No more sitting at the counter either. The layout is neater, more visibly organised ‚Ä¶"
12,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Extremely Genuine and kind man working here. I asked him to be patient as I did not know what I was doing. He replied that he has all the patience in the world, and this was very true. Very impressed all around"

18,Green House Namaste, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Called in at 10 in the morning, ID'd me as soon as I tried to order a juice and then refused to serve me. I'm 42 with a bald head, think it's safe to say they couldn't be arsed selling me anything, would have been happier if they just said ‚Ä¶"
19,Green House Namaste, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good coffeshop. It was very hot outside, and all the coffe shops was hot too and no a/c. Only in this branch there was a good A/C, Comfortable sofa, And AMAZING strains! I will keep going!!"
20,Green House Namaste, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The menu is standard fare for the Greenhouse franchise, but the people are really nice and there's an interesting water feature at the back. A decent place to stop over after visiting the markets."
21,Green House Namaste, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Happy to take my money for pretty average dope but one of the female workers was not so inviting and sent us on our way. Didn't even have time to sit down which was a shame because it looked like a chill place
