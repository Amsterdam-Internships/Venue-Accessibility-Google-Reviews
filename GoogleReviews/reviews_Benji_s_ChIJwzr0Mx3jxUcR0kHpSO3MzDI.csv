0,Benji's, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Really nice place. Food was surprisingly good and the interior is so homely. Love all the plants in all corners and covering the whole ceiling. Their chai latte was one of the nicest I‚Äôve had in my life- stunning. Staff were bubbly
1,Benji's, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Wow! What a fantastic place for brunch this is! We very much enjoyed the buns which were to die for. Both of them were finger-licking good. When we asked to omit the bacon in one of them, the waitress kindly offered to replace it with an extra egg. Very good service and we‚Äôll definitely be back!"
2,Benji's, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing brunch place. Great creative menu featuring variety of dishes. Something for everyone‚Äôs taste. It‚Äôs one of my favorite places in Amsterdam. Well done guys!

9,Benji's, 2 stars ,3 months ago,"Disappointed. Food service took over 1 hour and 15 minutes to be prepared and served. Brunch was nothing special and flavours were just not there. For such simple fare, I'm not sure why it took sooooo long when the place was not even half ‚Ä¶"
