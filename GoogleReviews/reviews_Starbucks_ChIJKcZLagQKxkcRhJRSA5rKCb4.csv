1,Starbucks, 1 star ,7 months ago,"The coffee here is absolutely terrible. They make the late/cappuccino either with too much water or too much foam, there's barely any milk in there... The staff just doesn't know how to make coffee. ‚Ä¶"
2,Starbucks, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a decent Starbucks, not too busy and service is good. In my case they forgot to make the drinks, but after I pointed it out it was solved very quickly and I got my drinks. ‚Ä¶"

6,Starbucks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,A beautiful Starbucks with kind and friendly staff. It has a toilet you can use for free when ordering a drink. There is no Starbucks WiFi however there is free WiFi from the station itself. Almost all lattes come with beautiful latteart!
7,Starbucks, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"i went here today and i always take a vegan mocha frap with coconutmilk and no whipped cream, but this one was the best i ever had.. i told the employee who made it that it was amazing! ‚Ä¶"
8,Starbucks, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Staff is friendly and all, but there is no wifi, and they don't even have it posted. I didn't find out about it until I had my drink and sat down. At 9.50 for a frapuccino and a water, the least you'd expect is working wifi."
9,Starbucks, 1 star ,7 months ago,"There were 4 people working and i waited 10 minutes for a plain black coffee, i had to leave without the coffee because i had to catch my bus"

11,Starbucks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Just grabbed my blond hazelnut macchiato and what an amazing stuff! Such lovely people we had a small chat and exchanged few smiles.

12,Starbucks, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Just sit for s tasty Iced Choco Caramel ... üòã
13,Starbucks, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service is good but not a lot of comfy seating/areas, like all other Starbucks I've visited in Amsterdam, does not have a baby/kid chair, which they should REALLY change. No person drinks more coffee then moms!"
14,Starbucks, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great service. Friendly staff.
15,Starbucks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I came here to sip a hot chocolate during my long journey from the airport to the hotel where I stayed while it was raining so hard in the evening. The barista was so nice and polite in answering me when I asked her about the way to go to ‚Ä¶
16,Starbucks, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I ordered a drink and when I wanted to pay with my wallet app I didn't work and I couldn't get it working.

18,Starbucks, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Wanting to have coffee in central Amsterdam, I saw Starbucks and was happy to see it. But I was disappointed with the place, its ambience was not great. The place was moderately decorated. Washroom were not maintened properly. ‚Ä¶"
19,Starbucks, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"They always get your name wrong, just use numbers if you can't spell people's names. The coffee is really bad given the price point and is either too hot or too full in your cup, so that when someone just slightly breezes by you on the train station you spill some on your clothes for the day."
20,Starbucks, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Outlet by a busy train station. Friendly, competent staff. Fast moving line and smiles even during the busy morning hours. Coffee 10/10 within Starbucks context, Barista very capable. Given its location, this branch doesnt have the warm ‚Ä¶"

22,Starbucks, 4 stars ,a year ago,Good Starbucks taste! They open late and location is awesome. Always stop by here whenever there is a train to catch.
23,Starbucks, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"No mobile payments and the website hours are wrong !!!!   Dutch Starbucks in general are below grade.  Terrible Wifi, no mobile payments and seating is average or poor.  Looks like whomever runs these in Holland is not very serious about quality and service.  Staff is very friendly."
24,Starbucks, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Freezing! Don't know if it's normal (but the staff's thick sweaters seem to suggest it is) but this Starbucks is so cold! Every customer kept their jackets on the whole time. Also,  it closes at 7pm not 9pm."

26,Starbucks, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Typical Starbucks except my creme brul√© latte tasted like water. Got to the end and it was pure syrup. Gross
27,Starbucks, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Small friendly Starbucks, ideal for a coffee on the go because of its location next to the train station. Usually no wait for ordering a coffee which is ideal when you need to catch a train."
28,Starbucks, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Typical Starbucks located at the Zuid station. But unlike most other Starbucks, this one doesn't have free WiFi."
29,Starbucks, 1 star ,4 years ago,"1 star, because Starbucks is one of the biggest coffee franchises worldwide and can't even successfully provide internet access and toilets for it's customers. This is a train station. All  i want is to recharge my phone and laptop, internet access and a place to sit. Why is that still always such a hassle when traveling in 2017?"
30,Starbucks, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Why coffee beans are always so over burnt? You can see shiny oily beans they use for espresso.
