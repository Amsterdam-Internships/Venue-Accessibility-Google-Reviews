6,Otaru, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great sushi, reasonably priced too. A shame they don't do uni or other less western types, but still great tasting. Their skewers (yakitori ) are delicious also, especially the fresh shitake mushroom -and this is coming from a self confessed meat lover!"

39,Otaru, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cozy and friendly. Great sushi! We loved the scallop flamb√©. It was an easy place to eat with our 3-year-old, and they even insisted on us bringing our stroller inside! It's hard to find a place that satisfies us parents and our kid, too, but this place did."
40,Otaru, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great sushi, fantastic and fast service"
41,Otaru, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good value for money. The sushi is by no means exceptional, it's good though.

48,Otaru, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good food and service was good as well.  It is located right between the Rijksmuseum and the Heineken Experience.  It's fairly easy to spot with it's signage and advertised 50% off rolls.  However, it only applies to basic nigiri and hand ‚Ä¶"
