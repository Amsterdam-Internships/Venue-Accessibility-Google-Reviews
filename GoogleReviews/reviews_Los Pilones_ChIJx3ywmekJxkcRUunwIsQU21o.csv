2,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Tried every Margarita on the menu, and if you have to pick one go with strawberry! Food was incredible too, everything was really delicious, but my absolute favourite was ChoriQuesso! üòçüòç the team was also super friendly and attentive. ‚Ä¶"
3,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Wandering around the centre of Amsterdam on a Saturday night I remembered the great experience had at los Pilones restaurant years ago. Time to go back to see how they have been. It was a great decision as the food and cocktails were great. ‚Ä¶

9,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,a month ago,"Authentic Mexican food!

10,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, very friendly staff, chill atmosphere, good price/quality.

12,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The food and service were great! I just recommend to reserve a table because it is always full! I went twice during my same trip :) real mexican food ! Not Tex-Mex.
13,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"Unfortunately the tables are the smallest I've ever seen in my life, so small that they only fit 1 person and they are so close to each other that you literally share your meal and stories with strangers. Also extremely expensive, you pay ‚Ä¶"
14,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The best Mexican restaurant in The Netherlands. Its totally a gem in Amsterdam. Great ambiance, delicious food and kind service.
Great experience every time I‚Äôm at Los Pilones.
Try the grill tacos Al Pastor or grilled Pulpo!"
15,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,As a Mexican I can honestly tell you this place is delicious. We had the Alambre and Tuna tacos and the enmoladas. YUM!! SO good. I'd recommend to make a reservation before  getting there. We didn't make one and had to wait for a bit. The ‚Ä¶
16,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,5 months ago,"First time we were really impressed. Food is fresh and authentic and of good quality. However the second time, service was unbelievably slow and we were served cold food. Won't go back for a third time."
17,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"I know nothing about Mexican food, but I do know that their food is delicious. Even though the food was a bit too spicy for me, I still enjoyed the rich taste.
The staff was very friendly."
18,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Disappointing. I‚Äôm Mexican and i was so excited to eat here. Dont let their menu on their website and the pictures of the food fool you, the current menu is TINY. They only have 2 types of tacos and 2 types of enchiladas THATS IT. we came ‚Ä¶"
19,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"food was just OK, taste OK amd the amount was OK, prices are a bit high for what u get. But seems that the dishes with beef were pretty good. I ordered the octopus which was not impressive. we came here with colleagues, if it's not a Mexican colleague wanted to try I wouldn't come in. It's good to try once, but just once."
20,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,The food was delicious and authentic! The music was amazing and everyone spoke Spanish ü•∞
21,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best Mexican food I have had since moving to Europe. This is better than most Mexican food on the east coast of the USA. Was very happy with the service, the restaurant ambiance was good for a lunch or drinks later at night. Seemed like ‚Ä¶"
22,Los Pilones, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Worst restaurant, Mexican or not, in Amsterdam. Bad service, overpriced and tasteless food, fishy payment system. Their 8‚Ç¨ margaritas have not a hint of tequila in them, plus they are pineapple flavored. There tacos at 17.50‚Ç¨ per order of ‚Ä¶"
23,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I came here twice within a few months, both times the food was great - you should try the salmon tacos that are quite amazing!

24,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Great spot for Mexican food and drinks with friends! Gets busy, noisy and packed. Call them before to reserve."

26,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Mexican approved! Real Mexican taste and the best Mexican food I‚Äôve tried in Europe. Enchiladas verdes were very delicious and a bit spicy (careful if you don‚Äôt like hot food!). The tacos del Valle were fantastic too, not really a recipe ‚Ä¶"
27,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,"One the best places to enjoy the authentic Mexican food in the Netherlands, for sure. This is not Tex-Mex food, this is the real Mexican flavour. After eating there you will feel energetic and happy, I don't know how to explain it, it is better if you go."
28,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"So far the best Mexican restaurant in Amsterdam. Tortillas have a really nice flavor. Both classic and innovative tacos are amazing. I tried the pulpo option of the menu and I was happily surprised. They have a nice drinks menu, as well as vegetarian options. The atmosphere is great: we had a nice evening with actual Latin music."
29,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve been here since I was only in Amsterdam while I was abroad, but I think about this place a lot. The mango margarita was really perfect and the right amount of alcohol for me (because I don‚Äôt really like the ‚Ä¶"

32,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,8 months ago,"Sadly they only serve tacos now at high prices. The quality of the food is good though and the ambience is nice. I was very dissapointed as they have changed their menu post-covid to only have tacos, which cost ‚Ç¨20. The margaritas used to ‚Ä¶"
33,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Really nice atmosphere, food and cocktails. Love the tomato cocktails"
34,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"The tacos were absolutely amazing! Fresh tortillas and generous fillings. We had the brisket and the al pastor, both were divine. The margaritas were also delicious and were quite large. I will definitely be coming back!"
35,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good Mexican food for Europe standards (I'm Mexican American). Their frozen margaritas are not from a machine, just blended with ice in a blender. Food was great though and I'll def be back."
36,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and cocktails... The place is a bit small so probably it is better to make a reservation... The dishes are a bit price but it's worth..  Music is great and the staff is friendly...
37,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,8 months ago,Best place for Mexican in town! They have a wide variety of Mexican delicacies in meat and vegetarian. Great cocktails and very reasonably priced.
38,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Great food and drinks, although a tad pricey in my opinion.
Nice staff and quick food. A bit weird music at times, but overall good experience."
39,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Really tasty Mexican food! I'll be back many times to try different selections from their menu. They also have their own hot sauce which I quite enjoyed.
40,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great Mexican food, great tast and nice folks . But‚Ä¶ not suitable for a long night in Amsterdam, spent ‚Ç¨30 and felt hungry 3 hours later"
41,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,"The food is amazing, the drinks are amazing and the service is amazing.
The Tacos are delicious and the margaritas pair beautifully.
Great place for lunch as well, whether alone, or in groups. Great tequila ‚Ä¶"
42,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very good option for when you're caving for some Mexican food. Quite authentic kitchen which can bring you to Mexico for a while. Little piece of M√©xico 7.7/10 Qstars #mole #enchiladas #clamato #guajillo #cochinita #beer #nice ‚Ä¶

46,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,6 months ago,I‚Äôve been going here for years - but find I need to make reservations now. Best enchiladas in town. ‚Ä¶
47,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,a year ago,"The place is nice but overpriced in my opinion.
Tacos are 20‚Ç¨, for 4 tortillas. Beef tacos were decent size and tasty, fish was small and dry. Payed 50‚Ç¨ for a couple with beers and left a bit hungry.
Maybe the other dishes are tastier."
48,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"We loved this place, we had an amazing night, food and drinks were really good. The tacos al pastor are you die for !"
49,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very cute place with yummy dishes and a wide variety of mezcal and tequila!
50,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent Mexican restaurant with good traditional dishes and delicious tacos. The drinks are also really good, Michelada is excellent and they have a nice selection of mezcal and tequila. Tacos with Oaxaca cheese and chorizo are awesome. Guacamole is good."
51,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Inside was really cold. Service was slow. Food was medium. It arrived already cold and not as tasty as I thought it would be. Margaritas were delicious though!
52,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Real Mexican food!  Rico!  Great atmosphere and nice people.  Definitely a great place to visit!
53,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Amazing authentic Mexican cuisine. Try the home made salsas. Deserves 6 stars!!
54,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Recommend anyone trying to find really good mexican food come here! I ordered d the Nachos Pilones and added chicken and it was so f**king delicious.
55,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,The restaurant is quite small and cozy but also gets noisy fast unfortunately. The service was good since the girls were very friendly but not particularly attentive. ‚Ä¶
56,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We got the tacos. Quite pricey for 4 tacos but they were good. Nice lemonade. Staff were nice but it was a little bit slow for lunch. I liked their sauces which is their own brand. I would check out the menu and prices before jumping in. They do have a lot of drinks including Margarita's that look tempting.
57,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,a year ago,The menu is not as expansive as I'd like (was in the mood for a burrito) but the food and margaritas were great. I've been before and was happier with the food so that's why it's a four star rating as opposed to the five star rating I was expecting to give.
58,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I‚Äôm from mexico and I can tell you this food is amazing the waitresses are really kind, it‚Äôs not a cheap restaurant but it‚Äôs is 100 worth it."
59,Los Pilones, 1 star ,a year ago,"Nice food but pricey. Mango magherita delicious, strawberry magherita with big ice cubes inside (not drinkable with straw, not mixed long enough... mentioned to the service and received a non alcoholic, not tasty magherita in return).... Years ago this was one of my favorite places, such a pity..."
60,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,"This is the best Mexican food I‚Äôve found worldwide outside of Mexico (and Texas). Ate here twice during our one week stay. Tried 7-8 different dishes and everything was delicious but you can‚Äôt go wrong with their queso,  carnitas tacos, brisket tacos, and enchiladas verdes. The staff is super friendly too!"
61,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,a year ago,"First, the taste is OK. But the prices are too high for what you get. The dishes are quite simple and minimalistic, so I don't see why they are so expensive. Nachos are from the supermarket. ‚Ä¶"
62,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I really enjoyed my dinner at Los Pilones. Very nice Mexican atmosphere. Huge and tasty margaritas and great tacos (even the side of beans and rice is extremely tasty). Guacamole was too plan for me, therefore, 4 stars, however, I am coming again to try other things too!"
63,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Omg. So yummy. Will now be my favourite Mexican restaurant. Friendly staff. Good service
64,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,a year ago,"The food is OK, but portions are small and too expensive for the quality. One of our glasses had a lipstick stain on it (not great, especially in times of covid) and neither the waitress nor the manager offered to replace the drink or take ‚Ä¶"
65,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice food. Very friendly staff. We were happy.
66,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I've gone to Los Pilones several times. As a Californian it's always been difficult to find good tacos abroad, but I've finally found a good place. Los Pilones also has an extensive collection of Mezcal which is incredibly rare in Amsterdam. If you're craving Mexican food, take it from me, this place is a must."
67,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Delicious Mexican food, arguably the Best Mexican place in  Amsterdam. Great service and top quality food. It is highly recommended if you reserve beforehand. The cocktails are also top!!"
68,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great tacos. I'm used to East LA tacos but these tacos come pretty close
Great service and friendly Spanish speaking staff (of course, they speak Dutch and English.)"
69,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great food, just a little bit pricey for what you get. Will definitely return but will have to save it for more special occasions"
70,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent food, amazing service, a must if you visit Amsterdam and want to taste real Mexican food"
71,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice food, liked a lot I had the tortilla soup very creamy ! The service is also nice, it takes time to get your food but at least the wait is worth it"
72,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Definitely the best, true Mexican food you can find in Amsterdam. Their flavors are authentic and all their dishes are delicious: we love the enchiladas and chilaquiles. It's pricey but there just isn't any other place here that does Mexican food better."
73,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,They have very good Mexican food here
74,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Went for lunch, had a dinner at the other location in NieuwMarkt once and it was very packed. Made a reservation and arrived at exactly 12, we were the first ones and were served super fast. Staff is very efficient and nice. Food is a bit ‚Ä¶"
75,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I was introduced by a Mexican friend to this lovely restaurant. It is the perfect Mexican escape! What a treat! Their wonderful staff members are friendly and relaxed while providing excellent service. They serve delicious, authentic and high-quality food, perfect drinks and amazing tequila - really, could not ask for more. Love it!"
76,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The food is soooo tastey. It is so well balanced and the flavours are incredible. It gets super crowded but the waiters are wonderful in helping you out, just get early. I believe that everything here is super good, though it can be a ‚Ä¶"
77,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great Tacos at this place.  I would of gave it a 5 however the price may be a little higher than needed.  Great to sit outside and staff is super friendly!
78,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was just, ok... The service was decent and the food was decent. The place is clean and the ambience is interesting. Nothing really too spectacular overall. Don't get seated near the restrooms though... While spotless in the men's room, ‚Ä¶"
79,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great, authentic mexican food and cocktails."
80,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A Mexican friend of mine told me to go here because they serve good authentic Mexican food. We went here for a late night dinner and experienced a little bit of Mexico in Amsterdam. The food is very tasteful, friendly staff, the interior design looks nice what makes it all together a great place to eat."
81,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Huuuge cocktails that come with a little jug of more cocktail :)
my steak burrito could have been spicier but otherwise was delicious."
82,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I was really surprised. This is a nice restaurant. Do make a reservation if you want to eat here. And for the Dutch people: please do know that they serve real Mexican tacos here. That doesn't mean those hard shelves that we can buy in the shop.
83,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful Mexican Food! We were not disappointed. Great food and we mean Great food. Chorizo and cheese with soft tacos were Fit! The chicken enchiladas in salsa verde were absolutely amazing. The prawns with soft tacos were so so good. Great staff and a good salty margarita to top it off.
84,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The tacos are amazing, but they changed their menu unfortunately...in a negative way. They removed delicious cocktails, the new cocktails werent delicious and too strongly mixed. The description also doesnt reflect the cocktail you've ordered."
85,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice restaurant with Friendly staff.

Margarita cocktail is very nice"
86,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice Margaritas and Mexican food.
87,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The staff was so kind and the atmosphere was alright. The wide variety of choices was very nice. However, for the price, the food was quite small in portion and sadly nothing special, or maybe worse than the Mexicans I've had. But I should admit that my taste for Mexican is spoiled in an American way. :( I will not go back..."
88,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Authentic Mexican restaurant. Very good vibe and food
89,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Place is overpriced for what it is. Portions are small and I wasn't really feeling those Mexican flavours! 18 euro for veggie tacos for one is a bit of a rip off. Also asked for a side of guac (why do they charge for guac!!!) and was ‚Ä¶
90,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice Mexican restaurant in Amsterdam. They offer a delicious variety of dishes. ‚Ä¶
91,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Mexican food is hard to find in Amsterdam, so Los Pilones is a nice find. The vibe inside is comfortable and the menu is limited but interesting and tasty. I wish the portions were bigger, but that might be a personal problem üò∂"
92,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A famous restaurant recommended by my Latino colleagues. Food is good and has variety of choice. Cocktail is also fine but pretty pricy. We used to live in Arizona and had great Mexican food there, so our expectation was a bit too high. Then four stars from us."
93,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,Delicious! Never disappointed here!
94,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,3 years ago,I think I ordered the wrong thing here. The ratings and suggestions for this place were good and we're originally from the west coast in America so wanted some Mexican food but I wasn't that impressed with the food.  I ordered the mole ‚Ä¶
95,Los Pilones, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Thankfull for the non attending staff. The dishes are small, more tapas size. My wife and I wanted to order more, but it was impossible to get the attention of the waitresses. As we waited our stomachs became bloated. A very weird and not good experience."
96,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice Mexican food, great service, interesting decor"
97,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,Best Mexican (real) food in town. Delicious Mexican dishes serve in a nice latin vibe. The margaritas are also great. Excellent service.
98,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"I'm always looking for good Mexican food in the Netherlands, and so far this is as close as I've come. The food was good but the not too memorable. We were given a table in the back next to the kitchen, which was not ideal because of the ‚Ä¶"
99,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,It was very nice weather so we sat outside however the table is not flat and quite small. The food is pretty good but the portion is rather small compared to its price. The service is not so bad but can't say its quite good. If you like to try Mexican food it's one of few options in Amsterdam.
100,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best margaritas in town! Service is good and food is served fast even though the place is always full to the maximum. The owner (Juan) is very friendly and actually remembers you if you have been there. Real Mexican flavor and quality food. Maybe slightly expensive but worth it!
101,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Went to Los Pilones on the New Market Square. Had some cocktails and Mexican food here. Good quality and nice atmosphere. The place isn't that big but that's good, imo. It really has a Mexican chill vibe and the food is served quite quickly. Would recommend it!"
102,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"In love with this mexican restaurant!!! Amazing food and I recommend to try the Margarita cocktail!! üçπ My favorite one , it gets me speechless. Also the staff is very friendly and they always offer something extra like nachos while we wait for the food. I strongly recommend to give a try, no doubt üëçüèΩ"
103,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Average food, place and staff . We decided to have dinner at Los Pilones as they have a good review but we were disappointed . We ordered enchiladas with salsa Verde. Except the salsa sauce (already made ) the plate was plain , the chicken ‚Ä¶"
104,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"I had been to Los Pilones many times in the distant past, about 5 years ago. Back then, it was a great place to go to eat and enjoy authentic Mexican food and great margaritas. ‚Ä¶"
105,Los Pilones, 1 star ,3 years ago,"May be I was expecting way too much after having heard that it is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Amsterdam. After having tried Los Feliz (which was amazing), i had assumed that this will be a lot better. ‚Ä¶"
106,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious mexican food! A bit pricey but worth it
107,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Best Mexican food in Europe so far after nearly 10 years of exploring.  Lived in Los Angeles and have been looking for anything even close to the restaurants there.  This is close.  Excellent food.  Mediocre service.  Just too busy for staff count.
108,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Delicious Mexican food, pretty authentic. A variety of very good tequilas on offer and awesome margaritas. There was a mix up with our reservation and they solved the problem quickly and gave us some free drinks. Overall a great experience! Muchas gracias!"
109,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Lovely people works here and makes delicious foods
110,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Mexican restaurant in Amsterdam, hands down. Love the Nachos and gigantic Margaritas!! Friendly service and cozy vibes are worth an extra star as well. Will be back!"
111,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Completely overrated. Seems Google reviews becomes like Amazon reviews - fake. Menu description is not 100% correct for all meals and food didn't taste fresh, at least in the late evening. Margaritas are nice though."
112,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Amazing food and very good drinks
113,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Had their Acapulco tacos. Delicious, okay sized but pricey. Taco meal costs 18,5 and I think it can be cheaper. Staff is lovely."
114,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Food excellent - very tasty and ample sized portions. Its only a small place and it was very busy - try to avoid the seats near the serving area we were jostled constantly.  Despite this very enjoyable experience.  Note - there are 2 places ‚Ä¶
115,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been to los pilones a few times, but some things have been declining over the years. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place to sit and the food and drinks are fine, but nevertheless it's been going backwards over the years. The ‚Ä¶"
116,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It will not get a Michelin Star but the experience at Los Pilones was very pleasant. The service is fast, efficient and friendly. The food is tasty and well presented, with typically rice and ""frijoles"" as side dishes. ‚Ä¶"
117,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"cocktails are weak and exspensive.. way too watery.. my friend fished 3 hairs out of her veggie enchilada, she got a new plate though.. however, her tortillas were replaced by some that seemed old. the place has a good atmosphere though. ‚Ä¶"
118,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I love the food here. Great options for vegetarians. The place is nice cozy with good ambience. Also when we visited, there was live music, guitar and singing in Spanish. Only downside a bit towards the pricy side. 20 euros per person."
119,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,There are only a few Mexican restaurants in the city and this is the best. The guac is authentic as well as the menu items. Most any kind of authentic food outside of Indonesian and Dutch are hard to come by Amsterdam. The restaurant is cozy and the owner is always around. I stop in for dinner every time I'm in the city.
120,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I brought my east texan husband here and he felt like he was at home. If you want to taste really authentic Mexican food, this is the place to be. Mexican meals, mexican beers (Dos equis) and great Frozen margarita cocktails!"
121,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 months ago,authentic mexican food
122,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Personally, I would have changed a tiny bit on the mole, but that's just a ""regional"" thing. They were definitely awesome, but a bit too expensive for two students travelling, but I had to try since I haven't had any good Mexican food since I have been to Mexico. Overall very happy! The staff was kind and the limonada was perfect!"
123,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good and authentic Mexican Cantina. Food was on point. Margaritas are great too. Enjoyed our evening there!
When you come late it seems to be better to reserve a table."
124,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Nothing Mexican about the food here. Tasted like Mexican food as attempted by Bulgarians who had never been to Mexico. The servers were great, and the margaritas were good though."
125,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"English man in Amsterdam!  üíÇ Mexican at its best! Fully recommended for the choice and the good service. Is this the best Mexican around. Well you will need to visit to find out for yourself. What's not to love, turn up and get bite of this classic recipes."
126,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Giving two stars for the taste of the food. The service was quite poor. They were not busy, yet we sat for quite a long time before someone took our order. The portions were small, especially considering the price of the food. My partner ‚Ä¶"

128,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Coming from south Florida where we can get very good Mexican food I would say this is as good as it gets. Small place but quaint. I would suggest to soft taco tortilla to each taco because by the time your on your 3rd or 4th it gets to soggy and break.
129,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Restaurant has a great vibe but there were very few vegetarian options.
130,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Best Mexican food I've ever had. The place looks amazing as well and the portions are just right. Would recommend to anyone who's looming for a nice, laid back place to eat."
131,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We were there at a Friday evening. Food was nice atmosphere were special with a nice touch of Mexico. Service was friendly. The only things why I give two less stars: ‚Ä¶
132,Los Pilones, 1 star ,5 months ago,Very disappointed with the food. Not at all tasty.
133,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The best approximation to Mexican kitchen I've seen in Amsterdam. I would recomend the margaritas and the tacos dorados. The rest is good, but lately has lower quality .. it might have to do with the continuous rotation of staff."
134,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was fine (period) The service was ridiculous. We were here way too long and did not order much. My husband ordered the queso which was not great, and was not able to flag down a waiter to send it back. So we had to pay for something we didn‚Äôt eat. My suggestion: hire more people if you can‚Äôt handle dinner rush."
135,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Chicken was super tender, made some awesome tacos (the name was Oaxa-something). Margarita was delicious, but don't expect to get drunk easily. Great place for a fun night."
136,Los Pilones, 1 star ,2 years ago,They hardly pay attention to you if there‚Äôs a large party. The queso is falsely advertised. It‚Äôs really queso fundido which is greasy melted cheese rather than a sauce like queso you may be expecting. Waited 20 minutes for a few drinks. ‚Ä¶
137,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,3 years ago,They could have individual tacos so you could try different flavours instead of having to order a lot of the same one. I had two margaritas but they both were very watery and too sweet for my taste.
138,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a good place to improve your Spanish, and eat a nice, spicy taco. The food is good, but nothing spectacular; the service was fast and friendly. Beef tacos with frijoles - recommended. Tuna tacos- very nice as well, despite the coriander!"
139,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great Mexican food with huge Margaritas (don't go here without buying at least one). All Los Pilones have the same atmosphere, can't really recommend one of them. All are good!"
140,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Always good service and good food in a latin atmosphere. This is real mexican food, so forget about burritos or  other US MEX version of mexican food. Real corn tortillas, tequila and picante sauce. Tacos are always a good option, the entree with chorizo and queso also good. Last time my Margarita could have been a bit strongerüòÜüòÜ"
141,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Finally a place in the Netherlands where they actually serve Mexican food. The enchiladas verde were delicious, with a nice spicyness (and not covered in cheese). The place is a bit small and cramped but has a nice atmosphere and a very cool the decor."
142,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite Mexican in Amsterdam by far. Staff makes you feel at home and food is uber delicious!
If you feel like a liquid meal, the cocktails here will definitely transport you ‚Ä¶"
143,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Went with a local. Food was good, so no issues there. Was disappointed in the service. The server correctly assumed the three of us were foreign but did not realize that one of us was a local resident. She asked for a tip at the end of the ‚Ä¶"
144,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A very popular Mexican restaurant in the Leidseplein area of Amsterdam. The service is OK and they speak Spanish (at least) the restaurant seems to be run with Mexican staff and the micheladas are quite nice, also with Mexican beers like ‚Ä¶"
145,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Prices are too high for the amount and taste of food. Disappointing, especially because I remember a few years ago it was much better.  The good atmosphere sadly doesn‚Äôt compensate."
146,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loved the food. A nice change from the Texmex dishes one can find in other places.
I found it a bit pricey, but absolutely worth it.
The tastiest things I have had in a while."
147,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,We went there mainly for the micheladas and were not disappointed. Amazing mix and tasted as good as any we have ever had. Food was very good as well. Odered chicken/chorizo and spicy shrimp tacos which were both very good. The owner (Juan) ‚Ä¶
148,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Very touristic. The food is OK, but the service is a bit less. The waitress could not give recommendations. We had to wait for our dishes very long time, despite that it was not busy. The price - quality range is not so good. For food that quality the prise is somewhat high."
149,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Finding ourselves hungry on a Saturday night with no reservation we popped into Los Pilones. We were greeted by the warm friendly staff who offered us a seat at the bar while we wait a couple minutes for a table to open up. We ordered our ‚Ä¶
150,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Very delicious. Not Europeanized version at all.
151,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place! The food is good but a little spicy even when in the menu doesn't said it. I recommend to try the strawberry margaritas. The place is small so be sure to make reservations.
152,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Real Latin place, delicious food and great cocktails. Good music , very warm. Highly recommended but remember to do a reservation before, because it's a little cozy. The best: the people."
153,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Cosy small restaurant. Make a reservation if you want to eat. You can also hang at the bar for a drink. They have a small menu even something for a vegetarian. Food is excellent, would highly recommend."
154,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"Los Pilones is a restaurant that excels in many aspects, except its food. The atmosphere is great, the place is oozing a nice latin feeling without unnecessary tacky decoration. Another standout are the cocktails they serve. Very nice ‚Ä¶"
155,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Surprised, my daughter who teaches at the University said Dad! It's great place for Margarita's and the food. And guess what she was right, I'll tell you, she should know she Mexicana from SoCal.üá≤üáΩüá∫üá∏"
156,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Best Mexican food I've had in the Netherlands!
157,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I love spicy food. However the tinga dish was too much for me. I didn't enjoy it. In the other hand, the enchiladas de mole were good and the pastel de elote delicious. Definitely I will back"
158,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Oh my word! This place is delicious. Best I‚Äôve had in a long time. Margaritas are so yummy! Steak tacos, queso, enchiladas- everything is delicious!"
159,Los Pilones, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I have been to Los Pilones many times before but their new menu was limited.
The food didn‚Äôt taste of anything, was bland and when I informed the staff, they were not helpful. ‚Ä¶"
160,Los Pilones, 2 stars ,7 years ago,"We went there very excited since we are big fans of the mexicain kitchen but we left a bit disappointed. The service was arrogant and really not the best.  The food is really overpriced and not really special.  Anyway it  has a great decoration and the drinks, fresh lemonade and mojito were very good."
161,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Finally! Good, Real! Mexican food! We've been searching for this ever since we left southern California!  This place is highly recommended to anyone who knows negra modelo and great mole sauce (with just a hint of chocolate). Couldn't recommend it higher! Our Amsterdam favorite!"
162,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"I really liked the food, but have no reference for how Mexican it really is. The drinks however I can judge and would rate them excellent!! Will visit again."
163,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I was really happy to find this restaurant in the city. The tacos were delicious and the margaritas üëå. The waitress were very friendly and the atmosphere really makes feel good . Highly recommended.
164,Los Pilones, 1 star ,2 years ago,"44 euros for 2 tequila shots and 2 glasses of bad warm white wine. üëé
This is not okay ‚Äì especially if you don‚Äòt ‚Äöwarn‚Äò your customers before you serve. Nobody would expect that a tequila shot costs 17,50‚Ç¨."
165,Los Pilones, 1 star ,2 years ago,The owner of Los Pilones is a very cold person and not welcoming back guests likes us who were frequent visitors when living there. Now we live abroad and came back twice the owner welcomed us with a very cold welcome. We advise do not go to this place. The service is not worth it.
166,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,a year ago,Always a good place to eat.  Real Mexican food with friendly staff and enough variety of meals and drinks.
167,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The best Mexican restaurant in Amsterdam recently improved it's recipes. It's not as good as the real deal in Mexico, I'm told, but it's very tasty and the service is great and fast so 5 stars!"
168,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Since H√©ctor and his 2 brothers came to Amsterdam in 2001, the food scene was a real Mexican restaurant richer. Not the fake Tex-Mex stuff you'll find in any tourist hell, but true Mexican recipes like puntas de res, Mole, carnitas, etc. ‚Ä¶"
169,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely mexican restaurant, will go back."
170,Los Pilones, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere. Chips were crispy and the salsa tasty. The tacos were, well tacos. I just wish the tap beer were from Mexico as well. Can't have it all I suppose. ‚Ä¶"

181,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I love the ""new"" place in Kerkstraat! I think the food has improved and the service at this location is great. The girls working there were very friendly. I already like the other Pilones and I'm happy to see changes for the better!"

183,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good Mexican food, but small portions and high prices. Probably because it's small and in the center they have a big demand. Still a good place for Mexican authenticity."

189,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Seriously some of the best Mexican food in all of the Netherlands. The brothers who opened this place are straight from Mexico and have brought that delicious flavour to Amsterdam.
190,Los Pilones, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Mango margaritas are a must. My favorite is the chicken soup which is cheese, rice, chicken in a creamy corny broth. Avocado, lemon, cilantro and fresh chillies on the side. Lovely!"

196,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice place and good food. The flautas de pollo was a bit tastless. We also ordered the tacos with beef and it was really good!
197,Los Pilones, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Real good mexican food with nice service. But the food is a bit overprice, not enough food for a 20‚Ç¨ meal in my opinion. Coktails were great."
