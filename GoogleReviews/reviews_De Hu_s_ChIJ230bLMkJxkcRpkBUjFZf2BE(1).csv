0,De Hu's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Woow ... Asian tapas are delicious.  We had a surprise menu: the chef puts the best dishes on your table. Very good with friendly staff and a nice selection of wines.
1,De Hu's, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere and a really varied and tasty tapas menu, my favourite was the spicy tuna balls (not really spicy)"
2,De Hu's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food and drinks awesome, only downside was the wait for the food and the strange order in which things came out, one dish missed completely."
3,De Hu's, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is very good. Home made gyoza, juicy and fresh filling.  Spicy chicken wings were crunchy, yet succulent. Crunchy scallops were exactly that.  The interior is maybe a bit traditional and they could perhaps improve on that but the food makes up for it big time. Pleasant service as well."
4,De Hu's, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Good service, nice atmosphere, tasty food. However, the dishes came out SO slowly, and they forgot to send two of the seven plates we ordered. Tapas is supposed to be all on the table together or quite close together, but this came tasting ‚Ä¶"
5,De Hu's, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"The service is very slow, staff is incapable of managing the crowd! Clearly they are understaffed. The waitress said‚Äùif you are busy, you should not come here!‚Äù, for us, it is rude! Is it Dutch straightforwardness? ‚Ä¶"
6,De Hu's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Asian tapas bar where one can delight in Asian fingerfood. I'll start by saying that I still  do think the prices are too high for the small dishes one gets... (Hence the 3 and not 4 stars) But we enjoyed ourselves while choosing the 3 or 4 ‚Ä¶
7,De Hu's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It was very good and the waitress was really nice, not really expensive for what it is !"
8,De Hu's, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Restaurant looks good and it is comfortable.
Unfortunately the food that we ordered was not good. Bento box smaller then in photo and salmon was not fresh.  Service was also very slow (even when we were almost alone). Not really recommended!"
9,De Hu's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We are living in Amsterdam and always looking for gastronomic Asian food. I stumbled upon De Hu's through The Fork, I was looking for places who give discounts. Da Hu's currently has a promotion because they just opened their business. I ‚Ä¶"
10,De Hu's, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Presentation and plating was an unexpected surprise. Food was only meh. Pricing was high, but given the location, not out of the ordinary. The rolls weren't that awesome. The eel roll was subpar. The scallop roll was interesting because the sushi rice was toasted so it had a surprising texture."
11,De Hu's, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We loved the style of the restaurant, the service and the food. Great atmosphere, attentive staff. Highly recommended for a different take on Asian food."
12,De Hu's, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is perfection. Service is friendly but not over bearing. I love the music. The waitress is gorgeous, btw."
13,De Hu's, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"OK food (not amazing, but not bad). Really slow service. Noisy."

28,De Hu's, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Delightful little place outside the chaos of the canals. Yes, eat well and the price is absolutely fair to be in Amsterdam ‚Ä¶"
29,De Hu's, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Quiet place and it explains a lot, I will not be back for sure and tourists, not attentive staff, who sits at the window in the computer! Dimsams are fat and I can buy them myself in the supermarket. I do not ‚Ä¶"

31,De Hu's, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Quite expensive food and not very special portions.

32,De Hu's, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) An Asian tapas restaurant, that is, short portions. Elaborate and rich cuisine. The chicken with teriyaki sauce was spectacular.

34,De Hu's, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"(Translated by Google) Dim Sum: it's not bad, really good is different. Price / performance is out of proportion (overpriced, e.g. small pot of tea ‚Ç¨ 5, for 1 person ‚Ç¨ 34 for 12 small bites) ‚Ä¶"
