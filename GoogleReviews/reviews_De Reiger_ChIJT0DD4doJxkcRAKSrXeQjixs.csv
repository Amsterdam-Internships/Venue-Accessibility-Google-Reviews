0,De Reiger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The place is vibrant. When we came mostly locals were here. Menu is small but good also has some specials (daily or weekly). The service is ok, a bit slow and moody. The food also ok. I had the ribs and my friend had the steak. He ordered …"
1,De Reiger, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"De Reiger is a traditional Dutch bar and restaurant located on Nieuwe Leliestraat in the Jordaan District. This is one of the oldest eateries in the area having first opened its doors in 1896. Opening hours are 5pm to 12am (Tues to Fri), …"
2,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great little restaurant in the Jordan district! We sat outside, ate great food and drank tasty vino. The restaurant is not far from the tourist area and yet it feel you are eating like they locals do. I highly recommend it"
3,De Reiger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Cafe De Reiger is a little historic gastropub serving great food including fresh fish and Dutch classics. They DON'T take reservations, but don't let that discourage you, especially if you're eating before 7:45 or so. …"
4,De Reiger, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Very cozy brasserie, great service and great for lunch or dinner. We go there often!"
5,De Reiger, 4 stars ,3 months ago,"Friendly staff at this old pub, the owner has had the place for the past 40 years and seems lovely. Normal beer selection for the Netherlands."
6,De Reiger, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Probably one of the best place to have dinner in Amsterdam. Charming location, waiters and cooks friendly and very good food. It really worths it!"
7,De Reiger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Totally a hidden gem in the Jordan! Not especially cheap (rose fish for €21), but magnificently prepared with attention to detail. Excellent service, lovely ambience, all in all highly recommended."
8,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Mid range price; top range dining experience. Delicious food with attention to detail, friendly staff and a good ambience without being pretentious. Tried the taleggio ravioli, lamb with risotto, and raspberry and lime panacotta. With wine …"
9,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was amazing, they were closed the Monday we first stopped by and I am glad we tried again. Sat at the bar for a short wait since they were pretty busy. Everyone enjoyed their meals but my fish special was amazing. Would eat again!"
10,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This has been my favorite restaurant in Amsterdam so far! We came at the recommendation of a colleague in the states whose sister lives here. I guarantee you will not be disappointed if you eat here! If I could rate it higher than 5 stars, …"
11,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful little pub that makes everyone feel welcome. Excellent menu and helpful staff.
12,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Another ridiculously good review. We have been lucky in our dining choices here. De Reiger seems to specialize in game and stews. The lamb roulade was wonderfully lamby. My son had a dish of duck legs that had pellets in it. Now that’s real …
13,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We have been in Amsterdam for a week. We have walked  by this place several times. Had an awesome meal. What intrigued us is that it is a block from major tourist sites but incredibly  low key. Sidewalk or inside. We had mussels and salmon. High quality. My advice is ditch those other tourists and have a wonderful low key meal.
14,De Reiger, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Hadn't been there for several year but De Reiger immediately came into mind when I had to decide where to take a lady out for dinner. It proved to be an excellent choice. Service was friendly and good, the gambas starter we shared was very …"
15,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff are super friendly, the food is super delicious (and seasonal) and the place feels like a proper old neighbourhood pub. The changing specials are chalked up on a menu board (there is an English one too) and use local produce of the season. The mussels were awesome and huge!"
16,De Reiger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We were welcomed, staff so friendly and don't worry they obviously speak English as well and have a specials board in English.  Food was amazing, very professional. Don't, miss out on the desserts! Beer was great too.  You can just stop for …"
17,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I’m from San Francisco, California and a colleague  told me before I left, do not miss eating dinner at De Reiger. It’s in a charming neighborhood and the inside is inviting and cozy. The food was not only prepared very well, it was …"
18,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lunch at a place without English menus outside. Mussels, coq au Vin, lentil pea soup, and mushroom ravioli (and a burger and club sandwich). Great food. Fantastic service. For those looking to avoid the touristy places, De Reiger is great."
19,De Reiger, 1 star ,4 years ago,Didn't enjoy my dinner here. Staff was pre-occupied and not attentive to our group at all. Meals were VERY overpriced ... not that I would have minded if they were good. I ordered the shrimp dish as an entree which cost $21 euros. It …
20,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"AMAZING. worth the walk in -10 degree cold. What a lovely place and amazing food. So unassuming and that's what makes it even better. Had a lovely time here for my birthday meal. Thanks! When I'm back in Amsterdam, pretty sure I'd like to visit again."
21,De Reiger, 5 stars ,a year ago,"On a recommendation of a fellow Jerseyan, we went to De Reiner and it was all that was promised! We welcomed by a lovely bartender who offered warmth in her smile and grace. Starters of Pumpkin soup with chestnuts and mushrooms, and quinoa …"
22,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We've eaten here twice, taking a chance on a late-night walk in both times. Yesterday's ceviche was delicious, the ribs beautifully flavoured, the veg side perfect (a request the kitchen kindly accommodated), the service prompt and hospitable, the setting warm and comfortable. What else is there?"
23,De Reiger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"OMG - best spare ribs anywhere.  It might appear a little on the pricey side at first glance  but the value is exceptional.  Great food, excellent service. Multilingual staff. Good choice of drinks. Ideal  for people with older teens in tow also. Strong recommendation and worth looking for."
24,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved this place. Great food and drink. Friendly serving staff who know the menu well. Beautiful Dutch craftsmanship decor and an evocative atmosphere. Like a old movie set. Recommended.
25,De Reiger, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Good place for a beer and really well placed.
Service can improve. The ambiance and neighborhood is good."
26,De Reiger, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Highly recommended!
Great food, friendly staff, beautiful view to the Westerkerk!"
27,De Reiger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,This place is normally very busy and with very good reason.   The food is beautifully made and presented.   DIfferent food every time you go.  Nice selection of wines.   Sits in  the heart of the Jordaan in the main restaurant area and they are one of the best.
28,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Possibly the best meal of my two week visit!  This is not a touristy spot and a great way to feel like a local.  Not very expensive, but DELICIOUS!  I highly recommend this gem!"
29,De Reiger, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Arrived in the city on Friday evening as a group of 10 weary cyclists and came across this restaurant. Lovely intimate feel, great menu, amazing reception from the staff and miraculously they managed to squeeze us all in. Couldn't be happier and perhaps most importantly we were very happy with the food."
30,De Reiger, 5 stars ,10 years ago,Went there for dinner yesterday - it was totally packed with locals. Apparently it seemed very popular in the neighbor. Ordered black cod and iberico pork from a special menu and we were so satisfied. Chocolate mousse dessert was just amazing! Very great place we found in Amsterdam! Will visit soon :-)
31,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I walked in without a reservation. Often, as a single person, I am seated at a relatively unpleasant table. At de Rigeur I was asked where I wanted to sit! I immediately felt welcomed. The service was excellent, pleasant and timed just …"
32,De Reiger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Had a wonderful meal tonight - we are two vegetarians and they had multiple options for us. Food came quickly and was very tasty, also seemed like we were the only tourists in the place. Definitely recommended!"
33,De Reiger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"One of my favourite restaurants in the Jordaan. Affordable, good selection of beers to accompany your meal. Check out their ribs, they have been making these for a long time and have refined their recipe."
34,De Reiger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Tourist friendly but not Americanized.  Dinner options leaned toward upscale.  Good beer selection of course.  Can be easily identified since their oval beer sign is upside down.
35,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really good food, innovative, delicious and with plenty of options for vegetarians. Service is fast and friendly and the interior has a delightful old world charm. Highly recommended!"
36,De Reiger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Perfect! The food was delicious (I am french ^^) The place is well decorated and cosy. People over there are warm, nice and very helpfull! For example we lost the ring of my wife there and they sent us back by postal letter to France! Highly recommended!!!"
37,De Reiger, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice traditional Dutch pub, with friendly staff. Not busy at all on a Saturday for lunch - go for the traditional fare, really, those Holtkamp croquetten are like nothing you will get in Houndslow."
38,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,De Reiger is one of the oldest cafes in Amsterdam. The restaurant is located just outside the Jordaan neighborhood. The three of us managed to snag a table without a reservation by arriving shortly after they opened for dinner.
39,De Reiger, 3 stars ,9 years ago,Our 2nd time at De Reiger. The first time we were in a group of 10 and spent over 1200 euros. We had a great time but only because the service was laughable that we had to drink more to get over their rudeness. The 2nd time we went we took …
40,De Reiger, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We sat outside and had an outstanding meal with wonderful service.  I recommend the ribs and the pasta.  All of the food is very fresh.  We will definitely return for another meal.
41,De Reiger, 5 stars ,11 years ago,"The food was one of the best I've had in Amsterdam. it is abit expensive(minimum 20 euros for main dish), but it is worth it! the atmosphere is also nice, laid back old brown cafe type."
42,De Reiger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Loved it.  Stopped here on the recommendation of someone we met while having a few drinks at Café Brandon and he told us it was his favorite place.  Since it was on our way back to the hotel we tried it and now we can see why he raved about it.  The food was really good and priced very reasonable.
43,De Reiger, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The spare ribs were SO good!  Good service, great food, and a nice view of Westerkerk from our table.  A lovely meal for our last night in Amsterdam."
44,De Reiger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Stumbled upon this restaurant while in Amsterdam and glad we did. It is a simple place with helpful staff and quality food. No frills, just a good quality meal in a warm environment."
45,De Reiger, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"I'm a native to Amsterdam and have been to 'De Reiger' for about three or four times now. The prices are normal, it's not very cheap, but for the price you get a really good meal. Every time I went there the staff was very friendly and …"
46,De Reiger, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Great service good food.  I had the smoked salmon soup and the sea wolf fish.  Good sized portion and nice dinner.  This is a mild dish but good.
47,De Reiger, 5 stars ,12 years ago,"We had dinner at De Reiger last night - took a cab from the Renaissance Hotel.   The cab driver had never heard of thre place, and when we got there, it was in a semi-quiet neighborhood wuth a few folks sitting outside at tables.  I …"
48,De Reiger, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We were in Amsterdam visiting family and De Reiger was high on the list of places to go, based on a previous meal. The staff are super friendly and the food was fantastic. See you next time we are in town!"
49,De Reiger, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Amazing dinner had last night while sat on the patio.  Staff was very welcoming, food was presented beautifully and tasted even better.  Will return without question!"
50,De Reiger, 1 star ,2 years ago,Really poor. Came here for a post-boat tour beverage but was told we could only stay here if we were ordering food as it would be busy for dinner. Wouldnt even allow us to stay if we ordered snacks and drinks.There were plenty of tables and it wasn't busy at all... very disappointing!!

52,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Cool spot, good vibe, nice bar. Had some very good ribs. Was an overall enjoyable experience. Very homey"
53,De Reiger, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Pricey but quality. Excellent prime ribs and fish of day. God knows why it was rather empty among the sea of empty eateries surrounding it.
