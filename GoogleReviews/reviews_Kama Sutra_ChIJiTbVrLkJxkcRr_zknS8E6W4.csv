Taste was pretty average for main course ( tandori mix) and drinks were extremely bland ( sweet lassi), considering the price and value, drinks are a rip off. Service time is longer than normal. Staff was very helpful and polite."
29,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,8 months ago,"Order Ayam Malaka, the picture and the food are exactly not the same! They cook Indonesian food in Indian style! Sorry but this is infuriating, best too take out Indonesian menu out of your menu"

41,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We went there twice already. On Sunday first time after few years,and the quality is still the same-great!! We had a rice table,and it was plenty! Service is also friendly and attentive. Now with the virus around ,the table next to us was also cleaned with the antibacterial thing-good precautions. Recommend!"
42,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is a lovely little restaurant tucked into the pedestrian streets of Amsterdam that we found quickly after leaving the central station. The food was divine, with perfect serving sizes, and quickly made. Rupak, our server, was friendly ‚Ä¶"
43,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,a year ago,I went to this restaurant. Due to Corona situation we all know that it is only take away. So the price of the food was different in the menu which was sticked on the glass and the price was more in the menu which was in the restaurant. They have sticked the label of the increased price. Some kind of cheating. I would not recommend here.
44,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good place for authentic indian cuisine. Quality and quantity was good. Helpful staff and cozy ambience.
45,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good Indian restaurant with affordable pricing. The ordered food had authentic taste and the service is commendable as well. The host, Rupak is a friendly chap and he can customize the dishes according to the spice level."
46,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We had a wonderful dinner. The food was spicy in the right amount to make us sweat, but not cry.... The service was attentive and friendly and the price was really good for what we had. I have left my hat in the place and they have kept it ‚Ä¶"

49,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,2 years ago,"This is one of such restaurant where Indians can't get respect.  We located this place, initially ordered a snack but we were told that we need to order at least one main dish. I have eaten in several Indian restaurants and eateries but ‚Ä¶"
50,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We waited more than 30 Minutes for the Indian Tee (which tasted like water with Black tea Aroma and milk..)

51,Kama Sutra, 3 stars ,5 months ago,As of 10.10.2021 terrible service spilled red wine on my wife

54,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Especially for vegetarians out there, this is not the place for you. Look for other Indian restaurants nearby,there are plenty in Amsterdam. ‚Ä¶"
55,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious Indian food. I can especially recommend the vegetarian menu, it‚Äôs a 3-course dish with all the best you could imagine. And of course when it comes to drinks, there‚Äôs nothing better than a glass of mango lassie!!!"
56,Kama Sutra, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Its near to redlight district hence the name is like this but its suggested for families. If you walk from train station its hardly 15 mins. Restaurant is simple. Food is good not excellent compared to Indian restaurants. Service was not ‚Ä¶
57,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,a year ago,"Order indonesian food, not even close with any indonesian food taste. Soto ayam doesn't taste like soto ayam, it's only egg and bean sprouts and lemon grass. This are more like thai food taste. Also very greasy it actually hard to swallow because of too much oil and messy taste"
58,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Kamasutra is my #1 spot for Indian food in central Amsterdam. I order from here on a regular basis; the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. I usually order food to be delivered from here, but I dine in on occasion as well. The ‚Ä¶"

62,Kama Sutra, 4 stars ,2 years ago,We enjoyed the thali rijstafel! Everything was delicious and we especially liked the lentil dahl and the mango lassi. The waiting time is a bit long but the waitress serving us was very friendly and polite so we didn't mind the wait! ‚ù§Ô∏è
63,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Not a good experience. I was kind of forced to buy a 5 eur  water bottle, with a fake story of unsafe tap water in Amsterdam. Credit card machine was apparently not working and I was asked to draw cash from a particular ATM suggested just ‚Ä¶"
64,Kama Sutra, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Truly excellent  experience overall. Seated right away at a table of my choosing. Ordered the Chicken Tika Masala and Garlic Naan.

67,Kama Sutra, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great & delicious indian food restaurant in busy area of Amsterdam central.Also here you can get Indonesian food.

70,Kama Sutra, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Very good quality Indian food.  The tandoori chicken was our favorite. Lentils are spicy which was great.  Servers were friendly.  Get the seat in the window if you can.
71,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Best indian in Amsterdam. New owners but same chef. Table in window is best seat in the house. Watching the street action and good fresh food.  Perfect
72,Kama Sutra, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Pretty mediocre Indian fair served in a clean but otherwise plain setting.  The service is a little brusque but the food is reasonably priced.  Overall, if you're in a jam and craving Indian food, this will do but otherwise give it a miss.  There are better places to eat in Amsterdam."
73,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Horrendous service, food which was ordered was not served. Was served a different dish (less amount) and still the amount was charged for the dish (more amount) that was ordered. Did not stay to dispute as the vibe was utterly disappointing. If you need Indian food, please Do Not visit this place."
74,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I had to wait for an hour for a tea, that was brought after main dish and was like water. Food was so so and personal not so nice. They also had no beer from the tap."

79,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Not worth a visit. Idian restaurant without spicy food. I didnt know this exist. Now I know better. Ordered Samosa, got 2 pieces which werent good. Too dry. Got main plate chicken tandoori, which usually is done with loads of spices. Its my ‚Ä¶"

86,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,2 years ago,One of the worst Indian restaurant that exists in the world :( . They have the worst Biriyani which is not Biriyani but rasam rice. And when we ordered tandoori mix who in the world would put curry on top of tandoori. Please avoid this restaurant. There are much much better ones in amsterdam
87,Kama Sutra, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"I used to hang out at a friends house when we were kids and his mom made the most incredible indian food, they where indian. This place is as good as homemade indian food, if you are looking for a real authentic indian meal this is the place for you. And you have to eat the samosa as a starter, they are insane."
88,Kama Sutra, 1 star ,2 years ago,We felt cheated with the money we spent on our food and quality of food served to us. We asked for suggestions and in return we were fleeced even more. A pretty disappointing experience.
