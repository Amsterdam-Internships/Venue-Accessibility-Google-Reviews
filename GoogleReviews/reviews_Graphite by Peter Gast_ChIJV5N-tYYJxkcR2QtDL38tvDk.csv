0,Graphite by Peter Gast, 2 stars ,4 months ago,The allure is for sure a major draw card as is the food but the service falls short on many levels for a Michelin star restaurant. If the staff and chef are not in sync itâ€™s a overshadow experience. Arrived at 7.30.  Asked for a cocktail in â€¦
1,Graphite by Peter Gast, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Everything was perfect! Food, service, atmosphere. We had 8 courses lunch menu. All flovours we tasted were admirable. They have also very good wine selection. Highly recommended. And we will go for a dinner as well"
2,Graphite by Peter Gast, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Wonderful overall experience. I wonâ€™t spoil it for you as they want to keep the interiors and some elements a surprise. We took the 10-course option - I was with 3 other vegetarians while I had the regular menu. Both options are fab, â€¦"
3,Graphite by Peter Gast, 4 stars ,5 months ago,This is one of the places that you visit for the dining experience. It is set up in a club-like atmosphere so it was not surprising that we ended up spending close to 4hours for lunch. The flavours were exquisite and well defined. They have â€¦

5,Graphite by Peter Gast, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This restaurant turns fine dining into an experience. There is no doorbell you have to use a QR code to enter the place. We were welcomed with amazing cocktails. The host seated us next to a small kitchen where a chef prepared our food. We â€¦

7,Graphite by Peter Gast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere and great service. Some of the dishes are more interesting, some not that much, but the Lobster dish and the mushroom foam were to die for!"
8,Graphite by Peter Gast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Glossy, slick and well-manicured 'concept' restaurant with attentive staff, creative menus and an intimate 'cabaret for families' kinda vibe (think black-netting curtains, velvet-cushion-linked sunken booths and stage lighting set to the â€¦"

12,Graphite by Peter Gast, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved the place. We had the 10 course menu, and every single dish was DELICIOUS. Great service too. Go and check it out! Itâ€™s a must! Weâ€™ll definitely go back. Next challenge - The 15 course menu ðŸ™‚"
13,Graphite by Peter Gast, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"A little overpriced I would say, We had a 15-course go, but some of the courses were really not interesting, or very tiny (although after 15 courses you are always super full anyway) â€¦"
