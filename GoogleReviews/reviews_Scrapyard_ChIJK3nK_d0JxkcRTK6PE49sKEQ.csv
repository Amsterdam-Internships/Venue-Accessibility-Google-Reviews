0,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,5 months ago,The venue has been used for various pop-up concepts but this review is for @burritoburt tacos and his cocktail wizard partner. The tacos are legit California mex style. He mixes it up with different meats/veggies and there‚Äôs always a plate ‚Ä¶

9,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,6 years ago,We came here in June during a 1 month trip around Europe. What a find! We stopped by twice after a long day walking the city. We had a great time trying the local beers and snacking on the baconaise fries. The bartender was a really cool dude from London. Thanks!
10,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great bar, really relaxed with the best cocktails in Amsterdam! We also had food and it was yummy. Very friendly nothing was too much trouble!!!"
11,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Yes, we were the guys who worked through the whole cocktail menu, they were all excellent, so why not!  A bit out of the way but we combined with a trip on a Mokum Boot so it was the perfect stop nearby to relax after that."
12,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Hidden gem with quite possibly the best cocktails in Amsterdam. Owner is super friendly and the music selection is out of this world :)
13,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Really tasty bbq! Ribs were good, chicken wings were fantastic and the Mac & Cheese with korean style meat was oh SO GOOD.   Wash it all down with a cocktail üçπüêªüëçüèº"
14,Scrapyard, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool super friendly staff and good imperial stout, a good local neighbourhood bar... chatted up some random folks all of which were totally responsive and relaxed. ‚Ä¶"
15,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Ever changing chefs,  eve changing crazy cocktails,  cool art.  All over a great addition to Amsterdam.  Could use some better speakers though ;)"
16,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Cool place, nice selection of local craft beers and a menu of different gin & tonics, very laid back, very friendly staff, cool place for a few drinks with friends"
17,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Kind of a weird location but great spot inside! Nice folks, epic comfort food and drinks menu. Fried chicken sandwich was dope!"
18,Scrapyard, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Nice entourage but I was very disappointed in the knowledge of the craft beers served. Was hoping for a nice experience with local beers but left with a sour taste.
19,Scrapyard, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Nice and cozy cafe&bar to meet with friends and chill out. Friendly staff and a good cocktail menu!
