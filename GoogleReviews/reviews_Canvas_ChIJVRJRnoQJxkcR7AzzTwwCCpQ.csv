0,Canvas, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Very cozy and lovely cafe and rooftop as well. The cafe downstairs looks like a nice place to work on days where not so many meetings are going on. The rooftop has an impressive view, definitely the kind of place where to bring your friends ‚Ä¶"
1,Canvas, 4 stars ,2 weeks ago,"Place is amazing. It has good vibes. View is also good. It's located on 7th floor and the staff is super friendly.
There is not much variety in the food and drinks. Also I didn't like the cold ‚Ä¶"
2,Canvas, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Very nice bar with beautyful view on the city of Amsterdam. We had an Aperol Spritz, it was small but done in the right ptoportions. Personnel was super kind, for instance they were almost closing and so they told us asking if it was fine. ‚Ä¶"
3,Canvas, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"It is really nice, good food, good environment and sympathize staff."
4,Canvas, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"A really pretty location and the staff is extremely nice.
Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt enjoy the food as much. It took about 5 mins for us to get our main courses but we had to wait 20 mins for us to get the bread we had ‚Ä¶"
5,Canvas, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Lunch experience was excellent. Price/quality ratio very good, expecially given the unique location. Service was nice, did not bother too much but still payed attention when you needed something.
Would recommend."
6,Canvas, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Unfortunately we ate our food before i could make a photo üòÑ
We had chicken wings with fries and red beet with blue cheese salad. It was delicious! ü§§ ‚Ä¶"
7,Canvas, 4 stars ,a year ago,Nice dinner all great heights. The cheese plate was a bit disappointing though. The view is great!
8,Canvas, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great place, great view, but be careful when you go to the bathroom. There's a feeling of no privacy."
9,Canvas, 3 stars ,4 months ago,"For starters, really don‚Äôt recommend their artichoke(horrible) and meatball(not that good). We didn‚Äôt order main food, so can‚Äôt comment on it. However, the view is awesome, and the music is always good there."
10,Canvas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Canvas is the restaurant on the top floor of the Volkshotel in the former Volkskrant building. Can be reached very easily by Metro 51, 53 or 54 from Central Station. It serves pretty good food and gorgeous cocktails ... has a relaxed vibe ‚Ä¶"
11,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Just the view from the 7th floor was worth a visit! The place was very busy on a Friday night but the staff was efficient and attentive. The wait for the food very reasonable. I loved the salad with a dressing with just a hint of onion, and I ate asparagus bearnaise and they were good. Definitely recommend this play! just at the subway."
12,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely dinner spot with great views of the city!
Dinner was great and the staff were very very kind, and Genuine. The chicken wings appetizer was very good and the stammpot was worth trying! The cheesecake was delicious!
Would recommend!"
13,Canvas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great cocktails and view of Amsterdam. I went here in the middle of the week and it was very empty but still lots of fun. You have to take the elevator on the left side after entering the building to get up.
14,Canvas, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Nice rooftop location. Ok food, but definitely would recommend for the complete experience."
15,Canvas, 1 star ,6 months ago,After 1 hour waiting they served us small portions of food. If you're a gnome or a hobbit it's okay. If you're a person you'll have to eat kebab afterwards.
16,Canvas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One place to go if you are looking for a rooftop. Amazing views and nice menu
17,Canvas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Nice roof terrace in Amsterdam East on the Top floor of Volks Hotel. Great 180 degree view of Amsterdam. Normal prices , friendly staff."
18,Canvas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"A view with good food, environment,  friendly staff,... and so much more."
19,Canvas, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Great staff, good food. But it took desert 20 minutes to turn up?!"
20,Canvas, 1 star ,5 months ago,Tiny portions and very poor quality. Store bought ingredients - nothing fresh. It's not worth the price you pay.
21,Canvas, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Nice rooftop place, good food. Very fast but also a bit unpersonal staff. Nice experience overall"
22,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I really like it. Great food and view.
23,Canvas, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice location for drinks with an outdoor terrace. The service on the terrace is slow, but the cocktails were nice. Their menu offers plenty of vegan options and the staff inside is much more attentive and service oriented. They are very ‚Ä¶"
24,Canvas, 4 stars ,5 months ago,Very affordable drinks and nice vibe but the view isn't as nice as I thought it would be
25,Canvas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Beautiful views, fabulous food and great service"
26,Canvas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I was staying in the Volkshotel so I went to Canvas for breakfast. The sunrises over Amsterdam were awesome (see the attached photo). The food was good, about what you find in most EU hotels that offer breakfast: yogurt, various breads, cheeses, cuts of meat, eggs, bacon, cereal, and so on."
27,Canvas, 3 stars ,9 months ago,"We booked a table for dinner last Sunday for 2 people, when arriving we got assigned to a bench with a little side table, we asked the waitress that brought us there if we could have the (normal) table in front of us, im pregnant and to eat ‚Ä¶"
28,Canvas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice place to spend a fun afternoon having a drink with a nice view of Amsterdam. Also suitable for staying longer hours as the restaurant-bar becomes more of a bar-club afterwards.  A recommended place approved by quiqiunn stars
29,Canvas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great - place - spot - environment - amazing view. ideal to any occasion - any time of the day
30,Canvas, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"A bit fresh, having to sit outside. 5star view on a better day!!! Canvas cannot help that, covid rules. What cost them a star is the less than perfect coffee after lunch."
31,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really good place with good view of the city. Love the lighting and overall ambiance. Offers good food and drinks. The menu is not too big but good variety. Vegan friendly too. Happy and cheerful staff - adds to the whole experience. One must try this place. :)
32,Canvas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had an amazing experience. The manager on place was very nice and remembered my name, tell me bye by my name. I really enjoyed it. The food was amazing and very not expensive. We had an amazing dinner. Thank you so much"
33,Canvas, 1 star ,5 months ago,"Food was unfortunately rather poor taste, flavour and quality wise and the portions very small."
34,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great spot at the top of the Volkshotel. Loved the atmosphere and left my gf for the oatmeal cookies which came straight from the oven. üòç
35,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Bar in a hotel but feels much nicer and bigger.  We came from London for NYE here and had a blast. Food was great and on time.  Views are great too.  Staff were really nice, facilities were great although I found it weird that there's HUGE ‚Ä¶"
36,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Great environment and beautiful view on the city
37,Canvas, 5 stars ,4 months ago,One on my favorite places in Amsterdam. Great spot
38,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Good hotel. Even though a bit dark but was interesting. Staff courteous and helpful. Hot tub was way too hot for folks. They were complaining how hot it was and 3rd tub was out of view until you accidentally spot it..water could be cooler ‚Ä¶
39,Canvas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,They have good rooms with great foods! The prices are fair and the food quality is high.
40,Canvas, 1 star ,2 years ago,"0-stars! Very annoyed and unfriendly staff. No greetings when you enter the place, barely talking with an unsatisfied facial expression. Forgot our order and wanted us to pay twice for the bill?! ‚Ä¶"
41,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"my go to place when I want to disconnect from the fast amsterdam life. Incredible 360 views to contemplate with a fairly priced beer. Never tried the food, but a nice odour emancipating from the kitchen. ü§™"
42,Canvas, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place, beautiful view, friendly staff and good food!"
43,Canvas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice view and relaxed terrace, really like the venue and chilled atmosphere. Unfortunately the food on the other hand is very average and not at all memorable. Pretty limited menu, vegetarian friend ate something that looked horrible and ‚Ä¶"
44,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went for dinner on a Wednesday evening. Atmosphere was intimate, lighting and the view was beautiful. Friendly staff and a delicious meal. Ordered the parelgort and stamppot. And for desert had a delicious cheesecake. Would recommend this place."
45,Canvas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Didn't know the place even though I live right around the corner, but a friend recommended it to me. A very cool place to go to. Amazing view of the city at night on top of the hotel. The waiter was extremely friendly and the snacks were excellent. I liked the decoration too."
46,Canvas, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Our dinner was... OK. Excellent steak , really... starting with burata and green beans pure.  Cheese plate was a joke.  And service totally unacceptable. This was the first time I have the filling to be unexpected..... not welcome."
47,Canvas, 3 stars ,a year ago,Main courses are very small and too expensive. 5 brussels sprouts cut in half and fried with a spoon of hummus costs 12 euros as a main dish. 5 stars for the view and 1 star for the food
48,Canvas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Sitting outside on the roof terrace enjoying the view, the people and the sun more than their service. When there aren't a lot of guests and you work the area with 3 girls it shouldn't take too long to come bring us the menu, take our ‚Ä¶"
49,Canvas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Beautiful view, friendly staff and good drinks."
50,Canvas, 2 stars ,7 months ago,"Okay food, pricey. Alright for an impromptu, unsatisfactory for a planned night out."
51,Canvas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"The 19.5‚Ç¨ entrecote is a total rip off: meat quality is terrible, the steak is tiny, poorly cooked and over salted. It also does not come with a side.
The salad also needs some improvement, it comes with so much caned chickpeas ‚Ä¶"
52,Canvas, 5 stars ,a year ago,Great service and attentive staff. Small food selection but good quality and fairly priced. Unique atmosphere.
53,Canvas, 5 stars ,8 months ago,The service is fast and very kind. The atmosphere is always nice and the drinks very good!
54,Canvas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Rooftop bar was only 1/2 full yet it took 20mins for someone to take our order and another 20mins to get served the drinks. Even tried to order at the bar, and was told to order outside. Great spot on a sunny day, but not worth it for the terrible service."
55,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very friendly bar staff, fast service, great view from the restaurant. I have been served by Stefan and he really made me feel welcomed and at home. Would definitely recommend to visit."
56,Canvas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good food, amazing old school DJ, timely and polite service. And to top it off best views in East Amsterdam without the usual rooftop tax in prices."
57,Canvas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"I use to visit this place a long time ago when there were still swatters and no hotel. It always stuck in my mind as a great venue due to the high floor, large open air balcony and cocktail menu. ‚Ä¶"
58,Canvas, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Good view, friendly staff, cheap drinks"
59,Canvas, 1 star ,5 years ago,"I was very disappointed with my experience last night at Canvas. From the start, the waiter was rude and unprofessional. We were not allowed to sit outside being told that they will close in 15 minutes, although they closed almost an hour ‚Ä¶"
60,Canvas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome view, unique place. I‚Äôm not giving 5 starts because some of the dishes were overpriced and not tasty like the steaks that 2 of my friends ordered it was full of nerves not very nice quality. Other than that I really enjoyed the coctels and the live music!!"
61,Canvas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cocktails are pretty good. Not easy to find relatively decent cocktail for a reasonable price.
Food is pretty good too. Nothing to write home about but ok. In summer, sitting outside with the view is spectacular!"
62,Canvas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Awesome rooftop bar with a really cool view of the city. The terrace can be very crowded and the drinks are a tad expensive, but well made. Try the Long Island, they don‚Äôt skimp on the alcohol."
63,Canvas, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Great view! Friendly staff. Fantastic place for a night with your loved one. And the best priced rooftop bar ever... üòÉ Don't know about the food, but they do great G&T's"
64,Canvas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Very nice rooftop bar/restaurant view nice views. We went here as an alternative to the Skylounge in the central station area which was crazy expensive. The prices here are very affordable, and the food is splendid. Service was a bit lousy but nothing to be worried about. Both ik inside and outside seating."
65,Canvas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,I went to the terrace in the summer! I really enjoyed the view but besides that there's not much: there's snacks and finger food for you to try which was tasty. You can reach the terrace by elevator and park behind the place. It's good for you to chat and spend a warm afternoon but do not expect greatness for lunch
66,Canvas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We had a really great dinner at Canvas. Tried steaks and they were delicious! Staff was super nice. Music not so much, but it all depends on a taste."
67,Canvas, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Great views. Food was good. Service was very slow. The server was more interested in chatting up the girls at another table than bothering to serve us.
68,Canvas, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Atmosphere was good. But wow the food was so bad. The cabbage with almonds was literally 1/4 of a cabbage, in one piece, on a plate with a few almonds.
And the chicken, what shall I say, KFC chicken is better."
69,Canvas, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"Great view, but really slow Service."
70,Canvas, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great location and really nice rooftop
71,Canvas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice bar and bistro on the 7th floor of the cool Volkshotel. Amazing views over Amsterdam, nice cocktails and nice food. Want something vegan? Just ask and they'll make it for you. On Friday and Saturday nights it turns into a cool club. Worth the trip! Friendly staff too."
72,Canvas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,There aren't a lot of rooftop terraces in Amsterdam so this is a great option for a sunny day. The staff is very friendly. Although they did not have any vegan options on the menu the chef was more than happy to prepare me a delicious vegan bulgur salad.
73,Canvas, 3 stars ,a year ago,Nice staff and view. Would recommend for drinks and 'snacks'. Main courses are very small and overpriced.
74,Canvas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of the best burger in town (check out Volt on FBstraat and the Rotisserie for other contenders) and a great view (7th floor) of the city. Come before 5pm though for the burgers as they change the menu for the evening.
75,Canvas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Mediocre food but that's to be expected with Dutch dishes like bitterballen. However the atmosphere is great and theres a nice view of the city. It also turns into a club at night at the weekend.
76,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I love this place every time I come to Amsterdam I eat here, amazing setup also the viel croquettes are very good ! Great service overall ! Staff are friendly and helpful !"
77,Canvas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Nice place for some drinks
Would highly recommend it during summer, the view and the weather give the place a special vibe"

The lockers to put your stuff are on the ground floor. So store your stuff ‚Ä¶"
79,Canvas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Breakfast was ok ok, not so good. Not worth 13 Euros. If you are vegetarian like me, then won't suggest spending 13 euros for croissant, bread and butter."
80,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went for dinner on a Wednesday evening. Atmosphere was intimate, lighting and the view was beautiful. Friendly staff and a delicious meal. Ordered the parelgort and stamppot. And for desert had a delicious cheesecake. Would recommend this place."
81,Canvas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Amazing view and good food. Best for drinks or dinner. Not that good when it comes to parties. Worth checking for sure

93,Canvas, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Nice rooftop with some hot bitterballen, if you get what I mean üòè."
94,Canvas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very great place to spend an evening, a bit far from the centre, almost quarter an hour cycling but it's definitely worth it, I fell in love with the place the moment I saw it, great views, cool people and a generally chill atmosphere. Perfect."
95,Canvas, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"If weather is good, the terrace on top of the hotel is great. Inside is pretty ""meh"" lately. Old version of Canvas was way better."
96,Canvas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The view, cappuccino and onion rings are definitely recommended...!!"
97,Canvas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great rooftop terrace with a decent view of Amsterdam. Music is a matter of taste, but the cocktail are excellent."

104,Canvas, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great view while enjoying a beer!
105,Canvas, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"You may be tempted to visit the restaurant for its view. Unfortunately, the food is nothing special and the serving sizes are small. The service is not something to boast about either."
106,Canvas, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great view on rooftop, cool decor and fabulous cocktails. Also great place to work remotely during the daytime"
107,Canvas, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We went to the rooftop, really friendly and nice staff. Extra point for the cool design üëå"
108,Canvas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Great place! Cappuccino was good aswell. Too bad the students at the table close to use were extremely loud and childish
109,Canvas, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Romantic place with a good selection of cocktails, astonishing view. Never been happy about the service tho."
110,Canvas, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"View is excellent, service was decent and had great atmosphere with some chilled music. Good choice. You will need to book"

115,Canvas, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Waiter was rude, immature, and knew very little to nothing regarding the menu. Not that the menu was that great either. I had a burger elsewhere, afterwards."
116,Canvas, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"A bit too chique for my taste, but great place nonetheless. Has views from the top (7th) floor, which is quite unique in Amsterdam ;)"
117,Canvas, 3 stars ,5 years ago,Went for lunch to this place as we were staying at the Volks hotel but were put off from the restaurant as we did not get the service with a smile... I'm 26 (so not too old fashioned) and know that it makes the world of difference if the waiter/waitress does not provide the service with a smile.
118,Canvas, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Perfect location, view and surprising menu! Just bit slow and not dedicated waiters"
