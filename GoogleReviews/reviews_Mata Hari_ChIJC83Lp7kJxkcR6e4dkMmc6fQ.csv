6,Mata Hari, 1 star ,a month ago,"1 star because they check QR codes as well as your ID, so if you're not into discrimination just take your money somewhere else. They enjoy collaborating with the government here."

15,Mata Hari, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Food is good but service very strange, don't know what they are serving and the rules they have made are strickt.

30,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,2 years ago,French fries were amazing. Fried chicken was good. The view of the water in the canal was great. Service was okay.

34,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The rib eye with truffle butter was perfect, and the hand cut fries made a great side.  Meat was not overdone, nice pink and juicy, worth every cent!  Had a few glasses of whiskey which the waitress was very attentive and checked to make sure I was happy periodically.  Overall excelt service and great food! No complaints."

41,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"This is a great spot to soak in the red light district without being in the middle. It's tucked down the side near the canal with a ton of cute cafe tables outside or a pub feel inside. They have a great wine and beer selection, but do …"

interior: 9/10
staff: 8/10 …"
43,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great selection of Asian and Italian elements in local flavor. Not a tourist attraction. Nice and cozy. Great bar with appetizers. Delicious dinner. Elegant. Affordable.
44,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food and cocktails but the service left a little to be desired. Had to flag the waiter down and ask to order more drinks and then remind them we ordered more drinks. Food was good enough that I'd go back anyways!
45,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Popped in for a drink in the evening. Great bar with reasonably priced wine. One of the nicer places to drink on this street, compared to all the pubs full of tourists. This Bar attracted a good mix of people."
46,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A nice cosy bar where you can escape the tourist masses of the Red Light District. Great staff.
47,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great drinks and amazing ambience by the canal. Love the retro decor, tulip lamps and the jazzy-bluesy music. Anyone going in late note that they stop serving food after 10:30pm, but completely worth it for the drinks alone!"
48,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Located just after some of the busiest part of the red light district. You do not expect any nice restaurants here. But this is good. An interesting menu with dutch, Italian and middle eastern influences."

52,Mata Hari, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Shockingly bad food today. Been there before with overall positive experience. Today all food was cold. Angus Hamburger had been microwaved but cold inside and rock hard. Sent it out, waited for 30 minutes and out comes a burger that was …"
53,Mata Hari, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite Good food and nice that they have a healthy touch and vegetarian options. Downside was that I only wanted to drink water and they came with a bottle, then I said I just wanted tap water but they then replied they don’t serve that. …"
54,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I think this is the one and only proper bar / restaurant in the Red Light District. And these guys are not just proper, this is good. Real good! Lovely dishes for dinner, and a wide selection behind the bar. …"
55,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Excellent food, friendly staff and good vibe! It can be busy, so recommended to make a reservation. But it's a great place to eat, especially if you're out and about in the city. It's a great spot in the lively center of Amsterdam."
56,Mata Hari, 1 star ,2 years ago,"It is the only place I have been in Eurpoe, the USA and Asia that has ever told me to put my shoes back on. In a 'hey man were cool kind of way'; they are not cool; they are the direct descendants in the ideals of both Mussolini and the …"
57,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Nice decor. The food was great, but not really big portions so if you're starving, you might not be  entirely fulfilled. Staff made an effort for a big group. Service was very good for Amsterdam standards."
58,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great atmosphere and service. Food is also good but the dishes are not that big. It’s quite busy so make sure to put yourself on the list and enjoy a drink at the bar while waiting
59,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Gorgeous bar with a great atmosphere. Great location but not right in the centre of the district so it's not too loud or crowded. Dry good drinks
60,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Found this cute just out of the way bar restaurant at the end of the red light district.  Excellent bites but not quite enough food for us. They also offered to make the shareables vegetarian which was greatly appreciated. Friendly staff. Busy place!
61,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely atmosphere, good lounge jazz, fresh food"
62,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Looking for a place close to our rental. This was an amazing find. Dishes were all excellent. Had antipasti, steak for dinner. Beef perfectly prepared.  The sides are really fresh and creative. Definitely recommend."
63,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Top notch drinks and food! 5- star interior. Only drawback was our male waiter upstairs who acted like he was a little too cool for school. His Female collegue was great though. Really worth a visit!
64,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"What a gorgeous gem in the middle of the nasty crowd of filthy bars and very cheap eetcafe, the red light can count on this beautiful bar right behind ""chinatown""! …"

Good deco. Good name. Toilet upstairs"
66,Mata Hari, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent place to be. Seems to be a hangout place for the locals. Packed to the brim for dinner. Food is delish and down to earth and light on your pocket. Not pretentious at all. Waitstaff were super friendly. Highly recommended. Great vibe as well.
67,Mata Hari, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Probably the worst meal experience I've had in Amsterdam. Completely oblivious staff. Ordered dinner, course for 2 at 6PM and we weren't served our order at all, even after 1 hour and 15 min. They kept saying its coming, yet others were …"
68,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Stayed here only for drinks. Don't order cocktails or mixed shots here, they re very lousy at making these. But otherwise service is good and choice if liquors is fine."
69,Mata Hari, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The interior is nice. The exterior is nice. But their interpretation of cocktails is pretty poor. Conservative on the good stuff, i.e. the booze. Get much nicer cocktails at, say, the W."
70,Mata Hari, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Really really cool but definitely too crowded! Very loud because of that. You risk to find no place because it might be all booked, they should consider to avoid bookings as many crowded places do and have success with!"
