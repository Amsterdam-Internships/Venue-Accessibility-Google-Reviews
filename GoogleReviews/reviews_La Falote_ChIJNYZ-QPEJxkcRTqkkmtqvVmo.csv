11,La Falote, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Unbelievably lovely spot. I felt happy to dine there alone but I'd happily take a date there too. Lovely atmosphere, charming and helpful staff and the foods all homemade and scrumptious. Generous portions and cheap for Amsterdam.  I totally recommend it. X"
12,La Falote, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The friendliest most wonderful waitress and staff. She let me ride her bike to the ATM to get cash since it was a cash only restaurant. My first time riding a bike in Amsterdam!! Also the food was absolutely incredible - beef was incredible tender and the bangers and mash were delicious. Also the soup rocked!
13,La Falote, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"The probably nicest stay in a restaurant I had in my entire life. The service is outstandingly nice and super helpful. Food was amazing, I really recommend the pea soup! In the end the chef even played a song and sang on the Terrasse just ‚Ä¶"

15,La Falote, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Staff could not have been more friendly and welcoming! We felt like we had been invited into someone's home for dinner. The food (schnitzel for me and stamppot for my mom) was so tasty. Before we left, my toddler was treated to an accordion performance. Such kindness from everyone, and the yummiest food! Definitely would recommend!"
16,La Falote, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"La Falote serves solid Dutch cooking with a good choice of menu including such items as stew, meatball, sausage, liver, but also a bit more upscale dishes such as steak and fish. All with several vegetables and cooked and fried potatoes. ‚Ä¶"
17,La Falote, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I really enjoy the food and the service... The chef was super nice and very cheerful...
18,La Falote, 4 stars ,9 years ago,"Delicious ""old fashioned"" Dutch food, something like eating at your grandmother's home  (if she is a good cook). Great homely feeling. Relaxed place for a dinner on your own, or with your partner. We ate there before a concert and enjoyed ‚Ä¶"
19,La Falote, 5 stars ,8 years ago,The food is great and the atmosphere is really nice. If you want authentic dutch food that's the place to go. The day I went I had the pleasure of seeing how they celebrate birthdays at La Falote. Amazing experience! The service is also very good.
20,La Falote, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Authentic Dutch food with Southern influences. Hidden gem with a lot of regulars. Recommended. Peter is an amazing guy! Bring cash! Not all Michelin food has to be very edgy. Strong all arounf stuff. The pudding with almonds and lavendel was great to finish the lunch off.
21,La Falote, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Various reviews rave about this place, which is why we went, but for the life of me I can‚Äôt understand why. It was a huge disappointment, and possibly one of the most mediocre meals I have ever had. The service was excellent, and the ‚Ä¶"

23,La Falote, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Seeing that La Falote was recommended in the tour guide I had, my wife and I decided to dine there for traditional Dutch food. It met every expectation in that regard. The stamppot was amazing and a little tip is to order the stewed pears. ‚Ä¶"
24,La Falote, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Is alright. Nothing much to cheer about. Somehow the arrangement of the food lead me to some thinking..
25,La Falote, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best Dutch restaurant ever. The owner is very nice and a gentleman. He gave us great suggestions and prepared our food by himself.
26,La Falote, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was alright, priced at around 20 euros per person for a single dish and a beer. The music and ambience was subpar and the service was a bit slow. Be aware that they might not accept your card, you will only find out after your dinner and you're asked to walk 10 minutes to an atm."
27,La Falote, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Overall bad experience due to the waitress, the food was tasty but maybe too light VS our expectations. The waitress suggested 2 traditional dishes and when we ordered she told us that they were not available anymore... We didn't had any ‚Ä¶"

34,La Falote, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Ordered salmon, which was undercooked, unsalted and with all the spines which made the dinner a very unpleasant situation. Care if you don't have debit card  because credit is not accepted (bring cash in that case)."
35,La Falote, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Worst experience! They place was empty, still it took them 10 min to bring us the menu, in addition they told us that no matter what we will order, they will charge us for main course, my wife wanted only soup, and it was unacceptable so we left without ordering."
36,La Falote, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely world class service. So friendly, funny, warm and engaging staff. Food was brilliant as well and the price is pretty good. I highly recommend"
