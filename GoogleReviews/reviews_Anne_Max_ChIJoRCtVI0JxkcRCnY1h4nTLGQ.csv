1,Anne&Max, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very nice place to eat breakfast. Their tea options are amazing and it comes with a pot, good enough for 2 people"
2,Anne&Max, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Lovely staff and delicious food. Some of the food and drinks on the more expensive side while others are nicely priced. Place I enjoy visiting and can recommend.
3,Anne&Max, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"A star less than five, only because (like almost all places of this type) the price for coffee is hard to justify. Nevertheless, great service, food and drink. Very kind and attentive staff. Recommended!"
4,Anne&Max, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"Friendly service but breakfast was really limit to bad. Don't take scrambled eggs with bread. You will receive an industrial tasteless avocado sauce, overcooked small portion of salmon or low quality bacon and overcooked watery eggs."

13,Anne&Max, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic views and fantastic food! The breakfast was divine! The service is friendly and efficient. The coffee is also very good.
14,Anne&Max, 3 stars ,a year ago,I have very mixed feelings about this place. We go there often for coffee with a pastry as it’s close to our house. We really like the coffee and the cakes are always tasty. The experience depends on the staff. Sometimes they are very …

As it got dark the place got super cosy with candles etc and the staff don't mind you staying for a while! Will definitely visit again. Only negative - it's quite pricey! Almost 7euro for just a small smoothie."
22,Anne&Max, 1 star ,2 years ago,"My 2 years old son and I were 21.02 in this cafe, and waiter from there told us that we have to leave, because my son had a loud fun there (loud laughter). They didn’t even let me finish my coffee, which I paid for. So, it is really a ❌bad …"

24,Anne&Max, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The is a delightful place. I love the sandwiches. Having high tea here is a must. Lots of vegan options as well. The ambiance and feeling is family friendly, great to hang out with friend or a relaxed date."
25,Anne&Max, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"It was a very nice and cozy place. A nice spot to drink your coffee before going to the grocery store. However, spending 9,45€ just for a small cappuccino and a black coffee is way too much. Especially because the waitress was insisting that we bought a croissant while we didn't, I will never go to that place again."
26,Anne&Max, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The staff was really friendly and helpful, making sure that when I placed my order I was going to get the correct thing (there are a few options that sound similar). I would however say, if you’re going to sit upstairs, be sure that someone …"
27,Anne&Max, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Food is good but the service is very bad. ...The waiters are not professional at all. Every time the serve coffee without sugar and every time you need to ask them. It takes ages to get served and to get what you ordered. It is very pitty because the place is nice .

30,Anne&Max, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Friendly staff, nice open view. Food is not bad, but is a little uninspired. Coffee is good, and there's some places with plugs for working with laptops. Would recommend if you're in the neighbourhood."
