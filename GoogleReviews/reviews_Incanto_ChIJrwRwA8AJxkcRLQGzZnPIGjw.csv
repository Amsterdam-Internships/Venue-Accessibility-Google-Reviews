29,Incanto, 1 star ,2 years ago,It is long time a go I didn't visit bad restaurant like Incanto. We couldn't complete our dishes. Service very bad and the prices is very high comparing your dish. 24 euro for spaciti with cheese. It is very high recommended NOT go there
30,Incanto, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The food was exceptional!!!  Service was equally aligned.  Very romantic with calming jazz music.  Had view overlooking city or not.  You are given the choice of seating.  I highly recommend for an authentic Italian experience!!!!
31,Incanto, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hidden on the first floor is restaurant Incanto. Going for lunch a bit early,  there were no other guests at all.

33,Incanto, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Very mediocre, overpriced Italian food.  Expectations were already tempered (this is the Netherlands after all), but, wow did this place disappoint.

41,Incanto, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Honestly I've not eaten here, but being a neighbor I've seen (and suffered myself) how your staff uses their ""breaks"" to be in the street harrasing girls that pass by, throwing kisses, whistling, etc. Still wearing the chefs outfit. Completely ridiculous, embarrassing and a great hint of their professionalism."
