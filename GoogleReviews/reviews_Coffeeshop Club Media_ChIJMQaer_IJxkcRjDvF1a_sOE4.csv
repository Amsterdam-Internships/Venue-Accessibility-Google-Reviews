0,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Brilliant Weed and Hash menu. Picked up some a champagne Haze. It smells like Cristal, tastes beaut and hits you hard! Great little place! A defo visit for anyone who likes Champagne!"
1,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,6 months ago,This is a must visit ! It is a very cosy and modern place. The budtender was very nice and he helped us choosing some good hash. The prices are very good and their products are top quality.
2,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"My favorite in Amsterdam.
Always some exotic strains on the menu and especially the hash menu is pretty unique. ‚Ä¶"
3,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Very friendly personal, good Weed,nice Atmosphere....‚ù§ see ya soon"
4,Coffeeshop Club Media, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"They have like an entrance with a locked door. It made us think they weren't open yet or something then some bloke comes out and says you have to buy something to be let in which I thought was weird as that's why we were there. Nice place, clean and tidy just a little strange way to treat customers."
5,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The storefront is rather uninviting, being a little hole in the wall with a barely visible sign. You order in a little room in front of the lounge, it's a bit dim and you can't easily see the flower. ‚Ä¶"

7,Coffeeshop Club Media, 1 star ,2 weeks ago,"The workers threatened us without a reason!
Not a place for tourists."
8,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,3 years ago,After roaming several days searching Amsterdam we stumbled upon Club Media. Very quiet shop where the budtender was extremely helpful and not pressuring. 2 Volcano vaporizers and an explanation sheet. We got Girl Scout Cookies and could not have been happier with the quality either. 5/5.
9,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great weed, quick service, but only Maestro"
10,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great quality, knowledgeable budtenders. A bit more on the pricey side, but it's still one of my favorites. I always go here for sleeping strains, and the quality is consistently good. ‚Ä¶"
11,Coffeeshop Club Media, 4 stars ,a year ago,Highly recommend the hash brownies and the champagne haze. The hash brownies are so so good from this place that I couldn‚Äôt bare to part with them before flying home..so I ate them all outside Schiphol hoping they would kick in during the ‚Ä¶
12,Coffeeshop Club Media, 1 star ,5 months ago,"They are unfriendly, rude and take advantage of the fact that you are a foreigner to talk about you in a rude way"
13,Coffeeshop Club Media, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The very good thing about this coffee shop is that it doesn't spell like crazy on the street, there are mainly locals in it and the atmosphere is quite cool.

14,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good quality, selection, price is worth it I'd say. The space cake are well made if that's your thing. The staff is friendly and professional. Also got a tea inside once, the place is clean and comfortable."
15,Coffeeshop Club Media, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"High quality weed, low prices.
4 stars because the first 2 times they let us in (night) and 1 time they don't (noon on a rainy day). OK you say 25 yo limit on the door but we are 24 and you have already let us in 2 times.... why not a third....??"
16,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Chilled, friendly. Great selection of products with very knowledgeable staff. Seems to be mainly locals, which is great. Plus they do an amazing hot chocomel - when you're baked, what more could you possibly need?"
17,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great quality product, never went into the lounge but picked up the half gram pure joints and were very good tasting and potent. Definitely organic and well grown cannabis!"
18,Coffeeshop Club Media, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice atmosphere inside, as well as amazing service. Good vibe. However the preroald joints had a bit to much tobacco for my taste. Another downside are some of the rules like taking of your head."
19,Coffeeshop Club Media, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I think the place is nice and beautiful and  in a good locality too.

I give 3 stars cuz, the guy who was selling me the cannabis scammed me for 50 cents but it's a small amount so it don't matter much.. But I clearly saw you hide my 50 cents."
20,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Such a place! It's big, comfortable, decent tunes and a menu that would make me go again even if I had to sit on a rusty nail! Coffee guy makes a mean brew and the smokables are üî•"
21,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,5 years ago,The best coffeeshop that I visited in Amsterdam the staff are friendly and helpful they answer your questions about their weed and they will let you smell the product and check it out like really have a look. The sitting area is very comfortable. I love this place and it's a must go for me every time I go to Amsterdam.
22,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of my favourite spots to smoke in Amsterdam. The place is very relaxed and the prices are fair (also close to a super market if you want some cheaper snacks)
23,Coffeeshop Club Media, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best coffeeshop in Amsterdam, the best menu, all i tried (tried pretty much all weed) was good and the best prices looking of the quality.
