0,Blauw, 5 stars ,a month ago,"So far the best indo place in Amsterdam. And one of my favorite restaurants in the cityü•∞
Couldn‚Äôt recommend it more! ‚Ä¶"
1,Blauw, 5 stars ,5 months ago,This is a great restaurant with lovely atmosphere and delicious food. We all had the meat rice table. It has a wide selection of food all great.
2,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"We were worried the Rice Platter would be too much food for 2 people but it was surprisingly manageable. We ordered the meat and fish combo. All of the meats were extremely tender and very well flavored. The shrimp dishes were great, but ‚Ä¶"
3,Blauw, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"I had the meat and fish rice table and my husband the veg one. The portions and foods were very very delicious. Since we like spicy foods, it was a full flavourful bomb in the mouth."
4,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,Amazing Indo food! A little expensive but it is totally worth it. They package it well when delivering it.
5,Blauw, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,This has been my all time favorite Indonesian restaurant for years. And although the food tastes really nice and authentic it‚Äôs not my go to place any longer after my recent visit. Simply because it has become overpriced. Having an ‚Ä¶
6,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"The food was exceptionally good, I really enjoyed it. The only negative I will say is that the flavour seemed more mild possibly for Dutch tastes and could have been more spicy/flavourful compared to what I have had in Indonesia. The portions were plentiful and the service was very quick"
7,Blauw, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"The best things were the fresh crunchy salad with a coconut oil dressing and the peanut sauce. I found much of the vegetarian menu fixe was deep-fried. For all the positive reviews here and elsewhere, I was underwhelmed by the quality and price. There are lots of other Indonesian places to try instead."
8,Blauw, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"We visited this place for dinner. Took a couple of vodka tonics, nicely presented and good measures. Ordered the tasting menu. They adapted it to account for us not eating red meat, which was nice. Starters were very good,  including ‚Ä¶"
9,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Every time we are in Amsterdam we make sure to eat here (but make a reservation!). Everything is delicious! I recommend either the ‚Äúrice table‚Äù which has a bunch of tiny flavorful dishes or the chef‚Äôs surprise 3 ‚Ä¶
10,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Excellent food, very tasty. Some flavor that I've rarely tasted before. Kind service. But be prepared to pay around 50euros per person for a starter a drink and a main dish (more expensive that I expected)"
11,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great dinner.  Our first time, the waiter explained our options.  Food was very tasty, spicy ( but not too hot).  Rijsttafel gabe a great variety of food to try.  It is A LOT of food!"
12,Blauw, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great rice table and very friendly and knowledgeable service. The wide variety of super tasty dishes is almost overwhelming and a pleasure to the eye and taste buds. Nice atmosphere and fair prices. Well recommended.
13,Blauw, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"I've visited and had a rice table with my wife twice now. The first time was fine, we were given a decent amount of attention and service. The second time, we didn't feel the love, which was made worse by being sat at a cramped table beside ‚Ä¶"
14,Blauw, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Food was really delicious. Even though the rice tables might be a lot for 2 people but if you want to try different stuff, just take one.
We tried the fish rice table and it was really good. We really enjoyed it with ‚Ä¶"
15,Blauw, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Amazing food, we ordered a set menu for two people and the portions were massive. It was very well presented and tasted delicious. Ther servers were wonderful,. The only drawback would be that the table was too small for the amount of food we ordered, but thats on us for being gluttons. 10/10."
16,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Must visit this Indonesian food. Ask for the rice platters. It's a variety of dishes.
17,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you want top of the line Indonesian food, this is the place to be!
Kind people and great atmosphere.
Try the rice table which is all sorts of foods combined. ‚Ä¶"
18,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We checked into our Airbnb today and had the most amazing variety of the tasting menu. One was meat-centric for me and the other, vegetarian for my wife. They fit us in downstairs at high top tables without a reservation which we thought ‚Ä¶"
19,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Absolutely fantastic.

Ordered the Rijsttafel Authentiek between 4 of us and the selection was great. ‚Ä¶"
20,Blauw, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"Very friendly waiter, knows how to host the guests. Was my first time trying an Indonesian restaurant and i am glad i did. Had a rice table with little dishes of meat, fish and vegetarian, they tasted really good. The wine menu was fine, not many options but i also wasn't expecting that. Would recommend."
21,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best dinners I've ever had. We ordered the rijsttafel and could not have been more pleased. Service was quick and attentive as well which contributed to the great atmosphere. Would recommend to anyone looking for interesting Dutch-Indonesian cuisine.
22,Blauw, 1 star ,4 months ago,Avoid this place if you are an international traveller! The owner/manager was rude and rejected our Covid passes (which are internationally accepted in letter form) because we didn‚Äôt have the Dutch QR. These have been accepted everywhere ‚Ä¶
23,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very nice food and helpful waiters. We try a tasting menu and select as really nice and vaired with lot of different dishes to be tried.
24,Blauw, 4 stars ,2 months ago,Good service. Was an 'experience' as they say...a smorgasbord of dishes...nothing particularly memorable but all together a fun feast for the eyes.
25,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Shanti was an excellent server. The whole staff was warm and friendly. They do offer Rijstaffel for a single person, but it is a lot of food. Great place to get your Indonesian fix if you're looking for it while visiting!"
26,Blauw, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A fine-dining experience with very friendly staff, amazing wine selection and good food.
Don't expect to pay any less than 30-40 euros minimum per person, but I would ‚Ä¶"
27,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Wonderfull Indonesian food...1st Class üëç
Espacially ""Rijsttafel"" is delicious..you can order ""Meat"" or ""Fish"" Rijsttafel..both very Tasty. The service is good and they make you feel very Welcome. ‚Ä¶"
28,Blauw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Our group of 6 were taken right to our reserved table. We went for the chefs rice table at 47.50 pp and it was a lot of food. They did a good job of offering gluten free to one of our group. Really one star off because the food felt like it ‚Ä¶
29,Blauw, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Always good. Nice set up. Rice table ‚Ç¨35 per person- quality very good. Great!
30,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,One of the best places to wat in Amsterdam. The meat rice table is amazing and the also the starters are great! Might be busy so make sure you reserve on time
31,Blauw, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Had a very bad experience, racist staff treating us, Black woman and Brown man, very cold and bad while being nice and friendly to white guests on the neighbouring tables. Never again and would not recommend."
32,Blauw, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, make sure to try them all! We went there with 3 of us and had an amazing time. Make sure you book in advance!"
33,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing experience!!! The versatile crafts of the chef titi qnd her crew are just incredible. Thank you so much for the whole staff of blauw for making an incredible and memorable experience. 10 points, keep up the good work.
Will most def come back and recommend everyone this place."
34,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food, amazing quality, staff were very polite and helpful.

Would highly recommend this restaurant if you were after some great indonesian food!"
35,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We have tried both Meat and Fish Rijsttafels. Both of them were delicious. It's a nice experience to try. Stuff was really friendly and helpful.
36,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,There was a lot of traffic and we were 30 minutes late for my reservation.   They were able to fit us in anyway.  Awesome customer service and good food (rice table).
37,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Contemporary Indonesian restaurant. Modern interior design. We had a taster of Indonesian streetfood which was very interesting. Especially the springroll (who would have thought so) was amazing. We shared the meat and the fish rijsttafel. ‚Ä¶
38,Blauw, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Amazing resturant specialized in Indonesian cousine. Must try the Rijsttafel, a tapas-like option where your table gets covered in little tasting plates of the most popular items on the menu. Service is not the greatest and that is the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars."
39,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Service was great (even though I was with a variety of people who had special requests). Food was excellent
40,Blauw, 1 star ,a year ago,"Timing is off! Normally loved for its delicious food and friendly service my Christmas Eve is off to the worst start. Reserved dinner for two for 18.00 pick up time. Still in line (80 min and counting) , in the cold and no estimated time ‚Ä¶"
41,Blauw, 4 stars ,9 months ago,"We are familiar with rijstafel, but it was the first time we tried Blauw.
We ordered the complete rijstafel, which was really good in quality and quantity. The only cons were that despite listing it on the menu description, it came ‚Ä¶"
42,Blauw, 5 stars ,a month ago,First time online order from Blauw... wow there food is amazing!
43,Blauw, 5 stars ,6 months ago,It was everything Id hoped it would be. Seriously every single dish in our order was amazing.
44,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The Indonesian food here is fantastic. Be sure to have the cinnamon cake for dessert with tea.
45,Blauw, 4 stars ,a year ago,"I am a southeast asian living in Amsterdam and i have been going around to try the various Indonesian restaurants. Restaurant Blauw did not disappoint me. Food taste authentic & spicy enough, service was good, nice ambience, good location ‚Ä¶"
46,Blauw, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We had a delicious dinner at Blauw Amsterdam. We had the Rice Table banquet, which was huge. Every single dish was tasty - though we particularly liked the chicken satay and the spicy prawns. I am a coeliac and the kitchen had no trouble at all with gluten free options, which was great! Lovely service too."
47,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very nice. Immensely enjoyed the greate tasting Indonesian food.
48,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This restaurant is a bit far out a ‚Ç¨20 taxi ride, but worth it. We had the least expensive rijsttafel for three. The variety and quality of the dishes was very good indeed. The atmosphere in the restaurant is welcoming and the staff were ‚Ä¶"
49,Blauw, 5 stars ,6 months ago,By far the best Indonesian food I had in Amsterdam. Staff is very friendly and super attentive.
50,Blauw, 5 stars ,a year ago,We had the meat rijstafel and were impressed by the diversity and number of dishes which were ALL delicious. Quantity is more than enough. We also started with the rempah gin cocktail wich was fresh and spicy. Our first Indonesian restaurant but can highly recommend.
51,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing vegetarian rijsttafel and amazing service. I greatly enjoyed my first rijsttafel experience!
52,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Friendly staff, good wine, incredible food! Allergens clearly labelled. We had the 4 types of street food starter (to share) and I had the chicken/ginger/soy. Good selection of accompanying sides. Fair price."
53,Blauw, 4 stars ,a year ago,"We just had the Ron Blauw at Home Rijst Tafel menu for our anniversary dinner. The food was wonderful, the directions clear for preparation and the Spotify playlist was perfect. The only surprise was the poor quality packaging it arrived ‚Ä¶"
54,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing restaurant offering amazing Indonesian food. It was my first ( but not last) dinner there! We booked this restaurant with my colleagues and ordered the menu which is composed of starters, mains dishes to share and dessert. It is ‚Ä¶"
55,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Deliciously spicy indonesian fare served family style. Plenty of food, a myriad delicacies, authentic flavoring, busy, casual place, friendly service. Great wine list. Recommended. Fair prices. Won¬¥t go wrong."
56,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We had the rijsttafel for two people, and it was incredible. Every single dish was delicious. We booked at the last minute, and were told that they would need the table back by 7:30 - but at no point did we feel rushed.
Absolutely fantastic, would definitely visit again if I was nearby."
57,Blauw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Tasty food and overall feel of the restaurant is welcoming. Service was a little disappointing as we were not attended to for some time when we arrived and additionally as the appetizers were not explained/explained wrongly as I had a ‚Ä¶
58,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent as per usual. It's an absolute food feast here. Lovely setting and a great dining experience.
Not sure about previous commenters saying they left hungry. I was still full ‚Ä¶"
59,Blauw, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Food was good. We got the Rijsttafel mixed with meat/fish for two people. Meat dishes were better than the fish, and the veg options were more mild in flavour. Expensive given you can't seem to share mains. ‚Ä¶"
60,Blauw, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food I must admit, I didn't like the fact that we couldn't share a meal. If you order one main you get charged double if you eat together. I'm not a big eater at all so I don't bother ordering a main for myself. I did spend 30eu+ on ‚Ä¶"
61,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food is very good and seems original. But be warned that it is spicy. The variety of food is amazing but everything is well prepared. The serving is very profesional and prompt. They advise in wine choice and they know what they are ‚Ä¶
62,Blauw, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Eating here was an adventure all on its own. A bit pricier than I expected, but really tasty. The location was also a bit out of the way and seemed more local-ish. ‚Ä¶"
63,Blauw, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Perfect example how to go downhill. Nice reviews, difficult to book place. When we arrived we were informed we have only 1h45m to eat. Appetizers arrived after around 45 min. Food arrived after next 45m. And it was relatively disappointing. ‚Ä¶"
64,Blauw, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Husband and I had brisket and beef BBQ ribs. Both were very tasty, though portions were a little small for the price. Coleslaw, corn bread and fries were also good. Service was prompt and friendly. Would eat there again."
65,Blauw, 2 stars ,2 years ago,Great service and ambience but the food was not very good at all. Tried about 20 different dishes in one of their platters with 3 others and hardly liked 3 of them.  Very expensive given the nearby alternatives.  Hard to get a table. Not worth the bother.
66,Blauw, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great place to eat. Don't eat for 2 days, then order a rickstaffel(or whatever it's called) and you get about 15 small bowls of the tastiest Indonesian dishes. Gets busy so best to book a table."
67,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We loved it. The owner unlocked the door & made a reservation for us. It was worth the 1/2 hour wait until they opened. Staff friendly & helpful. Food was excellent. Will come back on our next trip out from Seattle Washington, USA."
68,Blauw, 1 star ,3 years ago,An awaited night out with an old friend totally spoilt by a cheeky waitress who was trained to explain the great Indonesian tradition of sharing rice plates which coming from Spain is nothing new to us where we share tapas. We decided to ‚Ä¶
69,Blauw, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Don‚Äôt bother!  It was uncomfortably hot, we were made to wait a long time to be even greeted after being seated (we had a reservation), we were charged for ‚Äúmineral water‚Äù which was lukewarm tap water poured into a glass bottle with the ‚Ä¶"
70,Blauw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The place doesn't look very inviting from the outside but is highly recommended, (at least for tourists) and the food actually really good, the staff show dedication to learn about their menu, wines, and give great customer service, we ‚Ä¶"
71,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Exquisite dishes, warm welcomed and a place to come back to recreate a tasteful nostalgia."
72,Blauw, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"This was the first Indonesian restaurant I visited many years ago on a business trip, and remembered it well enough to bring my guests myself. Tried the ""table"" version which includes small bites of different dishes - which is really great for sharing. Lovely ambience!"
73,Blauw, 1 star ,5 years ago,"Highly over rated and over priced for the quality of food served.

Customer service lacks sincerity and effort to please, not to mention extremely ‚Ä¶"
74,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"If you love Indonesian cuisine than this is your place, the staff is attentive and good in their knowledge about the dishes they serve. My suggestion; definitely go for the rice table. The spices are just right and me as a meat and fish easter was not missing out on it when I went for the vegetarian option."
75,Blauw, 5 stars ,5 years ago,Hands down best Indonesian I've had in Amsterdam. Also went with a friend who'd never had Indonesian before and turns out had coconut and nut allergies -- a difficult position to be in considering that's the basis of almost all Indonesian ‚Ä¶
76,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great Indonesian food. Delicious
77,Blauw, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Service was slow but the food made up for it! It was worth waiting for. Not impressed with the service though, it was not as relaxing as it should‚Äôve been, we had to ask for the menus when we were seated, then the food took considerably ‚Ä¶"
78,Blauw, 5 stars ,9 months ago,"Like Grandmother‚Äôs Kitchen , no a lot of really good Indonesian food in Amsterdam, Taste and Service very Good"
79,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I ate the best chicken in my life here. I had to wait like 5-10 minutes, maybe I had that impression that it was a long time or I am used to quick meal places, but after I received my portion I was in heaven. Thank you so much for this wonderful time for my palate."
80,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing Indonesian food, really nice ambience and great service. The veggie rice table was very well portioned. We had a great time!"
81,Blauw, 1 star ,3 years ago,"It is not a big deal when our order was taken wrongly. But when the food was served, there were literally 5 pieces of shrimp in the plate. And it was 28 euros. ‚Ä¶"
82,Blauw, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Delicious Indonesian food!  This was a nice setting to explore a new cuisine.   The waitstaff were welcoming and helpful in explaining the various foods we got to try.  Great experience!
83,Blauw, 2 stars ,6 years ago,"The only good thing about this restaurant is their Service. Very Welcoming and nice staff. However, the food was way below my expectations. The value and quality of the food does not meet the price. The taste was not to my preference and that is my personal opinion. This restaurant is way overrated."
84,Blauw, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Ok, so the food is good. However, despite the fact that we had made reservations and ordered very quickly, we were waiting over an hour for our food (just two of us). Our waitress also forgot our drink orders twice. The second time she said ‚Ä¶"
85,Blauw, 1 star ,2 years ago,"As a Group of 8 without reservation we were given the cards, ordered drinks and where then told that we could only order expensive menus. The owner insisted on ordering those or leaving.  We left."
86,Blauw, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Incredible meal, fantastic service. Would recommend to anyone, but especially if it is your first time trying Indonesian food."
87,Blauw, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Disclaimer: I'm an Indonesian

Blauw doesn't disappoint. Although the interior, decor and the staff are all ‚Ä¶"
88,Blauw, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"I had a very bad experience and don't plan to come back. The staff was friendly, the problem was the food. It tasted like the rice and some smaller dishes were prepared for quite some time and warmed in the microwave. The price-quality ratio is quite high for the food that was served."
89,Blauw, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Bustling place, we didn't have a reservation but were lucky someone had just cancelled (this was a Saturday night). Orders the mixed rijsttafel for 2 which was huge and very well prepared. No room for desert. Bill came to roughly 100 euro including wine and coffee."
90,Blauw, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Delicious food. Friendly, but not terribly attentive service. A really well balanced spice level and wide range of tastes makes this a worthwhile stop on your adventures in Amsterdam."
91,Blauw, 1 star ,4 years ago,"The food was fine but Blauw has the worst service I've had in Amsterdam. Waiter forgot to put in our food order and had to ask us to repeat it 30 minutes later. Refused to give us tap water after this happened and gave an attitude the rest of the night. Not worth going back, many other great restaurants in the area."
92,Blauw, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Good food, terrible management and customer service.  A friend of mine had booked a night out for a large group of us moms.  Up to the day before we had a large number in our reservation, and this was confirmed with the management, although ‚Ä¶"
93,Blauw, 3 stars ,7 years ago,Food is good and tasted authentic. Service is not very attentive and not very warm. It took a long time to get even a menu. I would say ok but design and style do not make up for the service. While the  food was good I can also find  such quality at another one or two venues.
94,Blauw, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"A different kind of Indonesian restaurant I was used to. More modern and with great service,  but still with traditional food. The best way to enjoy Blauw is by ordering one of the rice tables. Delicious!"
95,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious modern Indonesian food with a very good drinks selection to boot. Modern decor - do not expect a traditional feel to the place. Service was very good.
96,Blauw, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Awsome taste and presentation of food. This is for me, one of the best restaurants in Amsterdam. The attendants are cordial.
The space and seating is very limited, so please book before hand, by call or online."
97,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Had never tried authentic Indonesian cuisine before. Was fantastic. Staff couldn't of been any more friendly and we're helpful on recommending good local bars
98,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I like to have a rijsttafel every time I'm in Amsterdam and this has been the best yet. Lots of different flavours and textures and the meats beautifully cooled.
99,Blauw, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Expensive, but it is the best Indonesian food I have ever had, period. Almost every dish I had was the best variant across its competitors. ‚Ä¶"
100,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,An excellent experience and delicious meal. Shared the Vegetable and Seafood meal for 2 pax and was not disappointed. ‚Ä¶
101,Blauw, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Food was acceptable & service was great. The Risolas are worth a visit. The only  glitch being they dont serve a 100% veg rijsttafel even when you ask for a Veg. version - where Veg. -> No meat, no fish . Moreover, the sambal paste on one of the dishes definitely contained fish even though the menu claims it does not."
102,Blauw, 1 star ,7 years ago,"this place is / at least was, when i went there, some kind of f**king joke. a friend of mine got burnt, quite badlly, by the in-table food heating setup. restaurant staff responded amazingly with comments like 'i get burnt here all the ‚Ä¶"
103,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Wow at Blauw! Recommended by very good friends who live in Amsterdam. We took taxi there and back from downtown, 20 minutes each way, but worth it. Best Indonesian food I have tasted in a long long time. The sea bream was spectacular. The ‚Ä¶"
104,Blauw, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"The food was good. However, I took a friend and my partner out for dinner. There was a horrible sewer smell in the restaurant that would come and go. Several people complained but nothing was done. I won't go back - for the price we paid we should be able to eat free of sewer smells."
105,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Crazy Indonesian food. Affordable and delicious.

Reservation is highly recommended. ‚Ä¶"
106,Blauw, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"the food was tasted good but I felt let down for the price you pay the portions were disappointing. At 30 p.p. for a rijsttafel for two, and then you receive two small skewers of satay per person?"
107,Blauw, 1 star ,2 years ago,"For how much this place was recommended, the service destroyed the experience. We were checked on zero times, requested a dessert without nuts and was then served pistachios. The food itself was average."
108,Blauw, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Ugh.. tourist rip off spot with more effort spent on dishware, staff who have to spend time explaining the unnecessarily  convaluted menu and frills than the food ..outrageous price as a result.  There's a BBQ shack 2 min away that has superb food and value."
109,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favourite Indonesian in town. Reistafel is great. Can be super spicy but that is part of the fun.
You can buy their home-made sambals and take them home with you!"
110,Blauw, 1 star ,2 years ago,"We walked in a group of eight and after we ordered drinks, we were told we can only have 4 most expensive items from the entire menu. So we just walked out. Tourist trap! Worst experience in Amsterdam so far"
111,Blauw, 2 stars ,8 years ago,"I was on vacation and I already had seen so good critics, so I went with my family and we didn't liked. The rice table was bad, because it was strange flavours. ‚Ä¶"
112,Blauw, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Blauw is by far the best Indonesian restaurant that we have dined in Amsterdam. I recommend to get one of their signature Rijstafels to get a taste of variety of Indonesian dishes. Try to get a table on the ground floor, as the athmosphere is so much better."
113,Blauw, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Absolutely delightful and delicious food. Go for the famous rice platter and have the recommended red wine. You'll be cropful of excellent food for under 40 Euros
114,Blauw, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Nice employees, food well prepared and presented but tastes very poor and disappointing"
115,Blauw, 2 stars ,5 years ago,We have waited more than 1 hour for our food to come and the restaurant was empty when we came. Also at the end they charged us 7 beers instead of 3. Everything is incredible slow and food was not out of ordinary.
116,Blauw, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Blauw has tasty Indonesian food. Select the rice tafel to try the best of all their dishes and share with friends. There's 3 choices of rice tafels: fish, meat or vegetarian rice tafels. Most of the dishes vary between medium and very spicy ‚Ä¶"
117,Blauw, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I really enjoyed the food
118,Blauw, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"What a great food experience! We had the meat, fish and vegetables meals and it was simply exquisite. Every single dish was just delicious. One of the best restaurant I know."
119,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,What a feast! Incredible new flavors that I‚Äôve never had the fortune of tasting - until now. Worth the hype. Enjoy it!
120,Blauw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Food was great even it was not very clear how to order them at first (the shared dishes). Maybe i will order those single dishes instead next time if i ever go back again.
121,Blauw, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"a bit disappointing - had the rice tafel - was not hot (warm) nor spicy enough, not fresh, but probably warmed-up (food arrived 5min after ordering). Prefer the Ron Oriental in Ouderkerk."
122,Blauw, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"We were lucky enough to get in here with no reservation.  We all ordered variations of the rice table, meat, fish, and vegi.  We had a feast on hordes of different dishes.  It was wonderful."
123,Blauw, 5 stars ,8 years ago,"Simply amazing Selera Blauw (Rice Table)! Ordered the complete meat, fish and vegetables and every dish was fantastic.The Oedang Ketjap (stir fried shrimps with a sauce of coconut and pandan) was equally fantastic. Highly recommend|!"
124,Blauw, 5 stars ,a year ago,Very polite staff and large amount of food served in a very authentic way. You have to try their Blauw 7 Renpah gin-tonic!
125,Blauw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Took our out of town friends here and had a nice dinner. Not the best I‚Äôve ever had but still delicious!
126,Blauw, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Fabulous meal. So much amazing food served by helpful friendly staff.  Really a buzzing atmosphere too. Will go back for sure.
127,Blauw, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"holy god you will get a ton of food here if you order the rice table.  They have a great assortment of food and the staff is very helpful.  Plenty of vegetarian, pescitarian, and omnivore options."
128,Blauw, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Worth only 2 stars. The food seems to be cooked for many and just put in the plates after ordering. No touch of anything special at all. Very expensive for such food.
129,Blauw, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very tasty food even if noisy place. We enjoyed a lot the rijtafel authentiek, 35‚Ç¨*2 persons, or 70‚Ç¨. Enjoy üòÉ"
130,Blauw, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely fantastic meal. Food was stunning. Really well cooked and right proportions too. Service was ok.
131,Blauw, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great Indonesian food and a popular restaurant on a Saturday evening. We were lucky to walk in and find a table. Prices are ok, but not cheap."
