0,Big Shots, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Amazing cafe. I went there during the day it was free. But at night they were charging an entry fees of 15‚Ç¨ as it got very busy. The beer was good. The staff was amazing. Could be a little more attentive tho.
1,Big Shots, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My friend recommended me this place and it was my second time there.
Love stuff and the food. The music is fun."
2,Big Shots, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Super chillin for party or relax you can enjoy without limits with respect, thannx you for to be nice üòä"
3,Big Shots, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Quiet place, good staff, to expensive alcohol, you can watch live sports there"
4,Big Shots, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great bar with music and food. Nice seating area and great selection of drinks. As for the food some of the nicest you'll have.
5,Big Shots, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Free WiFi. The food is delicious. The prices were affordable. I ate here two days in the row. I ate dinner one night and breakfast the next. The music is great and the atmosphere is nice. The place is small, but it's makes up in quality and family culture. The workers embrace you like family."
6,Big Shots, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"The owner it's duper friendly, in the mood to help you with your trouble if you have one like in our case..... You can smoke and drink... Also charge your phone. Danke!!!!"
7,Big Shots, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Came here two times during my 3 day stay! Super nice staff and decent comfort food. You're allowed to smoke inside the bar which is also nice if you're into that, if not, probably not the place for you because there is always at least one person smoking. Good music and lots of TV's"
8,Big Shots, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Loved this place! To bad it closes at 12pm
9,Big Shots, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very cozy and cool place for drinks, smoke and snacks üòÅ"
10,Big Shots, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"A little sports bar near the train station that allows smoking indoors. The beer is cheap and the 4 TVs ensure you have a view of the game no matter where you're sat. Friendly staff and tasty bitteballs make for a decent short stay, but eventually the smoke got too much for me and I left."
11,Big Shots, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice vibrant place you can order food, drink alcohol and smoke your weed here. My 5 star rating is based on getting my mother in law to roll her own fat one and spark up!..Nan on Fireüî•üëµüí®üòë"
12,Big Shots, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Don't go for the food, service, our cheep drinks. Looked like a good little place with good electronic music. Ordered the burger and fries with a pint. The draft beer was warm and the burger came out with nothing but a bun and didn't taste like real meat. Staff looks bored and pissed off."
13,Big Shots, 1 star ,4 years ago,"I have no idea how this place has a 4 rating. By the pictures, it's possible that it's under new ownership.  Anyhow,  Stupid me ordered a medium rare tbone steak (25 euros) . The fries were good. I could tell the steak was defrosted in a ‚Ä¶"
14,Big Shots, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really nice bar quite small and difficult to get around if it's really full but keep going back because the staff are welcoming and it's also a good place to smoke weed and relax.
15,Big Shots, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"At this place a few times with for my son's 21st, nice relaxed bar, mix set of tunes on and football on (just ask) weed and a pint no probs, daytime and evening a nice wee crowd in, Will also provide a grinder, and because it was 5 Mins ‚Ä¶"

18,Big Shots, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"In Amsterdam's Red Light District, you will get pushed into bars all over the place promising you great food and drinks.  Big Shots is just a sports bar in the center of everything.  Their drinks are fine but they do allow smoking inside ‚Ä¶"
