1,Meghna, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Already 6 years in a row, every year on our anniversary on the 23rd of June we come here for dinner! Great food and service as always! Great value (and volume) for money, it's sooo much delicious food!"

7,Meghna, 1 star ,2 years ago,This place is definitely a bad choice to have Indian food. The quantity of the food is less with its over priced menu. The waiter and the manager didn‚Äôt treat us good. They just take your plate as soon as you complete without even asking your permission. Please look for other Indian restaurants.
8,Meghna, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Lovely little restaurant in Amsterdam. Had a range of curries including familiar ones and others. We finished all of our food and it was delicious. Waiters were friendly and the atmosphere was good.
9,Meghna, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice restaurant. Food is average and prices are a bit high but it is expected since its an Indian restaurant. Seats are very limited, the place is congested but i have no problem to go back there. I tried the king prawns with coconut cream, it was good üëçüèª"
10,Meghna, 1 star ,2 years ago,"If you are an Indian, please don't go to this place. Its just a waste of time and money as per the food.
