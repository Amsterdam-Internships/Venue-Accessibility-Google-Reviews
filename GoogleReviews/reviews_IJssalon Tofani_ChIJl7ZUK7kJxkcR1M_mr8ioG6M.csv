9,IJssalon Tofani, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Excellent quality ice cream shop that has been going since 1942. Better try this one in favor of the tourist trap Nutella and wafel shops further on the Nieuwmarkt. I had an espresso with a scoop of pistache cream ‚òïüç®üëåüèª

17,IJssalon Tofani, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best Italian ice cream in Amsterdam so far. The ""nocciola"" (hazelnut) is pretty good and the chocolate as well of pistacchio.
