0,Kobalt, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Nice bar. Comfortably furnished, unfortunately very noisy. Service was very friendly and the beer on tap was made quickly. Prices for drinks absolutely fine."
1,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 weeks ago,"The staff friendliness, the whole atmosphere of the bar, the drinks, the location, the lazy cat floating around... all the elements to make a successful bar! Totally love this place :)"
2,Kobalt, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Certainly a nice caf√© for a drink. Don't order food. The meal salad is overpriced (14,50 for a few green leaves and some goat cheese). They forgot to add a few things which were advertised in the menu but didn't bother when I brought it to ‚Ä¶"
3,Kobalt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good Beers, also from tap. Very good Bitterballen. Small and crowded locations. Service very friendly and fast. Recommendation."
4,Kobalt, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Great place to enjoy a drink on the terrace.
Beautiful view on the canal"
5,Kobalt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very warm and comfortable ambiance for eating for enjoying a nice warm beverage. Very close to Amsterdam Central train station, we ate dinner here while waiting for a canal cruise (most cruises and ships leave from this general area in ‚Ä¶"
6,Kobalt, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Very delicious French toast I highly recommend this:)
‚ÄúThe sandwich‚Äù was fine"
7,Kobalt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Good food and nice place to people watch. They had a great burger and the hot chocolate milk was delicious. House car also added to the charm
8,Kobalt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very nice and surprisingly cheap caf√© next to the canal. Attentive waiters (but there are a lot of table, so it can still sometimes take a while) and the food was amazing (I had the Reuben sandwich)"
9,Kobalt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Cool spot!  Sidewalk raised picnic bench seating.  Big menu, but only available at peak hours, except for a few snacky things.
Check it out, it's a nice quiet spot."
10,Kobalt, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Friendly. Roomy. Nice. Staff is on top of their game. Also a nice and changing selection of beers, cocktails and food."
11,Kobalt, 3 stars ,3 months ago,"Steak too hard to cut or chew. Shoud have been smashed or rested to be soft, but wasn't."
12,Kobalt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely amazing breakfast and coffee, i wish I had time to go again. Decent prices, too."
13,Kobalt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Nice coffee served by friendly staff. Sitting outside is not so nice because of the incessant traffic. Inside looks interesting and cosy though.
14,Kobalt, 4 stars ,7 months ago,The scrambled egg and the latte macchiato were really good and worth the price. The French toast is overpriced(2 small French toasts coast 7.50‚Ç¨). The services was nice and fast.
15,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great lunch stop.  Strong beer list
16,Kobalt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome service! Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Excellent choices and amazing food! Must go when in Amsterdam. In the heart of the city."
17,Kobalt, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Location is nice. Friendly service. Price is expensive, but hey it's in the Amsterdam center. So I can't complain about the price."
18,Kobalt, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Friendly staff, nice location very near the station."
19,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really relaxed atmosphere. The food is well made and tasty and there is a good selection of drinks. I liked the cubes on each table with the drinks menu on, as well as being a novelty which appeals to me, it's quite a useful detail because the wind isn't going to be blowing away a 4"" by 4"" cube of wood. We ate there twice."
20,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"really liked the vibe in here, prices very reasonable and staff were very polite and friendly. Spoke excellent English, putting us to shame for our limited Dutch. ‚Ä¶"
21,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Stopped in for a beer and a snack before turning in for the evening. Service was quick, the beer was cold, and the snacks were good. ‚Ä¶"

23,Kobalt, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very friendly staff and very reasonably priced

25,Kobalt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"üëçüèºNice cafe, little noisy because of the main road junction."
26,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This cafe is close to the station and open all day and evening til late. Great for hot and cold drinks, breakfast, lunch and also for evening drinks and food (lighter options). We had eggs with salmon and toast, tea and coffee one morning ‚Ä¶"
27,Kobalt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We went here on a Thursday afternoon with our laptops. The place was crowded and we found a not so comfortable spot. After our first drink we moved tables and luckily for us, it was the best spot. Worked there for 4+ hours and finished with a beer. Great place, the busyness didn't bother us."
28,Kobalt, 3 stars ,3 years ago,Nice local brown bar. A few craft beers in the selection. Interior decor didn't impress.
29,Kobalt, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Walked in around lunch time. Venue was mostly empty. Server was sitting with a mouthful of fries and asked how large our group was. We replied ""Ten"", she shrugged and said ""We don't have room"". ‚Ä¶"
30,Kobalt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place to stop for a beer and snack near Centraal station before heading back to the airport. There are lots of rubbish places around here so this is a gem in this very touristy area. Chilled atmosphere, wooden tables like an English country pub and not extortionate prices."
31,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great Atmosphere. Good choice of drinks and food. Very Amsterdam.
32,Kobalt, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Comfortable place, with a few locals. However the staff isn't great. Even with some experience with Dutch service this was pretty extreme. It took them 40+ minutes to make a bruschetta, and 2 burgers and the place wasn't more than 1/3 full ‚Ä¶"
33,Kobalt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,I‚Äôve only been here for ever but drinks but they also have a breakfast menu. It‚Äôs a cozy cafe although service can be hard to come by depending on the time of night. It‚Äôs not the place to end your night as they wrap things up earlier than ‚Ä¶
34,Kobalt, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I had the savory pancake, and the combination of cheese, spinach, honey, and walnuts was perfect! The atmosphere is relaxed, and the caf√©'s interior is beautiful! Staff is very friendly and attentive."
35,Kobalt, 1 star ,2 years ago,I used to come here all the time. I even organized events here. Today they charged me for tap water with my beer. I'm never coming back. EDIT: The owner below gives an explanation for why they charge. If this explanation had been given when ‚Ä¶
36,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice coffee with fast, friendly conditions"
37,Kobalt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I loved this cafe! It was close to my hotel which is how I found it. But I had lunch, breakfast, and dinner here and it was great  each time! The ravioli for dinner was scrumptious. The bacon(more deli ham), scrambled eggs, and toast was ‚Ä¶"
38,Kobalt, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Service takes long, but the girls working are nice. Food was not bad but not amazing either."
39,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place with a simple but good menu. Service was outstanding, they had only 2 servers on and there was a full dining room plus patio across the street, yes across the street and those 2 girls managed it very well."
40,Kobalt, 3 stars ,7 years ago,"This place is great if you have to kill time, located just a two minute walk away from the Central Station. The place is has a bit of a business vibe to it as there are alot of people meeting up here for that. ‚Ä¶"

42,Kobalt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Excellent food and atmosphere
43,Kobalt, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Typical Amsterdam cafe. Service is fine, not super chipper but mildly friendly. Which is way better than most Dutch cafes. Decent menu and stellar pies"

45,Kobalt, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice place for meeting and chatting, though a bit too noisy if you need a corner to do some work. Friendly staff, a place with an overall informal and casuall look and feel!"
46,Kobalt, 3 stars ,3 years ago,You can get good food here and theres an extensive beer selection. Downpoint is the toilet which was very dark and the stairs to it is very steep. Be careful if youve had one of those Belgium beers !
47,Kobalt, 4 stars ,8 months ago,Good service - good beers - good food (im a local)
48,Kobalt, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing food and fast service, however the restaurant was a bit busy and loud in the evening. Still, I enjoyed it :) also, there is a cat inside :)"

We are visiting Amsterdam for the first time and wanted good coffee‚Äã. The coffee here blew us away! Really, really.good!"

51,Kobalt, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"I had some time to kill and this was a good place - many tables have power outlets, plus it is cheaper than I would expect for the area, so staying longer isn't an issue. The slowness of service some people mentioned here also helps it :D ‚Ä¶"
52,Kobalt, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Relaxed, good range of interesting and tasty food and drinks, sun-facing street seating, fab for watching the world go by for an hour or so. Friendly staff. Service unhurried, in a pleasant way! Not expensive."
53,Kobalt, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I don't often go out to cafes but when I do in the neighborhood, Cobalt is certainly worth going to. Located in a 'double' 17th century warehouse behind a typical Amsterdam canal house facade, the interior is warm, cozy and friendly. It's ‚Ä¶"

56,Kobalt, 5 stars ,a year ago,Seriously good food and friendly service
57,Kobalt, 4 stars ,6 years ago,"Perfect place for a lazy Sunday, with live jazz during winter and some nice snacks like garlic marinated mushrooms. A pro is that they have a mobile app where you can preorder and pay via PayPal. Occasionally drinks are forgotten and you have to wait longer though."
58,Kobalt, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"My food was rather nice, didn't blow me away but it was tasty. Music is indeed good and the place is cosy. Lots of cyclists going by."

63,Kobalt, 3 stars ,6 years ago,"It can get quite busy in the after work days, like fridays. Very well located next to Centraal, the staff it not too friendly (caused also by the lots of customers they have). Their snacks are ok, nothing fancy."
64,Kobalt, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great atmosphere, great service, and the best nachos in town! We went here twice during our trip!"
65,Kobalt, 2 stars ,5 years ago,"Food arrived after long wait, starter was good, main course was cassoulet with undercooked beans. We were surrounded by people pushing against us during the main course. Dont eat here on friday evenings!"
