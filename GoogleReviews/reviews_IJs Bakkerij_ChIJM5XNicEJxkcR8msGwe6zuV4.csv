1,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,"I wish I had read the reviews prior. The one time I donâ€™t, I end up in this horrible place. Just as others have stated: WAY OVERPRICED (hence no prices posted) and NOT fresh. Looks can be deceiving. We bought chocolate covered strawberries â€¦"
2,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,6 months ago,Scam Shop. They have no prices shown and for the same cakes they charge double as other stores.
3,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,I waited 20 minutes for a crepe that he told me would take max 5 minutes. It was so crunchy I felt like I was eating nachos so I asked for my money back and he refused. This was the crappiest crepe Iâ€™ve ever eaten and the worst service Iâ€™ve â€¦
4,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,Stopped by for dessert; sign in window said fresh waffles and crepes. I ordered one waffle with chocolate than watched the guy take a waffle that was sitting in case; put it in microwave(!) and then covered it in cold chocolate syrup. The â€¦
5,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,3 years ago,Do not buy from here over priced and food hygiene is really bad.
6,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,Would rate 0 stars if I could. Bought a (stale) eclair which had no price displayed. It was very obvious she made a price up on the spot. â‚¬5?! I wish I read these reviews beforehand
7,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,4 years ago,If you are there you might want to ask for the prices as they are not displayed. You may come to the conclusion that the products are overpriced. The Brownie I had was absolutely not worth 7â‚¬.
8,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,3 years ago,"The worst shop in Amsterdam, donâ€™t buy anything! We bought cookies and seller deceived us with price! Than she said that cookies cost 18 ðŸ’¶, that why we have bill with 18 ðŸ’¶, but itâ€™s impossible, in all shops in Amsterdam the maximum price of the same cookies is 7 ðŸ’¶!"
9,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,Paid 26euro for a piece of cake and a waffle. Totally ripping off tourists. i wonder how can this shop exist in Amsterdam
10,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,horrible! extremely overpriced and not fresh at all. very disappointed in the quality of the baked goods especially as the prices were astronomical. TOURIST TRAP
11,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Stale and absolutely horrible cakes! The rest of the products are old as well. Even the soda cans are near the expiration date.
This place should be shut down."
12,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,4 years ago,Do not go here. They used my credit card taking advantage of the fact that I did not need to put the pin code in and charged me 3 times by claiming that it didn't go through.
13,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,15â‚¬ for a space cake that didnt do anything to me and my girl. Not coming back
14,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,15â‚¬ for a space brownie (and a strong one) and nothing. Avoid this shop.

16,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,2 years ago,"No prices, overpriced, average much better else where"
17,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Few cheap prices written and then a lot not you take one and then yours is 17â‚¬ for ONE WAFFLE!

18,IJs Bakkerij, 1 star ,4 years ago,Avoid this place! The prices are hidden and as a tourist they will most likely overcharge you - a lot!
19,IJs Bakkerij, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Had a late night snack of fruit tart and excellent latte
