0,Hans en Grietje, 1 star ,3 months ago,"The salad I ordered was 15,50€, and it was the worst salad on the planet. Also i think the menu said 12,50€. It was supposed to be a chicken salad, but there was some kind of cutlery on top of it. The waitresses were nice."

21,Hans en Grietje, 1 star ,9 months ago,"Good service, good beers. Terrible follow up on promotions. Was promised a cap from Duvel if 2 duvels purshased but they lied to us and didn't take the advertisement off.

42,Hans en Grietje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Lovely little cosy bar with friendly, efficient service and solid food. The pea soup and club sandwich were great. Old cheese sandwich also good. The only negative thing I can say is that the bonus side salad (included for ‘free’) wasn’t great."
43,Hans en Grietje, 1 star ,3 years ago,i think people who enjoyed this place have very low standards for food. I can't explain the great ratings. The food was horrific! i ordered the burger... was cold and i think the chef was having a bad day.... because was tasteless as well.  if you are reading this: you can do better in Amsterdam!
44,Hans en Grietje, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"4.2? More like 2.0. The soup was ok. So were the fries. My Wiener Schnitzel was small and over fried. Utterly inedible. My wife got a much bigger portion, which was mostly cartilage. 16 euros, for what exactly? Coke was watered down. Tourist Trap Alert."

59,Hans en Grietje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I really enjoy coming to Hans & Grietje for a nice bowl of onion soup or tomato soup on a cold and rainy day.  And let's face it, in Amsterdam that's a big portion of the year.  Good beer selection too with Belgian and Dutch brews. There's …"
60,Hans en Grietje, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Close to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum, and situated at a nice spot along a picturesque canal, this place is popular with tourists and locals alike.  It's a pub that operates much like a fast food restaurant. You don't come here …"
61,Hans en Grietje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Surprisingly good value. This close to the Rijksmuseum, one expects inflated prices and indifferent food and service. Yet this very well-situated café offers large portions, a simple but varied menu, very fast service and (for Amsterdam, …"
