55,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,It is the best Dignita location. By far better than the one in Vondelpark. You are in a nice glass building and it feels so refreshing and natural being in it. The service is nicer. The food and garnishing is marvelous. I would reccomend it to anyone.

70,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,A hidden gem in the heart of Amsterdam. Breakfast very well priced and when in summer a lovely terrace. What a nice place. Nice staff as well. Also a good place for just a drink in the busy city.
71,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"The place is beautiful and peaceful, especially in a sunny autumn day. The food is good and well presented, some of my friends found their dishes a little bit bland though. The service is okay but it was quite crowded I wouldn‚Äôt recommend if you are in a rush! Prices are okay compared to the average price for brunches in Amsterdam."

85,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,5 months ago,Terrible and rude service.  The host was very rude when we arrived and then our table service was anemicly slow.  I offered to show my Canadian vaccine card and I think the host took offense.   Not sure why?  If you are a tourist I'd suggest skipping this place.
86,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had a lovely brunch here the other day.  They serve up a really delicious range of greens in a comfortable casual setting. Perfect place for a lazy weekend morning.  And if you‚Äôre feeling it, they also serve some pretty good Spritz. :)"

123,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,This is the kind of secret place you like to experience when you're discovering the city. Hidden in a beautiful garden the food is as good as the location.

137,Dignita Hoftuin, 3 stars ,8 months ago,Service was mediocre. Food looked very promising but didnt meet our expectations and expected quality. Overall a little overpriced. We did however enjoyed the scenery! So if you prioritize ambiance over quality of service and food this is one to go to.

158,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious food in a beautiful, serene environment. Service was OK. Only criticism would be that moist food like ham, avocado and cheese was served on top of a serviette - the food sticks and you have to pick bits of serviette off the food... #wewantplates"

201,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Stop trying so hard. There‚Äôs no need for the packet of trail mix on top of the pancakes and no need to cure the smoked salmon. Simple is better! The hollandaise sauce is perfectly silky, citrusy and creamy. Eggs are fine and bacon is fine."

285,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the nicest breakfast spots in Amsterdam. In a lovely area near the zoo. We did have to wait about 20 minutes for a table inside but it was worth the wait!
286,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. This place is gorgeous and offers a beautiful garden to chill out or wait for a table to sit. The food was delicious, but took a while to arrive."
287,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Good service, good view and good food but small portion.  Ordered avocado sandwich with poached egg, which was good, but was still hungry afterwards. ‚Ä¶"
288,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Dignita Hoftuin is a nice place to get a brunch. You will literally have enough food for your what you pay and it's really tasty. Our waitress were super friendly, patient and helpful. Totally recommend this place !"
289,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Service is really bad, waitresses do not offer you a table, you have to find it yourself, once you find a table it is not cleaned, waitresses do not look at you at all, we had to wave our hands 3 times at least to get a reaction which was ‚Ä¶"
290,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cozy place and healthy food. Very crowded but worth it.
291,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"My wife decided to have nice Sunday breakfast at this place based on very good rating of the place. When we came we understood why this place is so popular: it's very cozy and charming, very nice atmosphere! ‚Ä¶"
292,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place for breakfast if it wasn't for the 1hr+ waiting time in the cold to get a table. Luckily the hermitage museum is located right next to it so I suggest a quick browse there whilst waiting.
293,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favourite brunch spots in Amsterdam. Lovely setting, actually friendly service, and fresh and delicious food. Grab a seat in the garden on a nice day and you're all set."
294,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious brunch in a beautiful location - it‚Äôs a shame there‚Äôs going to be some construction nearby (there‚Äôs a memorial being built) but it doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that food is top-notch. Great options for vegetarians and vegans, too!"
295,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The tasty food and overall atmosphere made this spot one of the most memorable of my trip.  I also love they have a mission for sustainability!
296,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"It is a wonderful little place, located in the middle of a garden with lots of grass and a beautiful glass windows view. The food is a delicious and the coffee is great. Very warm and nice atmosphere, and very kind service. Recommend this one big time."
297,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,a week ago,Good quality local food
298,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food. Try the pancakes, they are the best !"
299,Dignita Hoftuin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Don't go here during the weekend. We were told 35-45 min is their usual waiting time to receive your food after ordering. This is unacceptable, especially for a lunch room. Management should really step in and do something about it. The food is good."
300,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I guess it has very good brunch because 2 friends of mine auggestest it but keep in mind that you either have to wait for 30-40 minutes to get a table or make a reservation! Unfortunately did not have the time to wait
301,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"After a day out and planning around eating here, at 5.07pm we were told the kitchen had closed at 5pm. This may be why the staff ignored us until we sat down and requested a menu. Although she later told us they're still open for drinks for ‚Ä¶"
302,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great place for all day breakfast and lunch. Tables inside and outside. Small menu (like I like) with unusual dishes - want to try them all. Worth coming back. Thanks for quick serving.
303,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"I think it is a very expensive and has poor service. I ask for the Avocado with the egg  very well done and no mayonese, (because I'm pregnant and I can't eat raw eggs), and they have to bring the plate 3 times because the egg was raw, and ‚Ä¶"
304,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,Not easy to spot. But therefore even better. Food is fantastic. And the terras in the little park refreshing and makes you feel light.
305,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quite a cosy little place, with an amusing little snack menu. Its located in the garden area of the Hermitage Museum. So great to have a nice warm drink straight after your visit, it is however accesible from a street entrance, without being obliged to go to the museum."
306,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A heavenly place outside. The food was delicious and of high quality. Bring a lot of time with you on the weekend, as there are long waiting times, which, however, quickly evaporate on the benches of the facility around."
307,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is my absolutely favourite place to come with children. It feels like a family business where you see staff so switched on, organised , and kind. Service is really extremeley fast, coffee and food delicious and just over all amazing atmosphere always."
308,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We only sat outside, but the atmosphere was great."
309,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great location in middle of park and close to the Hermitage museum. The food was amazing. Fresh ingredients with quick service. We really enjoyed it.
310,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"superb setting, garden, food, ambiance"
311,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"Great food, but terrible Bloody Mary‚Äôs"
312,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"It become one of my favorite spots after the first time I had brunch there with my friend. Loved it! As a lactose intolerant, I fancy their vegan options"
313,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Location: Amazing
Food: Okay
Service: Pathetic ‚Ä¶"
314,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Loved this place. We had a rainy afternoon, but the bright coulors and the great tastes made up for it. Firendly staff, nice atmosphere, tasty food! Will def. visit them next time we are in Amsterdam!"
315,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"This is an amazing cafe/restaurant with amazing view of the hermitage museum and garden. My friend and I met here on a rainy day, it is amazing to sit inside and see the rain outside in the garden. The food here is very nice. I ordered ‚Ä¶"

317,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,Lovely place and great garden. Staff is very kind and the food is fresh and tasty. Came back a second time and definitely recommend.
318,Dignita Hoftuin, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Beautiuiful location , food is outstanding , nice coffee too. However the service was terrible. Don't get me wrong, they were nice people. However I think they may be just inexperienced or lacking strong leadership. It took 20 mins for ‚Ä¶"
319,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Great food and location. Only downside: the service (there are a lot of waitresses - who never smile or appologize - but you wait a long time for everything, coffee arrived after meal - at every table)"
320,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good and delicious food in the upper price range.

It is definitely worth a visit due to the location and the restaurants ambience. Great taste and food but a little high prices."
321,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Food is amazing! Service can be a little slow but just depends on how busy they are! No reservations taken on a Saturday so go before 10.30am to secure a spot! It's our favourite spot for sure!
322,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Went there for brunch, amazing place, great location, very good food and coffee and juices.
Nice options, went with the Sweet Start and it was great! Very nice staff too."
323,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great place with brilliant atmosphere (all glass in garden) - a little bit of a secret spot. Open 10-6 usually with straightforward good organic simple far, with a twist. It is also a social enterprise which helps community so an added incentive"
324,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Love the food, the concept and the kiddy corner for them to play in!"
325,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,I was excited when I heard Dignata took over the museum cafe here as I was a big fan of their original location near Vondelpark.  They have an exceptional menu with unique and well-crafted dishes. I usually only get the Benny Boy (bacon ‚Ä¶
326,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice place, good menu, nice people and in summer or spring: nice place to hang out. During lunch time it can be really crowded and that s a pity. If you don't book a table you might be waiting for a while. Very un-Dutch. Lots of tourists but it is Amsterdam center..."
327,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good breakfast. Not worth going specially for that from a distance
328,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"One of my favourite place in Amsterdam, the staff is friendly and coffee is good. Pancake now is strawberry favour, portion is quite big to finish. I recommend to share."
329,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Good products, well prepared, from starter to desert including coffee blend.
Very nice place, nordic design, very sunny.
Perfect for a brunch. Various choices.
A bit noisy."
330,Dignita Hoftuin, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Second time to this place. It is a cozy place to be with your family and friends here only if you have a plenty of time!  Service is quite slow for these two times and It took 40 mins to bring our drinks first time and 50mins to bring the ‚Ä¶
331,Dignita Hoftuin, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Have to agree with Marc below, and this is coming from a longtime visitor to the Dignita close to Vondelpark. It‚Äôs not just that it‚Äôs understaffed (because obviously that‚Äôs not the fault of the waiters), but to be on the receiving end of ‚Ä¶"
332,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Brunch with the guys in Amsterdam adjacent to the hermitage museum.  Teamwork service and quality variety of food choices.  Accomodated a multi-course brunch on the terrace for 5 with no reservations.  Minimal and acceptable order errors.
333,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of the greatest places in Amsterdam for breakfast and branch, nice atmosphere and friendly staff üëçüèº"
334,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place where to have brunch :)
335,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing building, but the lamb sandwich is not to be missed... Neither was their ""Pride Cocktail"" but that may have been temporary. Delicious food!"
336,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent brunch plates, some very original plates. Also, quite kind friendly with a toy area + garden outside. Except a bit of wait if you don't come early."
337,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,2 months ago,"Rude and unwelcoming personal, would not recommend to anyone."
338,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Monday 20th, 12:45 am. I‚Äôm in here right now and I‚Äôm writing this review. We sat down outside and waited for almost 10 minutes with no service. I made eye contact with the blonde male server at least 3 times but he just ignored us and kept ‚Ä¶"
339,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Beautiful, green and sustainable hotspot. Delicious food and good coffee."
340,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing food. Fair price. Good service.
341,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Brunch enough said, very good waitresses"
342,Dignita Hoftuin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food here used to be better than it is now
343,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely quiet garden, nice service and enjoyable organic  food"
344,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Organic food, healthy options, vegetarian, and mostly a complete oasis of peace in the center of the city - especially in warm weather. Coffee is completely average, but the experience and design are top."
345,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Great food and lovely environment. It's worth a visit but check Google to see if they are busy. Service can be very slow during the busy period. I observed people leaving in frustration which is unfortunately a lost opportunity.
346,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice spot hidden in the garden of the Hermitage Museum. The outdoor seating is really comfy. External walls made of glass are really beautiful and relaxing.
347,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Brunch was great and beautifully presented
348,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The sister restaurant of Dignita in the Old West (Vondelpark) this branch attracts a more upscale and touristy crowd. It really is a fantastic setting with glass walls all around and a huge outdoor area for summer eating and drinking. Personally I do prefer the other branch for the more low key, neighbourhood vibes."
349,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Best brunch in town üòçüòçüòç
350,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"One of my favourite brunch spots in the city.  The food is excellent and the decor is lovely; the garden location is also pretty, especially in autumn."
351,Dignita Hoftuin, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I have come here a number of times now. The food is always delicious, the service is friendly, BUT everytime I come they seem to loose our order. I don't like to wait for 45min for my breakfast while other people that came later are enjoying theirs already. I am sorry but this was my last visit."
352,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food is good and the garden beautiful. However, the service is really bad and the staff very rude. It' s a pity with such a nice place."
353,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great service, lovely garden, friendly staff, good food. Be there early so you don't need to wait a century to get a table :)"
354,Dignita Hoftuin, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"We order the Benedict with the salmon dish, and we surprised to receive a small dish at a cost of 14 euros. The dish inclode one slice of bread, number of salmon pieces, 2 eggs and gravy. In our opinion, it is very overprice."
355,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful restaurant in the courtyard of the Hermitage.  They serve all day brunch along with coffee house staples.   It's a little pricy, but the food is excellent."
356,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,7 months ago,The most secret place in town. So do not tell anybody how lovely it is here. Just go and visit the peace here.
357,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Nice staff and great breakfast üí™üèΩ
358,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely decor and delicious food, brunch classics with a twist. Brilliant terrace in summer !"
359,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Really impressive meal and location, strongly recommend!!!"
360,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,All day brunch. Wonderful food and presentation. You enjoy your meal surrounded by bay windows in the middle of a lovely park. A delightful meal in an oasis of peace.
361,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Probably the best pancakes in Amsterdam!
362,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Lovely place with a nice selection of healthy lunch options
363,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Busy on a sunny day, but great lunch place with delicious savory and sweet options, and tasty coffees and drinks. Certainly worth a stop if in the area."
364,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Such a beautiful place ! The service was slow, but the food was good and so was the coffee. It is not cheap, but ok priced, leaning to pricey. The location is great too. It's an oasis in the city."
365,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Beautiful location, friendly staff and top quality food for reasonable prices. Whether you sit inside the glass building or outside on their terrace, you feel like you're in a little oasis."
366,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very cosy place in 'secret' garden, where you can escape the razzle-dazzle of the city while enjoying some delicious food or tasty drinks. Would recommend this place for brunch and good coffee!"
367,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Super nice place for a brunch/coffee.. although not the same vibe as the Vondelpark location. By closing time there are some weird people surrounding the Hoftuin so be cautious.
368,Dignita Hoftuin, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"Even though the place is beautiful the service is awful. During a busy day we had to wait, 30 min to order, 30 min for a coffee and 45 for the food. The service during rush hour shows which restaurant is good or not. Not recommended"
369,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"I guess in this Tuin , garden very unique concept in Amsterdam . Healthy , sub stainable food meets beautiful inside next to museum . When weather good you can sit outside and enjoy the view . Amazing brunch"
370,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Place is very nice with alot of natural light. I had a goat cheese sandwich that was very bad! So not sure if all thier food is bad,  coffee and apple tart were nice though!"
371,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,Their food is tasty and especially their vegan dishes are amazing. Packs of flavors!
372,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic food (not ""samey"" like so many brunch spots), very friendly staff and all for a good cause."
373,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,My favorite of the Dignita locations- such a lovely patio. All the locations serve a tasty consistent breakfast
374,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing menu with many great breakfast and lunch options for a reasonable price. I've been here multiple times and enjoyed it every time
375,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delicious fresh food, great staff, nice atmosphere. Feels like a tranquil hideaway in the city as it's located inside the courtyard of the Hermitage museum."
376,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Incredible brunch. Great decor/design. Benny Boy = poached eggs on potato hash with apple cider hollandaise. Zucchini and chickpea fritters with halloumi and mint yoghurt.
377,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Love the open air space.  Quiet and relaxing.
378,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Top place with excellent menu. Very good location in the middle of a museum / park setting. Reasonable pricing as well.
379,Dignita Hoftuin, 2 stars ,3 years ago,one of those places where you'd better eat BEFORE coming here. Took them 30 mins to bring a cappuccino. Food is good but nothing spectacular. Come if you like pretentious places.
380,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best pancakes ever! Nomnomnom
381,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The nicest Caf√© I‚Äôve been in Amsterdam, with a very beautiful open area. Cozy, friendly, surrounded by gardens and trees. My favorite!"
382,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Simple honest food, a little overpriced but spacious, clean toilets, vegan option. One staff member was lovely, the other wouldn't even bring us some milk."
383,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious brunch. Very friendly staff they let us bring our small dog inside when it was raining outside. Food is very good.
384,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great food and terrace, but the cocktails are lame - for a 9 euros GT I wasn‚Äôt expecting a tiny glass where you could barely taste any gin üòñ"
385,Dignita Hoftuin, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The staff lost our food order, the coffee was disgusting, one of the waitresses was incredibly rude and the beer tasted like metal. I‚Äôm never going back there again."
386,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Always a nice place for brunch. Food is ok but it has a kids friendly corner with toys. If sunny there is a nice garden  :)
387,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Very good brunch, original seasoning and toppings. Friendly staff and nice ambiance.
Would strongly recommend"
388,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Quality of food fits the spacy atmosphere at this finely designed loft, embedded on the backyard of Hermitage museum, where its modern setting remarks the artful surrounding."

395,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Loved it! Cozy, beautiful and very delicious food. Vegan options and nice staff."
396,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazingly cute brunch spot nestled away in a small park. Nice to be away from the hustle and bustle of Amsterdam, this place sucks you away with equally appetizing food options"
397,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,9 months ago,Always excellent food and service. Staff is wonderful.
398,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Thirty time there (I don't live in Amsterdam) Perfect food, happy sevice just a great place. Prizes verry good!!"

400,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Very cosy garden with a great caf√©. The service was a bit slow but otherwise a lovely place. Worth a visit after the museum or just for a relaxing moment away from the city stress.

402,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Same taste and service as in the other Dignita, so great! Major plus, the beautiful view of the garden. Major minus, is really small inside."

This cozy cafe is in the middle of a garden with nice view and even better food. Highly recommended."

410,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,a year ago,Really nice place with a garden for brunch / lunch. Good menu and choices
411,Dignita Hoftuin, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is great! If the weather is inviting, the best is to sit outside. The food took a while, but it was worth the wait :)"
412,Dignita Hoftuin, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very busy place and no wonder - everything they served was YUMMY!
Even though it was crowded, their friendly staff made it very easy to get a place to sit by sitting many parties at the same table. Gezelliiiiiig!"
