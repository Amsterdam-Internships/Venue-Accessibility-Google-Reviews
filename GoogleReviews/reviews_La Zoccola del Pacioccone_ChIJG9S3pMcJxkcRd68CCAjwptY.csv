52,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We were told La Perla was the best pizza place in town. Went here first on a whim to grab a meal. This place is MILES better than La Perla and may be the best pizza I‚Äôve eaten. Go here. You will NOT be disappointed. ‚Ä¶

59,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Small little Italian Pizzeria tucked down a narrow alley here in Amsterdam. If you're looking for authenticity and not re-heated pizza out on the street.... this place is a must!

73,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 1 star ,a month ago,"Bad experience, long long wait on a low weekday  didn‚Äôt have the beers on the list they promote, staff has changed they can barely pronounce the menu list, not sure Italians owners are the same, pizza was really under average, place is tight you can barely reach tables and prices are above gourmet ranging from 15 to 20 euros."
74,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the few true italian restaurants in Amsterdam. Authentic italian vibe, music, staff, ingredients... everything even the wine and the beer. Real authentic puffy white mozzarella cheese. And a sweet sweet red sauce! Lovely indeed. This ‚Ä¶"

138,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,a year ago,Honestly the best pizza I have ever had ! I saw reviews on here and I went to the bar next door as we were waiting for a table. The waitress came next door and told us hour table was ready which is amazing .The service was amazing and the staff were amazing and the food . OH MY GOD ! Incredible!!!. Worth a visit
139,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Our pizza was under coocked, we ordered beer and got weird italian wine"
140,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Great pizzas !! Oven made crust, great toppings. Service was okay but don't think you'll spend a lot of time there. Our order was ready in 5 mins and they basically invited us to pay the bill as soon as we finished. But food was great !"
141,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best pizza restaurant in Amsterdam, hands down.

This place has an incredible buzz and atmosphere. It's so small yet so powerful ‚Ä¶"
142,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Lovely Italian place! My Italian friend who is very picky about food from her native country took me here - in other words, it's quite authentic! It's a pretty small and cosy  place, with a selection of pizzas for both herbivores and ‚Ä¶"
143,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The reviews tell the truth. Great pizza at reasonable prices with amazing service. By amazing I mean knowledgeable and friendly - seriously the best we've had in Amsterdam despite how busy this place is. Our pizzas were both great and we couldn't finish them - but not through want of trying...
144,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious pizza, nice place, great service"
145,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best pizza I have had in a very very long time. Including many in Italy. Great service, great atmosphere. The tiramisu was also amazing. No idea why anyone would rate any less than 5 star. Perfection."
146,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably that day I was unlucky: I have heard so many good reviews from people that have been there but actually my pizza was not so good... Very weirdly cooked, unevenly cooked. One side was burned and the other almost not cooked. ‚Ä¶"
147,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Good pizza. The dough is Neopolitan style. The restaurant is really tiny so expect a bit of a wait. Affordable considering the location. The waiting staff was very polite and helpful. Pizza and 1 drink less than 17 euro, in Naples would be less, but this is Amsterdam. IMHO worth it."
148,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,one of the best pizzas I‚Äôve ever had! so good I went back two nights later and was definitely not disappointed the second time around! the service was pretty fast and the staff was very friendly... the pizza was absolutely delicious and so full of flavor‚Äî a tiny spot but well worth the wait! 10/10!!!
149,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favourite pizza places! Every time I visit the city, I have to come here for dinner. One thing I always forget is how generous they are with portions, one pizza is enough to set you up for a day so if you're a light eater, might be worth sharing with someone!"
150,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great pizza place near Amsterdam Central. The restaurant is very cosy and could have long waiting  time as they have only 5-6 tables. But the service is super friendly and pretty quick. Ordered an Italian beer which went really well with the pizza. The pizza was so filling that it didn't leave any space for dessert.
151,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Best pizza I've ever had in my life! Super cozy and friendly restaurant, feels like home! 200% recommended. Very friendly staff, fresh ingredients, simple but outstanding flavours! Came from Rotterdam to try it out is totally worth the ride! Good job guys keep it up!"
152,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Pizza... this place is all about pizza, freshly baked from the stone oven. No nonsense, crammed in like sardines but everyone's having a good time which makes for a great atmosphere. Top notch pizza, very generous with the size and the toppings too. Definitely worth a visit."
153,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The Pizza here is really good. The dough is the soft type, Naples style. Fresh ingredients, and authentic cheese from Italy, generous toppings. It's a tad more expensive than other pizza places in the city, but you are sitting in the heart of Amsterdam, so there's that. They don't take reservations, there is a decent wait, not too long."
154,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Authentic Italian pizza, delicious! Highly recommend Bufala and Napoli (if you like anchovies)."

157,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely the best pizza in the city centre. Never waited longer then 10 minutes. Most of the staff is very nice. The place really feels like you're in Italy. The staff is all Italian and the place is always filled with Italians. But most of all the pizza is very good and just like a great pizza in Italy.
158,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Been here twice now and both were among the best pizza experiences I have had anywhere in the world. Both occasions I enjoyed the Bufala pizza but my coworker had the marinara this last week and as she is not a cheese lover and said it was ‚Ä¶
159,La Zoccola del Pacioccone, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best pizza I've ever had, there is a queue but we only had to wait for 15 minutes and there is handily a bar next door which the staff come in and get you from!
