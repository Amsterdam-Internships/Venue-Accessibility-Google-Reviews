0,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great place to hang out with friends and play bar games or board games. The staff is super friendly and the overall atmosphere is fun.
Its a little expensive but worth a visit. The only bad thing is how loud the music is."
1,The Poolbar, 2 stars ,a week ago,"Nice atmosphere, reasonably priced drinks. Staff need to work on their customer tracking/queue system. We waited over 2hrs for a table (admittedly on a busy Saturday evening, so that's understandable) but we got passed over repeatedly for a ‚Ä¶"

28,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I went to The Poolbar only once and i had such a great time that I already had decided i would celebrate my birthday there. I emailed them asking about it and got a very fast response. Rob was very nice and called me to give me more details ‚Ä¶
29,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,8 months ago,I love the pool bar
30,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great place to play some pool and hangout. Staff were really nice and it was a great atmosphere. ‚Ç¨13 an hour for a pool table seemed a bit steep but other than that I'd highly recommend it.

32,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly staff and cheap renting prices for the pool tables. Choice from medium size and (some) large size tables.
The space around the medium tables can sometimes be a little narrow, but nothing ‚Ä¶"
33,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to get some cold beers and play pool. Best thing is the rock old school music if you are a fan of that. Outside space on a small and  cute street in the heart of Amsterdam! Smoking only outside of you need to know! Cool place so far!
34,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Lovely bar, and they have a lot of pool tables downstairs. You can smoke while playing pool (inside the premises). This might be quite attractive for some pool enthusiasts. For others, it's a shame, as you will leave stinking of cigarette ‚Ä¶"
35,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"If you're looking for a place to have a drink and play some pool, look no further.
This place is huge and there are lots of quality tables to play at. ‚Ä¶"
36,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Big-sized bar with a decent amount of pool tables. Prices aren't bad for it to be located on the city centre. Music's pretty good and staff's very friendly, my partner and I were hosted by this kind Dutch barman who made our night a lot better. Finally found a proper pool bar in Amsterdam. Definitely coming back."
37,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"It was an amazing experience.

Wasnt too busy when we arrived, the barman suggested drinks for us and gave us some good tips before we played a couple of games of pool. Will definitely be going back again"
38,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Get staff, great music. They play requests! Plus, good beers!"
39,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Lots of people and lots of fun, even two regulation tables. Very cramped as expected for this city, and some shots cannot be made even without people in the way so come for fun or practice...and a nice staff serving cold beers.  And the kitties, of course!"
40,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Great service, genuinely friendly staff. Not expensive. Great atmosphere and a nice amount of pool tables in good condition. Don't worry, there are regular bar seats, tables and a cozy corner as well, away from the pool tables. A definite recommendation."
41,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Had a good night here playing a solo game of pool and watching the England v Russia football match. ‚Ä¶
42,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It was a small but nice little bar, we visited whilst on holiday for the weekend and we're looking for somewhere to watch the Manu Vs ManC Derby.
The beer was reasonably priced and we enjoyed the music  played. However it being a sports bar I expected bigger TVs and better seating around them."

44,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Nice pool bar, also has a bunch of board games to play if you're not coming to play pool. Music is a bit loud though, which makes conversation a bit difficult."
45,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,3 years ago,If you fancy some pool and a beer this is the place to be. I was impressed with the amount of tables each well lit with ample space. What more can a lad want? If I were to change 1 thing it would be the lack of decent cues however that's minor as its a bit of fun.
46,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"It might look a little dubious or run down from the ourside, but it is very much just the character for The Pool Bar! They have plenty of tables available and charge by the minute, but the prices are extremely reasonable, and they have more ‚Ä¶"
47,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the most easy going places I know!
Very friendly staff, lots of pool tables and other games if you need to wait.
Enough space if you want to have beers in a small group."
48,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Cool casual pub with a wide selection of pub and board games aside from the pool. The vibe is sort of friendly in that 'sitcom bar after work hangout' kind of way? Prepare for a long wait for pool on weekends
49,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,The Poolbar is a place where you can go on any day at you will always have a good time. It is a great place to start your evening in Amsterdam with friends and you will definitely enjoy yourself here. The staff is friendly and they have plenty of things to do.
50,The Poolbar, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Good place for a game of pool, no doubt. However, I'm giving a low rating as they served the worst coffee, by far, of any place I've ever been to in any country. Truly disgusting. It makes me wonder why it was so bad..."
51,The Poolbar, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"It's a fun dive bar. Cheap beer, pool tables (expect a really long wait during the weekend), board games, etc. Friendly staff who take care of the pool queue. You will smell like cigarettes by the time you leave though."
52,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,3 months ago,Great music and close to center.
53,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,7 years ago,"Both pool and board games such as Backgammon are available. Great tournaments, friendly people (both staff and guests). Reasonable prices for drinks, especially a pitcher of beer and Jagermeister shots. The only con is that it's allowed to smoke inside."
54,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"The place is basically split into two parts. In the bar area you'll find plenty of (free) board games, a TV is usually showing sports, great music and a staff that always delivers a nice atmosphere. I always feel like home a bit. Except for ‚Ä¶"
55,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Its a pool bar. Great ambience in the evenings with board games and pool tables. Shuttle boards available with a dart board. Snack bites available.

Folks are mostly under 20 tho, at least when I was there üòÖ felt kinda odd, but its not the bars fault"

58,The Poolbar, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice bar with Pooltables in the smoking area. Prices are okay and there is lots of room. I was a bit disapointed when the staff didn't want to plug in my phone, and pointed to a paid charging station.

59,The Poolbar, 5 stars ,10 months ago,Great atmosphere with a great staff. The neighbors upstairs were pretty cool too.

66,The Poolbar, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Bustling pool bar, not necessarily popular only for the pool tables. Bar area is rather small, there are a lot of board games + more. You can smoke in the pool area which makes it a bit annoying for non-smokers."
