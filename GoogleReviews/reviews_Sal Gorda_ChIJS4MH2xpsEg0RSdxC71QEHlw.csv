7,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing and worth the wait (approx 30 minutes). Risotto with shrimp, potatoes croquette filled in with cheese and local ham went down a treat.

8,Sal Gorda, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"There was an hour wait for a table. But the food was with it. We had the pork cheek and mousse which was tasty, we just wished there was more of it. The complementary olives are delicious. We ordered an extra round. The shrimp risotto was ‚Ä¶"

it‚Äôs even cheaper than any tapas bar here and it worth it ! ‚Ä¶"
12,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Hidden gem of a tapas restaurant. More genuine, less touristy - locals are queueing for a spot and that says something. Not fancy, but really good food and nice staff."
13,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If u ever find yourself in Sevilla, you have to check out this little fusion tapas place. Service is friendly and it complements the food it serves. I visited this place twice consecutively, first for dinner then lunch. Everything is so ‚Ä¶"
14,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Fantastic food, great staff and beautiful ambient. If you want to experience a fancy food for a reasonable price go here! I had 4 tapas, 2 red wines and a Sherry and paid 22 Euros. I totally recommend this and their friend sea anemone"
15,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,This was probably the best meal we had in Spain. Each dish you see on the pictures was absolutely delicious. The price you pay for such high quality food is ridiculously low. The only thing we didn't like was the sause on patatas bravas.
16,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,9 months ago,One of my favourite tapas bar. Each tapa has a specific taste with the little twist we like
17,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"GREAT MODERN TAPAS. The menu essentially contains variations of classic Spanish tapas. We ordered:
‚Äî olive oil tasting, ‚Ä¶"

Glad I did,as being a foodie I put it in my five top restaurants,for service,taste,quality and price. ‚Ä¶"

Rabo de Toro are amazing!
Recommend to try!"
23,Sal Gorda, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"A cute spot for dinner if you want to break from traditional tapas. We ordered croquetas with Jamon, salmorejo, bass with ponzu sauce and patatas brava. Everything was tasty, but I'd recommend skipping the potatoes if you don't like too ‚Ä¶"
24,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,3 months ago,The beef tartare and bacalao alone make this place worth the visit. They also have four to five decent Andalusian reds and local craft beer in cans.
25,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough! Great service, staff were really friendly and happy to explain things in English. The colo de toro was a particular highlight. Amazingly priced as well - about ‚Ç¨14 each for dinner and a drink"
26,Sal Gorda, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good tapas. Especially the ox tail (cola de toro), amazing based on my experience in Sevilla, highly recommended, definitely one of the tops, thought I would say it would be better if they put less teriyaki sauce."

28,Sal Gorda, 4 stars ,4 months ago,Enjoyed the food but we didn't feel treated the same as the locals. I wish my Spanish was better but all round the food and beer selection was good.
29,Sal Gorda, 1 star ,2 years ago,TOURIST. TRAP. Worst tapas in all of Spain. No flavour and slow service. I was sitting right in front the cashier and tried to get my bill for 20 minutes but the cashier kept telling me to hold on while he was on the phone. 3 other tables ‚Ä¶

39,Sal Gorda, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Waiting time is a problem, although food is great. Queuing for 45 mins and having to wait for 40 mins for a second order, makes it difficult to come back. Grilled fish is a must order."
40,Sal Gorda, 4 stars ,4 years ago,great place for tapas with a modern twist!! service was friendly and there was a good selection of craft beers! i'm usually not a beef tartare fan - but this was delicious!!!
41,Sal Gorda, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"I had rated this very highly on a previous visit, 5 stars in fact, but having most recent visit was a very poor experience. A 1 Star experience and so I have amalgamated the scores. Where as the first visit was a perfect example of great ‚Ä¶"

47,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very good quality tapas with good service. Andalusian glass of wine good too. Really enjoyed. Prices reasonable.
48,Sal Gorda, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Had the worst experience ever. They took my olive away without asking if I am working on it or not. Had to ASK to get my change back because they did not intend to give me the change at all. Had the risotto which was ok, but  pretty sure ‚Ä¶"
49,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,a year ago,"After 4 years I relived my best food memory of Seville.

4 years ago we came upon this fun tapas bar and really wanted to try their food. ‚Ä¶"
50,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Innovative cuisine; every item delicious. Fantastic wines by the glass. Incredibly reasonable pricing. Friendly and patient staff. Don't forget dessert!
51,Sal Gorda, 4 stars ,5 years ago,It is top notch quality tapas and worth a visit if you want to try modern style tapas. They absolutely know how to choose their wines too. Pricey.

56,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,a year ago,Fabulous restaurant with friendly staff. The tapas we're phenomenally good. Great flavour combinations.  A veritable gastronomical adventure.  So good we visited twice in a three day visit to Seville.
57,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic tapas, innovative in presentation and combinations of ingredients. The staff is very friendly and helpful with the translation and wine selection. I ate there twice over a three day period. The three tartare they offer along with the risotto are excellent."
58,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Tasty food, a little different and maybe more interesting take on the spanish/andalucian classics. Good wine, too."
59,Sal Gorda, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Shocking service and style over substance food. The waiter (short man with a beard) was probably the rudest waiter I‚Äôve ever encountered. He wasn‚Äôt like this to just the tourists, but also to the locals and Spanish speakers. ‚Ä¶"
60,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,a month ago,Amazing inventive tapas at a very reasonable price
61,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fantastic quality tapas at a fair price. They have their own spin on some traditional plates but everything was absolutely delicious. We ate upstairs and it was a really calm pleasant atmosphere and great service. Would definitely recommend!

Most of all the culo de Toro is incredible !! ‚Ä¶"
63,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Fantastic. A foodie's tapas place. Not your usual stuff. The orange dessert was delightful.

65,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Warm and friendly staff who speak some English but very willing to help with menu which only comes in Spanish. We were attended to the second we walked in the door. The girl who waited on our table was very helpful in recommending a few ‚Ä¶
66,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"A very good tapas restaurant! The staff are very friendly and know everything you want to know about the menu. The tapas are a lot fancier than regular tapas you find in other street restaurants, but, they were by far the best tapas we had ‚Ä¶"
67,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Great place, great staff and delicious food. We definitely enjoyed our dinner at Sal Gorda and treated ourselves with mouth-watering Spanish tapas and wines. Keep it in mind and book in advance or try your luck as the place isn‚Äôt that big and get busy. Enjoy."
68,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Even better than the food, which was very good but not excellent, is the service. There was a lady server (forgot to ask her name) who patiently took us through EVERY item in the menu. Was always around and never impatient. I'd go there just for her service again. Oh but on another note , the beef tartare is amazing."
69,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,a year ago,"More seating upstairs. The staff were friendly and enthusiastic. Some of the food was slower in arriving, but it was fairly busy. Not too sure about the Sea Urchin experience, but a great time was had by all."
70,Sal Gorda, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Mixed feelings, may give them a second chance because they seem to have some yummy dishes, but not really keen on so called Asian touches having lived last 10 years in Asia... One pro and friendly waiter, the other one being a bit agitated ‚Ä¶"
71,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Very nice food (especially the pork meats) and friendly waiters. Best to come around 20:30 - 21:00 or you might not find a spot.
72,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"High quality and friendly, at a fair price. Everything we ate and saw served to other tables was great. The place was filled early, with others trolling along the lane waiting for a free table. But we never felt rushed by the staff."
73,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Really good food, great service and very fresh."
74,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner here during our visit in Sevilla. The food was delicious and our server was so helpful and friendly. They also served craft beer which was a bonus. We sat outside and enjoyed watching people passing by in the street.
75,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"One of the best tapas of Sevilla. It's a must-see.
A large variety of different dishes and local wines, absolutely delightful and the prices are more than correct for the quality. We definetly recommend ! We've ‚Ä¶"

77,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Wonderful service. Great food. I ordered 6 Tapas and all of them were nice. I don't know much but I think it wasn't much of a traditional spanish dish. As I could find little twist in here and there-such as kimchi chicken and gaspacho with ‚Ä¶

80,Sal Gorda, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food was OK but impossible to enjoy since the service was so painfully slow and disinterested.  Most of it was cold by the time it eventually arrived. Not even an apology.  When we explained how long we had waited, Alberto the manager ‚Ä¶"
81,Sal Gorda, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Very convenient location for us near our apartment, and quite unexpected variations on tapas and traditional rustic fare such as beef cheek and deconstructed tortillas. The prices are very competitive, with snappy service. Very busy on a midweek night. Check it out."
82,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of my favorite restaurants in Sevilla! The food is elaborate and delicious. From the unique tortilla de patata to the specials fuera de la carta that are always wonderful, I can't recommend this place more! The service is also incredibly friendly and so helpful."
83,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"If you are a true foodie, go here. Anthony Bourdain üôè quality. House vermouth is great. Oxtail teriyaki, tomato tartar, ground almond and garlic soup, grilled lamb, Iberian meats cannelloni, mushroom/truffle and shrimp risotto‚Äî Everything ‚Ä¶"
84,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Excellent and unusual tapas, good wines and craft beers (in addition to the more regular draught beer). Enthusiastic staff. We paid a surprisingly low price for 6 amazing tapas, 2 regular beers, 3 glasses of wine, and 3 portions of bread."

91,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Original, refined and tasty tapas!"
92,Sal Gorda, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"It was fine and a cute spot but many other tapas places are better. The patatas bravas had way too much sauce and the other dishes were just okay, nothing memorable"
93,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had excellent ox tail, some kind of cheese and meat rolls, seems like they have excellent food.
Service was ok, but staff seemed veeery tired towards the end of the program, didn't feel welcome. They are early overworked."
94,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Walked in here on a busy night, which was no small feat. But worth it. It was faster to sit inside since most wanted to sit outside, which was fine with us because there were a lot of smokers that night. I really enjoyed the Deconstructed ‚Ä¶"

103,Sal Gorda, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"The sea bass in adobo sauce was the best tapa I've had since arriving in Spain more than three weeks ago. The craft beers were a nice touch. Five tapas, two beers and desert cost only 35 euros. Amazing!"

122,Sal Gorda, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The service was excellent but food was just good. I recommend the ""patatas bravas"", the risotto and the ropa vieja Canneloni. Price was very good for a restaurant in such a good place but food needs to improve."
