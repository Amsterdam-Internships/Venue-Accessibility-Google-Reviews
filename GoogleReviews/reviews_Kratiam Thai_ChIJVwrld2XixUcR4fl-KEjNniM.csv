0,Kratiam Thai, 3 stars ,2 weeks ago,"A 5 star rating in the past. Now, with the new owners, unfortunately what used to be my family's favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood has become avarage. Taste, structure and quality of our favourite dishes changed over night."
1,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Quality of the food is amazing 😋😋😋. It is definitely worth waiting and return.
Service is attentive. Kitchen however is loaded with take away orders and table …"
2,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Excellent food, freshly cooked, great service. Open kitchen to watch as your food is cooked. Small sized restaurant but plenty of tables outside if the weather is good. …"
3,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Tasty Thai food, but I find the service a bit rushed. After ordering the main dishes, I wanted to add some side dishes but the waitress already hastily walked away. Also, there were some Thai friends/colleagues sitting in the restaurant who …"
4,Kratiam Thai, 3 stars ,7 months ago,"The food is pricey but tasted great. The restaurant is however severely understaffed. Some guests got up and left after 30+ minutes of waiting time. The outside seating is nice to have, but they clearly don't have capacity for a reasonably fast service. They don't accept VISA cards either."
5,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"This restaurant is top notch,  the waiters are really helpful and kind and took the time to explain the difference between the different choices, the service was fast and the food was really amazing."
6,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Probably the best Pad Thai in town
7,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Food is good, decently priced. It could be way more spicy though. Tried one of their spiciest dishes and it wasn't spicy at all! The Tom yum Kung was also really sour, that's a matter of taste"
8,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,a year ago,"I loved it, as usual thai food is always the best!"
9,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious food for a good price. Make sure to ask for the homemade iced tea! It's really nice
10,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Very good Thai food with a great staff. Their panaeng is my go to take out for lazy days.
11,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Always fresh
Nice flavours, balance with the fish sauce.
Good curries. …"
12,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The best authentic Thai food in town served by lovely people. I’m genuinely happy that I live near this place. 5 stars all the way!
13,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Delicious dishes. The Thai visitors  appreciate the menu too ... a taste of Thailand is within reach.
14,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,a month ago,Very tasty food plus very friendly staff.
15,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Good Thai food, for a reasonable price, feels like an extended living room and can get a bit crowded and warm when it's packed but the service is friendly and the food tastes good."
16,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"This was one of our favourite Thai restaurants when we lived in Amsterdam.
The staff is very friendly. The restaurant has a homely and warm atmosphere.
My favourite is the Massaman curry! I ordered it every time. …"
17,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Always amazing!!!
If you are looking for nice, fulfilling, and chill dinner this is it. The place is not too crowded and service is always nice. All the crew are friendly and …"
18,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious, although I thought that the mix starter (9 euros) didn't have enough food (I normally eat a lot). As a main dish I had one of the curries, which I liked a lot (good amount and tasty). People working there are very nice as well."
19,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Dinner was great! I love spicy so for me it was good, but if you’re not up for that: skip the meals with 🌶 🥵 😉 Staff is friendly. I recommend this restaurant. The interior is cozy and casual."
20,Kratiam Thai, 2 stars ,a year ago,"Quality low compared to before. Does this place have a new chef or something? The beef of my beef Massaman was overcooked, tough and stringy. The Kra Prauw came with very little thai basil and as a result had little taste. Two stars because the third dish (Pad Phed) was actually pretty good."
21,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food! I had the fried rice with shrimp and it was delicious. However we were in a large group (8 people) and it took a while for them to bring our orders.
22,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Absolutely delicious Thai curries, my favourite Thai food place in Amsterdam and have returned many times after initial discovery many months ago :) highly recommend the red curry duck dish. Amazing friendly service as well, this place is worth travelling to. Warning they do not accept credit card, ( local) card payment only."
23,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Super friendly helpful staff. Simply delicious food, lots of great tastes. Comfortable, convivial, and warm atmosphere. Perfect portions. Everything was excellent really. I loved it and will be back very soon!"
24,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,a month ago,Best in amsterdam! Definitely recommend
25,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The best Thai restaurant in the city. The food is always good and the stuff is super kind and nice. Highly recommend the massaman curry and the fried rice, but TBH you can't go wrong everything is delicious."
26,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"A great place for Thai in the West - tasty food (and good portions), helpful staff and relaxed atmosphere. Only minus is that it's small and the kitchen is open so there can be a scent of ""fried"" in the air."
27,Kratiam Thai, 2 stars ,9 years ago,"Ordered a papaya salad (no papaya found and although taste was good, 11 euro seemed way overpriced) and a vegetarian dish, to take out. Food was ok, not spectacular and not a lot considering the price. Won't take out again, maybe return to eat in as the place is small and looks nice."
28,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,8 years ago,"I really dig the atmosphere and the food at this place. And I'm so glad something moved into this location, because it used to look pretty getto. So I'm really hoping that these guys pull through. The only thing is that they're prices are …"
29,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great service and delicious food. The duck curry and som tam are amazing. Everything we've had here is delicious. One of the best som tam's I've ever had. Tastes super authentic.
30,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,a year ago,The food is outstanding! Very close to the original Thai cuisine. Give this one a try!
31,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Excellent Thai food. Service however a bit slow and the food not served as hot as it should be (e.g. the soup was luke warm) probably because it was busy, but a well organized restaurant should be able to deal with that."
32,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,a year ago,Really tasty authentic Thai food. Fair price and friendly staff.
33,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"The food is really great, tasty, Really thai food. Great service, friendly. Drink was nice, really good cappuccino and thai Chang bier. Pity that I can’t pay with Visa & MasterCard."
34,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Great food and super friendly staff. A definite recommendation. I had the red curry with vegetarian spring rolls here; amazing!
35,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place. Delicious, fresh food. Only a few times carry out orders not precise. Maybe due to stuff being lost in translation."
36,Kratiam Thai, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"The ambient was clean and calm, the staff was friendly, but the food took too long to come. The price was ok, but the meal wasn’t nothing special."
37,Kratiam Thai, 2 stars ,9 years ago,Order tom yam kung. It smell no lemongrass and no keffir. The soup was very thin and to little vegetables that make the real tha-cousin.  Sorry I dont like it! The atsmophere in the restaurant was very good.
38,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Extremely courteous staff, very good food with decent prices. The interior and ambiance was very romantic. The massaman was amazing."
39,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Incredible kind staff, amazing food. The Keang Massaman kerrie is a must-eat!"
40,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Excellent Thai for great value, one of the top restaurants / takeaways in the area"
41,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Great thai food and nice friendly atmosphere. Only downside is the open kitchen: we always smell ""fried"" when we leave this place."
42,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Its not the best I had in my life but its pretty close to that,  and for me that's worth 5 stars, including, staff and deco and short time to wait  for the food"
43,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Had to wait sooooo long I almost got angry but the then the  food came and it looked so good and it was sooooo good , best Thai restaurant I ever had !!"
44,Kratiam Thai, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Nice Thai restaurant. Good food and nice service. Can be busy some nights.

46,Kratiam Thai, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"So good, it's not even funny anymore. My favorite dishes: Massaman curry (27) and Grilled duck curry (47)."

60,Kratiam Thai, 2 stars ,5 years ago,Not the best Thai restaurant i have been at. Food was not as I am used to get somewhere else. The price is too high for what you get.

82,Kratiam Thai, 3 stars ,a week ago,"This was my favourite in the area. Now chaotic and the food average. Kousenband became normal green beans, Thai basil is replaced with Italian basil, the sauce unrecognisable. Will give it another shot though and see whether it improves again"
