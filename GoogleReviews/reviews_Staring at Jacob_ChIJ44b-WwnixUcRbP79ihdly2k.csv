The seasonal juice (beetroot, apple and ginger) was so good too! Don‚Äôt forget to book your table on their website, this place is victim of its own success :)"
1,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"If you're looking for an American style brunch place, this is your spot. Portions are 'American sized,' flavor/quality isn't compromised and the service is fast! If you're looking to try this place on the weekends, you've got to book in advance, bit it's pretty easy to do so online"
2,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"One of the best breakfast spots that I‚Äôve ever tried. Everything was perfect. Starting from the cozy place, to the lovely stuff, and finally the food which was outstandingly delicious. We‚Äôve tried almost every item in the menu and all of ‚Ä¶"
3,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,a month ago,"I love love love the food. I recommend having the fried chicken for sure. I didnt like the cheese bacon egg skillet so much. I will skip that next time! I also tried the prawn tacos, I prefer the fried chicken!!"
4,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Super nice and friendly environment! Food is amazing and the staff is always smiling and helpful! Recommended for brunch but is better to reserve a place because it is always full! üòâ
5,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Ok so we went here on Sunday without a reservation and had to wait 40 mins for a table. We were about to leave but I am so glad that we stayed! We ordered the poached eggs with salmon, the fried chicken and biscuits, the french toast and ‚Ä¶"
6,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Been going to this place for three years and the quality and the service always remained on point. Don't let the waiting time scare you away. Get a reservation or simply wait by the lovely canal outside. The staff is always welcoming and the food is proper brunch deliciousness. They also have some killer bloody Mary's.
7,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Delicious brunch! Service was also super friendly and quick. Consider booking a table ahead, gets pretty busy!"

11,Staring at Jacob, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"The service was great and staff are super friendly, however, the food was bad. I ordered the egg hash and it was way over baked. Very dry and stiff. The salsa was also very watery and too sweet. I am disappointed that the food was so bad as so many Americans rave about this place."

13,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Service is really good and the food is amazing

19,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Staring at Jacob is a destination in itself, worth a detour wherever you are. Whenever I‚Äôm Amsterdam, I always choose this spot for brunch.

100,Staring at Jacob, 4 stars ,4 years ago,Portions are hefty and you'll leave feeling full. Try the dirty dirty. It's their version of a Bloody Mary.

We weren't acknowledged when we entered inside and waited by the bar to be seated, only to later realise there was a waiting list of names for a table, once the person who entered after us had placed his name on the list. Very annoying."
303,Staring at Jacob, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I loooooooved !!! The waiter was soooo kind and funny, the juices and the food very good and tasty... but I had to pay 3,75‚Ç¨ to add Halloumi (3 small slices of grilled cheese) and that is extremely expensive..."
