6,La Vaca Argentijns Grill, 1 star ,4 years ago,Low quality of beef if you pay 30 euro for a churrasco argentino you want really good beef. I had to go to an other restaurant... And the coke I think is from the bottle 1.5l...

13,La Vaca Argentijns Grill, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Good option to grab a steak or burger if you're out on the canals and find yourself getting hungry. The menu is solid, although fairly basic in terms of offerings, but the friendly staff and fair prices make up for it. And if you're having lunch, you might even catch one of their special deals."

17,La Vaca Argentijns Grill, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice place and convenient location. The best piece of meat they have, the ""medallion"" something, was served quickly and nicely prepared.
