1,SLA, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Coming from the US East Coast (NYC), I'm continuously impressed with Europe's vegetarian choices. Much more creative and more value than home. The bowl I created was ‚Ç¨8, and included 3 veggies, seeds, a protein, dressing, greens, and ‚Ä¶"

4,SLA, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"We love SLA so much üíóüíóüíó we visited 2 of their branches while we were in Amsterdam this May 2019. Here we ate once and enjoyed every second. Great vegan food, tasty and healthy. Loved their main dishes, smoothies and also cakes! Thank you very much"
5,SLA, 4 stars ,6 months ago,Nice and delicious i like it.
6,SLA, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Very well designed space with an exceptionally delicious healthy menu.
I had a tempeh bowl with sweet potatoes and lentils and it was filling but still fresh and perfectly balanced. Staff is friendly and very attentive.
Officially a SLA fan."

9,SLA, 5 stars ,4 years ago,The food is fresh and with a good bite to it. Just what I was craving for. Went for the green kimchi bowl. Great interior design too.

17,SLA, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Staff seemed a bit annoyed by our presence. Food was okay, not the freshest but still enjoyable. I‚Äòd say it‚Äòs good for a quick and healthy take-away, but nothing more. Reminded me of airport food or a bit more fancy version of dean&david."
18,SLA, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Delightful fresh, light lunch if you've had too much frites lately."
19,SLA, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent place for a quick health boost! Delicious fresh veggies with tasty hummus.

21,SLA, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely salads, great choice on the menu or you can even create your own. Very good vegan options. Good vibe!"
22,SLA, 2 stars ,4 years ago,We tried their own recipe salads (rather than mixing our own) and we were quite disappointed the combination of flavors was weird there was very little sauce/dressing and the soup was not helping the meal either. I highly suggest to stick to mixing your own salad from the ingredients that you know you love.
23,SLA, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Friendly reception. English spoken well (thankyou!). Very good soup indeed. And a deliciously dense bread. Very warm and calm atmosphere. Lovely place to chill. Will test the coffee in the morning :-))

26,SLA, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Delicious salad! A bit expensive, just like all this area. I paid 10‚Ç¨ but it was a really big and complete meal with spinach, quinoa, chickpeas, sweet potato, humus, temph, broccoli and a fantastic sause on the top (with ginger I guess). Vegan friendly and vegetarian too üòä"
27,SLA, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Best salads ever! Keep your quality and prices!
28,SLA, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Great place for the vegetarian hipster. There's one plate with chicken but aside from that, you have plenty of veggie options to fill up. Simple yet cozy atmosphere and generally helpful staff. The berry smoothie is a true winner."
29,SLA, 2 stars ,4 years ago,"I should've avoided this place after seeing that half of the lemons on the shelf with fruits were rotten and with mold, but still gave it a try. And there you go - food poisoning for me and another friend who was also eating a salad with ‚Ä¶"
30,SLA, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"My favorite salad place in the Netherlands! It's definitely a go-to place if you're feeling greased out from all the frites and bitterballen! I love that they have so many options and that you can create your own salad. Also, you can order off thuisbezorgd for free!"
31,SLA, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"All food is organic, you can have free water, it's organized in an intelligent way and it's certainly an healthy option. Kind of average taste and not really cheap, but still the best option vs fast food"
32,SLA, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Nice restaurant with great healthy food. Staff seems a little overworked, seems like they are under a lot of pressure to finish the salads as fast as possible... Maybe finish them a bit slower, stay calm and smile a little :). Lovely store nonetheless!"
33,SLA, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Great for a quick, healthy lunch salad.

39,SLA, 5 stars ,3 years ago,One of my go to places in Amsterdam. They serve different types of salades all made from homemade ingerients. If you're looking for something better than your Ceasars salad this is the place to be!
