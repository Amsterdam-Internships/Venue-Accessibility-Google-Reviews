48,In de Wildeman, 4 stars ,3 years ago,This is a cafe that so should have easily been 5 stars. Instantly looks Belgian and yet has the feel of a British pub. Extensive draught and bottled beer list. These are the reasons an otherwise 3 star bar is pushed to 4 stars. As lower ‚Ä¶

59,In de Wildeman, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Yes, it's a bit pricy, for I'm not used to   capitol city standards. However... the wide variety of beers and the knowledge and service of the staff makes me want to go back. The place is a kind of rudimentary and celebrates old times, not ‚Ä¶"

69,In de Wildeman, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"So many beers, so little time. Very knowledgeable staff happy to take time to get you the right beer."
70,In de Wildeman, 2 stars ,4 years ago,I ordered a Russian imperial stout from a local brewery. It tasted like it had been watered down with heavily chlorinated water- undrinkable. While I had never had this exact beer before I have had many other examples of this style and ‚Ä¶
