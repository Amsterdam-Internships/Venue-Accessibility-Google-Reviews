13,shah jahan, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Not a 5 star place. A four is a stretch. 3 is probably too low. So, you do your own math. Unless you are nearby, don't make a special trip."
14,shah jahan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Went all the way to Amsterdam with one of those discount coupon cards from a third party, after looking at a bunch of other options we finally decided that Having Indian would land us the best deal (price/ food ratio). And so..after ‚Ä¶"

51,shah jahan, 3 stars ,2 years ago,This used to be my favourite Indian restaurant in Amsterdam.  The quality has dropped a lot lately.  Takeaway dishes that used to fill the containers now only just fill the container half way and lack the flavour that made them so special. ‚Ä¶

57,shah jahan, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"4 stars means ‚Äúvery good‚Äù.  This place is very good.  Restaurant itself is quite small and simple, but the food quality and flavor is big.  I went with a group of 4 and we shared entrees.  All were quite nice.  And prices are reasonable. This would be a go-to Indian restaurant for me if I lived in the area.  Try it."

82,shah jahan, 4 stars ,a year ago,"Very good food, though we have only tried the Butter Chicken and Matter Paneer (because we keep getting it again, and again, and again).

83,shah jahan, 4 stars ,8 months ago,"Very good Indian Food, not too expensive in a super nice in Amsterdam"
84,shah jahan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Soooo delicious. I had very high expectations, and this place delivered. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, and it was great! The naan was also very good. One of the best Indian places I have tried. It was also not very busy (which I loved)."
85,shah jahan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Awesome restaurant, very good and decently priced food. I tried the chicken vindaloo and chicken madras - both were very good. Butter naan could be a bit more butter-y, but aside from that, all ok. Mango laasi is also very good. Fully recommend."

94,shah jahan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"It's the go-to place for good quality food without any second thought. If you are in Amsterdam and you are craving for Indian food, look nowhere else. Rates are reasonable too."
95,shah jahan, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Here are the reasons for the rating;
- service is too slow! We waited 40 minutes for food. 20 mins for our food to be packed, and 15 mins to get the bill and pay. ‚Ä¶"

99,shah jahan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,We stumbled across this little gem while we were on a walk. We ordered prawns for starters which came out promptly. The prawns were mouth watering and cooked to perfection - the spice blend used was of this world!  We had the lamb madras ‚Ä¶
100,shah jahan, 5 stars ,7 months ago,Outstanding food and brilliant service. Highly recommend!
101,shah jahan, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"An OK Indian place in Jordaan, but not my favorite in Amsterdam. Probably too many tables for the available space. The papadum appetizer tasted like prawn crackers, not sure if that's the intended flavor.  My chicken was a bit hard to bite."

103,shah jahan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food ## great hospitality

105,shah jahan, 5 stars ,4 years ago,My favourite Indian restaurant in Amsterdam.  Main chef and owner is Mr Singh from Kadhmir so very much a north indian experience.  The indian breads are all fresh made in the tandoor oven.  The peshwaris are particularly good.  Gets a bit ‚Ä¶

120,shah jahan, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Okeyish food, not at all as per what you order from the menu. In our personal experience Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Rezala were far from being authentic in any sense."
121,shah jahan, 5 stars ,a year ago,"We were four people we ordered
Mix grill, chicken tikka tandoori, paneer tikka & tandoori prawn was amazing, butter chicken was extremely exceptional ....."

129,shah jahan, 3 stars ,5 years ago,"The sauce was very oily. Unsure if it broke or that's how they like to make it. The flavors were there, and the naan and other things were good. But overall not my style for indian sauces."
130,shah jahan, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fabulous family run Indian restaurant. Top quality food in simply decorated establishment. We loved it.
131,shah jahan, 3 stars ,4 years ago,Situated on a nice street but was running short on staff which resulted in forgetting orders and a delayed service. Spice index was a bit misleading (two peppers = very hot) but the Chardonnay was tasty.
132,shah jahan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent Punjabi style restaurant. Price could be reconsidered to be a bit more lower. Authentic Punjabi food and other states Indian dishes.
133,shah jahan, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Some of the best samosas I've ever had. Meats were all tender and juicy while the naan was flaky, crispy, and buttery."
