0,Indian Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"I had the cheese naan, Lamd Jal Ferezi and a Mango lassi. The food was very tastefull, there was very nice Indian music playing, but it a bit too loud. It took a while to get our food."
1,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Today we were craving a delicious Indian meal, so we made a Goa dahl curry from South India.  We didn't have time to make naan bread, so we went to our favorite Indian restaurant, Indian Dinner on Surinameplein. Unfortunately they were …"
2,Indian Dinner, 3 stars ,3 years ago,We went here for a voucher. Restaurant is nicely said very basic. Service very slow. That’s why I give 2 stars less. However the food is really amazing. I wouldn’t come again this but order on thuisbezorg :)
3,Indian Dinner, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The food is good, staff is friendly but not very fast. Music can be very loud and inappropriate. Probably better to take away."
4,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best Indian I’ve had in Amsterdam! Actually best Indian food I’ve hand since I can remember! Great service too!
5,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Seriously the best Indian restaurant in Amsterdam! I tried many dishes from this place recently, and they keep impressing me. Add to that decent portion, good price and fast delivery. …"
6,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,7 months ago,"the delivery guy left the food on the ground in front of me as a reaction for making him wait what must have been less than a minute.He should be happy im leaving a 1 star review,i should have been kicking his teeth in for such a blatant act of disrespect and disregard to hygiene"
7,Indian Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great Indian food spot in the Baarsjes neighborhood. Ideally order ahead as food is made to order. Delivery is not always available but take away is a great alternative. The staff is from India and the food tastes the part. Prices are ok and combo meals are great deals for groups
8,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Really nice food. We ordered mix veg and it was accurately spiced. Very perfect for a homely dinner. Good work ! Also the delivery time was not much.
9,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Hands down best Indian restaurant offering delivery in Amsterdam! I've eaten here numerous times since moving to the city last year, and it's been good every time. Very nice staff as well!"
10,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Best paneer and garlic naan I've ever eaten! Huge amounts when take away, always friendly stuff there, totally recommend! ♥️"
11,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"We came in here with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised with how good the food was. Everything was great and the butter chicken was probably the best we have had in Amsterdam. It's sort of a tough location, kind of hidden off the road, …"
12,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst experience in ordering food. Ordered food at 18:15 in evening, after 1 hour got a call that delivery boy is late and food will be delivered in next 10 minutes. Half hour later got another call that the food is stolen and they need …"
13,Indian Dinner, 2 stars ,3 years ago,For the half price i paid it gets an ok minus rating for the food and service
14,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,2 years ago,"First of all this place cant be considered as a ""restourant"", as they indicate it.

15,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Absolutely diabolical service. I have never been spoken to with an attitude like that before. Arguing with customers after waiting 40 minuets for a simple order. Aggressive and ignorant and lack of product knowledge, cheese is not a …"
16,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Indian food taste is very close to what you get in india. The dine in has more food quantity against take away. You can swap nan for tandoori roti as all their dishes(veg/non veg) are accompanied by rice and roti. …
17,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Worst experience ever. The food was horrible and was not the thing that I ordered. After poiting it out the owner of this place started yelling at me and being rude, despite I was being polite. I paid the bill and left this place …"
18,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"BEST INDIAN FOOD IN AMSTERDAM! im seriously not joking, I'm from london and i've tried all the resturants in amsterdam.
Friendly staff! AMAZING POTIONS and GREAT TASTING food! …"
19,Indian Dinner, 4 stars ,a year ago,The food was good; the chicken was a bit dry but then again I’m not an expert on Indian food. Would recommend for those quarantining and looking for a good bite!
20,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,3 years ago,"STAY AWAY.........Never have I ever experienced anythin like this. They seemed lovely at first, we sat down, ordered our food, I ordered a vegetable dish, waited a very long time for the meals, then when they came there was cheese in my …"
21,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"AMAZING FOOD!!!!!
This is the first time I ever rate a restaurant but this one is worth it!
They delivered quickly, arrived still burning hot and was maybe the best Indian food I ever had. Thank you!"
22,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,a year ago,Ordered takeaway saag paneer which was flavour less - they must of forgotten the masala and the naans were thick and undercooked. Awful
23,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,3 years ago,Avoid at any cost! Never had people working in the horeca that rude. Delivery guy is agressive and rude and if you call to complain they simply cancelled your order cause they can't follow up what they are doing. I put one star cause I couldn't put zero. Just don't.
24,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I was  there together with 3 friends. Had 3 course of menu but the price was very reasonable compared to other places.really Love the restaurant atmosphere and amazing foods Despite one curry was  little more spicy.
25,Indian Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Good regular Indian food. Probably most of the business comes from delivery cause the restaurant was empty. The owner was also super friendly

30,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Our favorite Indian food for the last 18 months! We only order delivery, but they always arrive in half the time quoted, and have never gotten an order wrong once."

32,Indian Dinner, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Great take-out Indian feast, wish I discovered this place sooner. Large portions for the price too!"

34,Indian Dinner, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food at a very reasonable price. Not the best atmosphere but very clean and very nice and helpful staff.
35,Indian Dinner, 1 star ,3 years ago,This restaurant is a disaster - never order online from them. Instead of 35 min they tell you that it would take 65 min and then they deliver 2 hours later! It’s crazy that this can still happen in today’s world of competition...
