0,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,2 months ago,I have wanted a ramen bowl outside of Japan and Australia that packs a punch in terms of flavour and texture. Tokyo Ramen definitely delivers on both fronts! ‚Ä¶
1,Tokyo Ramen, 2 stars ,5 months ago,"Atmosphere and vibe is spot on for a Ramen joint. However the chicken in the ramen was either not cooked through, or just low quality chicken as it didn‚Äôt taste good. I went with the spicy chicken ramen which was a bit mono-flavour, with ‚Ä¶"
2,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Stumbled to this place by chance! Best ramen in Manchester, you can really tell everything is authentic and home-made. Noodles were freshly made, as well as the broth. Both delicious! ‚Ä¶"
3,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Best bowl of ramen I've ever had from a restaurant! The service was incredible and I will definitely be coming back :) ‚Ä¶
4,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Stumbled upon this place on TIK TOK (I know) and glad I did the service and food was great I struggled a little using the chop sticks but that's on me. The location is good to quite central to the city centre.
5,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Bliss  Best ramen I've had at any restaurant by far, great atmosphere and service. Thank you you have changed my life."
6,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,I really like their broth. I can smell their broth everytime I passed. Everything is so spot on.
7,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"We absolutely loved this place. The miso mushroom ramen was made vegan for myself, and was top notch when coupled with a peach hi-ball. Service was superb, very chatty and a sound guy. Can't wait to go back"
8,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great good and vibes, the staff really care about making you visit memorable, recommend the TanTan Ramen."
9,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 months ago,"The venue is only small but the ramen is mighty! Best ramen in Manchester. Be prepared to queue when it's busy, but the wait will be worth it. The menu is simple - four ramen and two side dishes when I visited - one of the ramen choices was vegetarian (the excellent mushroom-based Kinoko)."
10,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 months ago,Lovely selection of ramen and japanese drinks
11,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Best Ramen I've had outside of Japan. Very small menu with only 1 veggie/vegan option... But it was delicious so who needs choice!

16,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"WOW one of the best vegan ramens I've ever had. An amazing rich mushroom broth with loads of flavour! Quick service, friendly staff, banging tunes. Reusable chopsticks would be nice for future maybe, that's it. Recommend."
17,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,a month ago,"Enjoyable experience, nice simple however short menu, tasty ramen (shoyru). Will be going back to taste the rest."
18,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Coming from italy, tokyoRamen have the Best ramen of my life. Happy to have my first Manchester dinner here. Nice food, broth with amazing taste, fast service. Fried chicken good as the soup. Hope to be there one more time."
19,Tokyo Ramen, 2 stars ,4 months ago,"If only talking about food, the Ramen is tasty, it is a bit different from any other Ramen restaurants, I had the vegetarian Ramen, the soup base tastes nice and special, the firmness of the noodles was just right, it wasn‚Äôt too soft and ‚Ä¶"
20,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Manchester doesn't have a lot of ramen places but Tokyo Ramen takes the cake. The broth is thick but really tasty and the pork belly is to die for. Side dishes such as the octopus are good but a tad bit too pricey for the portion. The staff and kitchen crew are really friendly too!
21,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Tokyo Ramen In Manchester !

22,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 weeks ago,"Great service, great ramen - the one with crispy chicken was amazing! Thanks guys ‚ô•Ô∏è"
23,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Absolutely incredible food would recommend to anyone after an authentic ramen.
Service is top notch as well, janven is an absolute legend and makes you feel very at home during your time there.
Would 100% recommend!"
24,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"The menu is very short. Like, 4 types of ramen, 2 sides, and 4 drinks.
And that's how it should be. Every bowl of ramen is superb! I like the Tantan (fried chicken) bowl and the Kinoko (mushroom) bowl the most. ‚Ä¶"
25,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The ramen here was great! We got the shoyu ramen and the tantan ramen (pictured). The noodles were nice and the broth was very tasty! I‚Äôm not a huge fan of really spicy food but the level of heat in the broth was just right! Enough to ‚Ä¶
26,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"If you are looking for a ramen place in Manchester, this is a MUST. I'm yet to try the other dishes from the menu but I had the Shoyu ramen myself. Absolutely delicious. You can tell they make authentic broth, noodles are spongy and everything else is just on point."
27,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Kinoko ramen (veggie option) was incredible. The miso-mustard tare was a really unique and punchy flavour. The toppings were perfect for a mushroom lover: crispy enoki, pickled shiitake, and white shimeji mushrooms. ‚Ä¶"
28,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,AMAZING. great broth. these guys know what they are doing. gyoza were fine. thats literally the only part of the meal where i wish we had ordered more fried chicken and less gyoza. not really a bad item just the chicken was 10x better.
29,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Great place to have a good Japanese dinner. You can come in groups of 2-8 people and they'd still be able to put tables together for you. Prices are reasonable for ramen. Great selection of drinks as well - try Calpis!
30,Tokyo Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"The shop is small but pretty cool and the staff are friendly and welcoming. Personally in my humble opinion there is much to be had elsewhere in Manchester, having said that Ramen is a very personal dish so people might find the slightly lighter Tokyo broth more appealing."
31,Tokyo Ramen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not bad but there are issues. First the good: The fried chicken was the best dish we had there. It reminded me of karaage, crunchy and enjoyable. The chicken was served with some delicious sauces. ‚Ä¶"
32,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Its a very hip little place on Church Street, near Afflecks, Manchester. I had the Tantan Ramen which was great and full of flavour! The best part, it wad topped with fried chicken. A perfect meal to have on a very cold day. The service was great, Javen the server was very helpful and always smiling üòä"

35,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic customer service and food. I love their innovation and alterations to their ramen dish, even though the ramen and food isn't traditionally Japanese. I recommend trying their fried chicken."
36,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Lovely place. Small menu, great quality!"
37,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"If ramen in Japan is half as good as in Tokyo Ramen, then it's worth the visit! Absolutly amazing food, nice armosphere and solo-dining friendly :)"
38,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Fantastic ramen place, just what Manchester needed. Only a small menu with 3 ramen dishes on it and some sides, that's all you need though. Will 100% be visiting again. Broth very tasty and great noodles."
39,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,You have to appreciate the pared down menu. It promises a focus on the dishes and rapid service so that you can on your way to slurping umami heaven. ‚Ä¶
40,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Not many options where to choose from (just 4 types of ramen), but the food was really good. So 5 stars."
41,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Kinoko ramen was rich, moreish and satisfying"
42,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Nice broth but the tantanmen has a special scent of spice... wish they have tonkotsu ramen one day, also the noodles are a bit too firm for me... could be better if there‚Äôs a option of firmness in the menu so that people don‚Äôt forget to mention it"
43,Tokyo Ramen, 1 star ,3 months ago,"Just been there, really sorry to say that was horrible. We eat less that half meal and the waiter neither looked  our plates.
We've been asking for the bill for 20 minutes and when the waiter brought it to ‚Ä¶"
44,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!  Wonderful, friendly staff.  The food was excellent.  We went for lunch and the food was so delicious we returned again for dinner.  Can‚Äôt recommend this place enough.  One of the best meals we have eaten.  Certainly will be returning."
45,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,They use chicken bone broth so the broth is lighter than what I was expecting. I don't think it's a traditional style but it's a good meal.
46,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Decided to have a take away with the Mrs and we were blown away with the quality and rich flavours. the staff is very chill but attentive and caring, the food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable.
If you love ramen you need to try this place out."
47,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Amazing ramen, from the rich broth to the amazing toppings. Staff handed over the food with care, they were very friendly and we didn't have to wait long for the food. Would recommend for both price and quality."

49,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This was an accidental find when I was walking home from work. We tried it out a few nights later and fell in love. The food is absolutely incredible, the atmosphere is chill, and the staff honestly love their job. We definitely will be back ... and often."
50,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and service was really good.  Ramen was really good and place is small so I suggest going early or expect a wait.
51,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Lovely restaurant has great ramen, very well priced, lovely atmosphere"
52,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,I had an amasing unch. Fantastically efficient service that was un phased by anything. We where apologetically sat at the kitchen bar (in my opinion the best seats as you can see how things are done) I will be back.
53,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Absolutely fantastic ramen! Crispy chicken worked very well with the sesame base.
54,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Amazing customer service and very tasty food. It was quite a small menu but they always say keep a menu small so that you can always deliver good food. Service was very quick too. 10/10 would recommend and would visit again.
55,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Awesome place we visited during our first wedding anniversary. The staff where great and the food was top notch. Do not give them a miss.

60,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"One of, if not, the best ramen place in Manchester!

Also Janven is the man!"
61,Tokyo Ramen, 3 stars ,5 months ago,Ramen was slightly salty. Better ramen shops within Manchester at similar price points.
62,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"First time at Tokyo Ramen yesterday, small food menu but it was cooked to perfection. We had the beef to start and then the fried chicken Ramen. The man who served recommended both and it very much delivered. Great service. Fun place. We will be back."
63,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Probably the best ramen I had ever, great job guys!"
64,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Excellent ramen for a reasonable price. It‚Äôs rare I eat ramen outside of Japan but I‚Äôll be returning here for sure.
65,Tokyo Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"A nice venue and small menu, but wasn't really impressed by the ramen. Didn't have much depth of flavour, and the meat was rather plain. We had the pork belly and the chicken and both dishes tasted quite bland unfortunately."
66,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,7 months ago,"Best ramen in Mcr, with the real feel of a noodle house! Great service 100%, try the spicy ramen!"
67,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,a year ago,"the best service and the best ramen that I‚Äôve had. visited with friends and family each time i went into manchester before the lockdown and became my favourite place to eat, excited for when the restaurant opens back up"
68,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Very, very good ramen. I can't imagine it gets better in Manchester. Unpretentious, high quality, service with a smile and quick; I'm sad I live in London and won't be back any time soon - it's as good as any of the offerings there. ‚Ä¶"

72,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had a great time here. Very cosy place. Fantastic ramen and karaage.
73,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,It's ok but a bit pricey for ramen. The curry ramen I had was ok but needed more meat or seafood. The soft shell crab was nice but there needed to be a few more bit of seafood in there or even some meat. The pickled ginger in the dish was a ‚Ä¶

78,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,I had an amazing bowl of shoyu ramen topped with charred pork belly. The broth was very flavorful; ultimate umami and not too thick or too salty. The marinated egg was soft and sweet. Noodles still had bite to them. Definitely the best ramen in Manchester ‚ù§Ô∏èüçú
79,Tokyo Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Went here after reccomendation from a friend. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectation. I eat meat but my partner is veggie. Only one option for veggies, it's a bit limited. Our meal was nice, although wasnt much ramen for a veggie ‚Ä¶"

83,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Very small menu but excellent Ramens full of flavour. I would definitely recommend a visit to this Ramen house. Ramen is cooked perfectly and the different broths have very distinctive flavours.
84,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Super tasty shoyu ramen that's slightly sweeter than any other I've had before. Defiantly a nice change. The tantan that my wife has was also excellent. The sides we had were also amazing. The octopus was especially tasty, very high class ‚Ä¶"
85,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best Ramen places in Manchester. If you go, you have to try the pork Ramen, it's absolutely outstanding. ‚Ä¶"
86,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"All the ramen is made with chicken broth, which is less salty than pork broth. So if you want traditional, salty pork broth, this won't be the place for you. ‚Ä¶"
87,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Small but perfected menu with delicious ramen dishes (pork, chicken and veggie when I visited) that melt in the mouth. Decently priced costing around ¬£14-15 with a drink. Very much recommended."

90,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Minimalist seating and decor yet with a calm, homey feel. Attentive, friendly and knowledgeable staff. Menu short but plenty to choose from and the food, wow, it was delicious. If you're after pork bone broth, then this isn't the place for ‚Ä¶"
91,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Really good ramen and soft serve. Been here twice and Had the shoyu and tantanmen. Shoyu is sweeter than I‚Äôve had in the past but it‚Äôs very refreshing. The tantanmen has the perfect amount of spice to warm up to on a cold day. ‚Ä¶

We were celebrating my husband's new job so decided to pop in. Generous ‚Ä¶"
93,Tokyo Ramen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was unfortunate. My order was given to someone who came in 10 minutes after me and my partner had to wait as well as me for 15 minutes for my food, with her food in front of her. No new meal was offered for her while it got cold ‚Ä¶"
94,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Pretty good ramen. The broth is very good, although wasnt super impressed by the noodles. Will definitely go back though. It had a good friendly atmosphere, and the service was good."
95,Tokyo Ramen, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"If a bowl of ramen doesn't make you happy, it's bad ramen. The broth lacked any depth of flavour. Not at all to my liking but the flavour of the pork belly and  hardness of the noodles are on point."

100,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"I never leave reviews for places but felt like these guys seriously deserved it. From an over-critical hospitality way of thinking you can always pinpoint areas restaurants could improve but not here. The service, the food, the atmosphere and the playlist are all perfect. Absolutely mint place."
101,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Had the Shoyu Ramen. The broth was very tasty and the noodles were excellent. The service was great and the decor is fab. Will definitely be back üòãüôåüèªüçú
102,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,Super friendly people. Great food.
103,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Fantastic, the best ramen I've eaten in Manchester. Deeper flavour than shoryu and a healthier portion, limited menu but I think that's what makes it so good."
104,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly service, short but authentic menu and good ramen. Was a little on the small side portion wise but this was ideal for me as I can never manage all the broth at Shoryu!"
105,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 months ago,"Great food and customer service
Run by lovely people"
106,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Very tasty ramen. The sodas are a must.
107,Tokyo Ramen, 1 star ,3 years ago,Fairly poor effort of replicating the Japan iconic food. Literally nothing is right about the ramen served here. And also 2.50 pounds for a small cup of green tea is outrageous. Will never go again
108,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"One of the best Ramen I ever had! Simply as that! Wonderful! I like the place, the staff, the attitude, the music, and of course the food! WONDERFUL!"
109,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Huge Ramen fanatic, been too many establishments throughout UK, this is definitely one of the more authentic ramen shop around. ‚Ä¶"

112,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,One of the best ramen in town
113,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Loved everything about the place! Had shoyu ramen and some beef off a barbecue which was delicious. Prices are good as ramen is usually about 14 quid in other restaurants.
114,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Amazing Ramen! The best we can find in Manchester! We can't wait to bring the rest of the team. Great staff and friendly service! A must for vegetarians too!!

117,Tokyo Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Meh...
I guess it was a sign when I ordered green tea and got a cup of boiling water and a tea bag. Ramen was bland, I'd have been disappointed if I'd made it at home. Could really do better.  Service is good though."
118,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Absolutely delicious! Great quality. I didn‚Äôt really expect this. Well done guys keep like this. This is one of the best place to eat in Manchester and not spend much. Well done well done well done!!!!!!
119,Tokyo Ramen, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Not bad, the amount of meat is ok, but there is not very much veg. Also my egg was not cooked through, it felt cold compared to the broth and a good amount of the white was not solid."
120,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Brilliant! Staff are lovely, food has that personal touch, and o got to watch them make my meal which was delicious! Lots of flavour! Couldn't be happier  :)"

124,Tokyo Ramen, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was brilliant, nice atmosphere, great location. The crab was surprisingly nice, but a bit overpriced and somehow the ramen didn't hit the spot."
125,Tokyo Ramen, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Service was quick and food was good, only downsides were that portion was smaller than similar chains and they only serve chicken ramen as opposed to tonkotsu. Otherwise good."
126,Tokyo Ramen, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Delicious Ramen. Great for a quick lunch on your own or with a friend or two. Perfect rainy day comfort food.

142,Tokyo Ramen, 2 stars ,3 years ago,Food is excellent although the portions are on the small side. The rating is mostly for the ¬£3.75 charged for a glass of warm coke.

226,Tokyo Ramen, 2 stars ,5 days ago,"Decent ramen but crazy expensive for what it is. They don't even have pork broth ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The chef/manager should visit a place such as Nanban which for the same money serves truly exceptional stuff, or Koi which is much cheaper and definitely no worse."
