Servers were patient and kind and the food is delicious. …"
1,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"HIGHLY recommend grandma’s stew here- the beef was so tender and fall apart good! My husband enjoyed his pork cordon bleu too! The meat is what really shines in this place- I found the vegetables to be a little lacking in seasoning, but …"
2,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,5 months ago,"Big portion sizes, make sure you go empty stomach. The decor is very old school that's what I was looking for. The building was rebuilt 100 years ago and you can see it is pretty old. The surrounding buildings are 300 years old."
3,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Very cozy and tiny place with delicious Dutch cuisine! Waiters were great and very helpful! I really do recommend to plan a dinner there, when in Amsterdam - this place is truly unique!"
4,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,a year ago,A fantastic and authentic Dutch restaurant serving genuine Dutch fare. A small (and popular) eatery so I do strongly advise booking in advance. The decor is very rustic and homely. The menu is wide-ranging and very reasonably priced. My …

6,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Amazing atmosphere, delicious food, and amazing waiter (Nars)."
7,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,4 months ago,"Food is bad. We ordered soup and fish with vegetables. My husband and I thought the food was tasteless, without salt, the vegetables were overcooked, not crunchy, and some vegetables were wilted (maybe they were old). …"
8,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great staff, great food, great location.
Even though the waiters were understaffed this evening, they still managed to provide excellent, friendly service. …"

10,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Best one we tried in Amsterdam! Amazing traditional dishes, great deserts and the funniest waiter (in a good sense). They were also very accommodating with our many requests and recommended some great things from the menu."
11,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,4 months ago,The food Was amazing! We had the snails which we enjoyed very much. I can also recommend the creamy fish pot. The restaurants atmosphere is comfortable and the service is nice and fast.
12,Het Zwaantje, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Try to avoid this place if you can. The waiters were generally not friendly and slow, and one of them was actually quite rude. The food quality and taste were mediocre at best. There was nothing special about it. The the old stuff on the …"
13,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Had the traditional Dutch dish ""Grandma's Beef Stew,"" duck liver pâté, and snails in garlic butter. Slightly salty to my liking but very tasteful and rich. Waitress was very friendly and helpful, gave us free salad and fries too. Recommended."
14,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"Chose this restaurant and dish based on Alex Chew's review and she was not wrong.  Grandma's stew was excellent - very rich and tender, possibly the best beef stew I have had anywhere.  Accompanied by plate of interesting mixed vegetable dishes - red cabbage, baked onions etc.
Reccommend."

The accompanying veggies were perfectly cooked. The Apple sauce was spectacular. Also ordered the cordon blue, which was amazing. Fries and salad were normal fries and salad."
17,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"This was a recommended place by our host (local). Indeed, it's more local restaurant with nice ambience. Service was good and we're lucky not waiting for a table at peak time of 19:30. Food was delicious but roasted potatoes were not tasting like a fresh and lamb was little chewy (1 of 3 pieces). Prices are affordable."
18,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The service is great, the place is cozy, very romantic... the food is delicious, we recommend the specialities from the menu, pork and ribs are the best!! Beer and deli wine!!! 2 people 47€ with tip."

23,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Interesting decor (eg. carpets as table cloths), good food in very large portions. The only thing is that service can be a hit or miss - 2 of our waiters were great the other one - not so much."
24,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Great food with that traditional homemade feel. Our company ordered 4 different meals and everyone was really happy with how they tasted.
25,Het Zwaantje, 3 stars ,4 months ago,Great comfort food but very busy. Owner was in too much of a hurry to get a high turnover on his tables. Sateh sauce was dry and smothered the meat that was underneath
26,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"We went to have dinner and it was lovely. They didn't have anything vegetarian on the menu but offered to make some things specifically for my vegetarian friend. That's what I call exceptionally good service. The soup was great, followed by …"
27,Het Zwaantje, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"It's good that this was open on Christmas day, however I guess people were not very happy to work on that day and they were showing it. Unfortunately, it took an hour for food to come. The portions were really big and taste was above average but nothing special really."

31,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Waited an absolute age to get a table here, despite booking. Didn't care by the end, the food is absolutely unbelievable. This restaurant singlehandedly rescues the reputation the Dutch have for bland food. The waiting staff are incredibly …"

43,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"I have been a regular visitor to the Zwaantje (The Little Swan) ever since its opening night some 44 years ago and every occasion has been a delightful experience. Something akin to a cozy living room, the restaurant has remained in a time …"

51,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 months ago,"Great food, so nice atmosphere and the service was awesome."
52,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Good for eating something local. I ate there with my girlfriend, when we arrived the waiter asked us if we wanted some gin (?) but the meal was super good, a lot of food. My gf got a soup and together we spent 30 euros."

58,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,a year ago,Always a solid. ‘t Zwaantje has been around for literally decades. The food is excellent. Some typically Dutch dishes that taste better than the way my Gran and my Mom used to make them (and they both could cook!) Excellent friendly service …

60,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,The food was great! It was full but didn't feel crowded.
61,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,I've been to Amsterdam twice and this is simply the restaurant that's on my must-visit list. The food here if phenomenal no matter what you have and the staff is so friendly. I can't recommend the beef stew enough. It's a healthy portion …
62,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Some colleagues recommended this restaurant for dinner and it was a hit with our group.  Amsterdam has many good restaurants of various cuisines and this place is a great place for ""local"" Dutch cuisine.  Not only was the food fantastic and plentiful, but the staff is very friendly and attentive."
63,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,We popped in here for some food on our arrival in Amsterdam... it was 10:30pm on a Sunday night and we were made very welcome.  It's very cosy - there are rugs on the table :-) …
64,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Probably the best meal we have had in Amsterdam.   It isn’t on the web guide sites but should be.  However, it is already packaged, so giving it any more people may not matter.  Book reservations early as they fill up quickly.  Beef stew …"

68,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,6 months ago,"Great experience...delicious food, friendly and leisurely service, loved the atmosphere."
69,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,2 years ago,"The food is simply not good. Obviously the cheapest ingredients are used, to make overly simple dishes with no taste. Portions are big, yes, but tasteless and quite fat too... Not worth the price at all. Honestly i think most of the raving …"
70,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Grandma’s beef stew - an absolute killer. It takes a while to be served but it’s definitely worth waiting!
71,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Excelent service, environment, food, fair price, had the stewed meat specialty and finished with a wonderful apple pie."
72,Het Zwaantje, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"This is a cute little bustling place with very personable wait staff, but the food, to be honest, is fairly pedestrian. The smoked eel was delicate and delicious, though not extraordinary. The lobster bisque just didn't have what it takes, sadly. Really enjoyed the wine and the relaxed and friendly waiters though."
73,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Amazing restaurant in Amsterdam! I recommend to everybody

77,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"This is amazing. The food is just delicious and the staff can't do enough to help. Having been pregnant I was possibly a picky customer, however the staff were so accommodating and super helpful.
Grandma's stew is  to die for."
78,Het Zwaantje, 2 stars ,2 years ago,"Really surprised about the ratings of this restaurant . Service is reaaaaally slow (we had to ask for the menu after 15 minutes waiting on our table). We took two traditional plates , and nothing was exceptional ... mashed potatoes without …"
79,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,7 months ago,"Food was good but not amazing, i had the schnitzel. Hardly any vegetarian options though so not for veggies:)"
80,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Nice service, nice food, but if you are not a vegetales lover, don’t ask for the traditional plate."
81,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,2 years ago,Service took forever. No water. No check up. The mediocre food took a long long time to come out. When we went in we were told we'd have a table in 10 minutes. It took 30 minutes to get a table. When we sat down finally we had soup but then …
82,Het Zwaantje, 3 stars ,2 years ago,Food was ok. Veggies were overcooked.  The steak needed seasoning and the chicken was tough. Potatoes were good though with the mayonnaise. Lots of food to eat with refills on the veggies & potatoes. Dirty rugs on the tables. Staff were ok. …
83,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,5 years ago,"Real Dutch food. Great service. If you want to have carpet on your table, go there."
84,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"The food was prepared with care. The beef stew was the best I have ever had and quite welcome on the chilly, drizzly night we had gone. The coffee was excellent. If I am ever back in Amsterdam this will be on my for sure list of restaurants of which to return."
85,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Went on a busy Saturday night and were lucky to grab a table just as other customers left. The staff were friendly, the restaurant’s decor was tired but not in a negative way - it was very cosy and felt quite authentic. There was a good …"
86,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Rude staff, probably prejudice refused to get us a table. the restaurant was 1/2 full and it was still 6 PM. The restaurant closes 11 so they could have given us the option to wait or return later but he just told us they were full, 9 …"
87,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We had a lovely dinner, visited because my boyfriend wanted to try the mussels - they were just out of this world he said. We also tried the Rolled sole - was a great choice, especially the sauce was delicious. Friendly service, you are not rushed to spoon your food quickly. And the decor is great by the way :)"
88,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Fabulous traditional Dutch food: their fish stew & their beef stew is very good. Desserts are also not to be missed. Bottled IPA from a local brewery is exceptional. Highly recommended.
89,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,a year ago,Food and vibe was alright. The mussels are good.
90,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Stumbled upon this lovely restaurant while exploring the centre. The restaurant itself has a very cozy atmosphere and feels very authentic.

Would definitely go again"
92,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Enjoyed the food, the soup was awesome!"

94,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,7 years ago,"Small and cozy restaurant with gracious and kind (family) staff and owners.  Food is traditional Dutch -- many well crafted fish dishes.  Oma's Recipe never disappoints, and the mussel dish is are generous and perfectly cooked. Chicken in a pot is another favorite.  Generous portions, reasonably priced!"
95,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"OMG-can’t say enough good things about this restaurant. We live in USA (no we didn’t vote for “you know who”) and visit this wonderful restaurant every time we are in Amsterdam. We fiat came in 1999, and have been back at least 10 times. …"
96,Het Zwaantje, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Very dissapointing after the good reviews I read. They served the food exactly one hour after we ordered. The portions were big but the taste was nothing special. They could have replaced the ""rugs"" they use for table cloth a long time ago. They seem dusty and disgusting."
97,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Go here if you visit Amsterdam. It’s recommended by locals and every time I visit I always make sure to make a reservation here. Amazing stew and the best mussels I’ve ever had in my life!
98,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice cozy place to eat with great Dutch specialties, large portions and reasonable prices. Escargot are great. Grandma's beef stew is awesome."
99,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,"Dutch food specialized, in a well decorated place. Don t forget to leave a card of yours in the wall."
100,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"We have been traveling all week and had good food, but craved a real ""meat and potatoes"" comfort food dinner. Popped in on a rainy and cold Saturday night and were seated. Almost walked out because it too a while for them to take our order. …"
101,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Super rude. Didn't even eat or get settled. The guy working had a dirty look permanently on his face and didn't even look at us as he snorted ""drinks only at the bar!"" after my wife asked if we could sit at a table. The place was empty by …"
102,Het Zwaantje, 3 stars ,4 years ago,"Honestly don't get the hype. The food was decent Dutch food, but there's something about the atmosphere that I just couldn't get past; there are old carpeted floors and literal carpets as table cloths that look like actual old rugs that …"
103,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Nice food. I would recommend making a reservation because it gets very busy on weekends. If you don't you'll be waiting at the bar for roughly 20 mins before ordering, but the food is worth the wait."
104,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,3 years ago,"Unfortunately only the atmosphere was ok. The tables are covered with used rugs as decoration, the traditional Dutch dish  stamppot was truly disappointing. The carrots were tasteless, and the potatoe mash was mixed with raw onion pieces, …"
105,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Great food and very helpful and friendly staff..
106,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Stopped by after reading some online reviews...well worth the walk. Definitely suggest the cold appetizers: smoked eel, smaoked salmon and the pate, all were excellent. For dinner we all got the beef stew which was perfect for the rainy chilly night!"
107,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 years ago,"Amazing quality food, service and after practically tasting everything on the menu I can say that the must eat are the escargot, schnitzel, mussels and of course omas recipe! Need to visit it at least 1 a month and have taken all my tourist friends here.. top."
108,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,2 years ago,Ordered Mussels + Fry's which came with a garden salad. Had to ask for the frys and salad never came.  Mussels were to be cooked in white wine but broth tasted more like dishwater. Server was sorry but no compensation on bill. Horrible meal.
109,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,4 months ago,"Great food, great location and great staff"
110,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"The interieur, menu and host are typically dutch. The food (I had 'Oma's suddervlees' for €17,50) is definitely good, but I might have eaten better and in the same time less expensive dutch food at other places. However, combined with the relaxed, comfortable and warm atmosphere and the friendly host it is definitely worth it."
111,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,5 months ago,Great place. Nice waiters
112,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Poor hygiene...

We went there to try some traditional Dutch dishes. …"
113,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,Traditional Dutch restaurant serving good old Dutch food. Right in the middle of Amsterdam. Prices are reasonable and service was not bad. Portions are decent to fill one up.
114,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Our go to place for good dutch food. I love the beef stew there (Oma's recipe) and really good mashed potato variations. I would say it is a should not miss when you are in the Nine Streets.

116,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"ℹOnion soup is very good.The Grandma's Dutch Stew is very tasty👍.
🍷Good selection of wines from Spain, South Africa.
Expect a waiting queue due to popularity ;)"
117,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,5 years ago,Excellent Dutch food (but heavy on the seafood so be warned) in very cozy atmosphere. The only disadvantages - they don't serve tap water (against the law in NL) and it feels a bit crammed)...
118,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,"Amazing traditional restaurant. Portions are very big and atmosphere is great. It gets very busy, you need a booking if you want to go."
119,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Very rude bartender, i was asked to leave the place if I’m not ordering food, even though I ordered a lot to drink. Don’t know whether that’s racism, or just rudeness, but I’m definitely not coming to this place again. I expected more hospitality from Dutch people🙁🙁🙁"
120,Het Zwaantje, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"Friendly and good value restaurant. Grandma 's stew was excellent. Interior was a little odd and maybe not everyone's taste, but worth a visit if your looking for something a bit different."

134,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Dont know if it's a Dutch thing, but service was pretty lousy.  Waiter was not nice and rude.  I understand that you dont really want to be there but if you're in the service industry... Food was not that great either."
135,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Very nice stuff!! The Dutch food was delicious!! All in all a must visit in Amsterdam!
Thanks for having us!"
136,Het Zwaantje, 1 star ,4 years ago,"Wanted a table for two, waiter tried to put us in corner next to large party of 8 but no room when we asked for amother table he tried to put us at an unmade table next to the kitchen then walked away, a very rude person so we walked out. Do not go to this place you won't be made welcome."
137,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,2 years ago,The atmosphere food and staff in this place are amazing .. it's a must if your in Amsterdam but maybe book a table in advance as it is very popular .
138,Het Zwaantje, 5 stars ,6 years ago,"Nice little spot in the 9 streets area. The place was cozy and the staff was nice, but the food is why they get 5 stars. Get the fried muscles,  trust me. They are delicious."
