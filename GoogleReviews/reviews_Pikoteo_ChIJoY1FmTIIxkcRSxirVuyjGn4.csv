0,Pikoteo, 2 stars ,5 months ago,The restaurant is well located and has an original decoration. The food however was not what I expected. The chef is Spanish but it didn't seem like Spanish food to me. ‚Ä¶
1,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,a week ago,"Yesterday we where at Pikoteo. It was our first time there, we where celebrating the birthday of my boyfriend. I chose this place after reading all the good reviews and because it was dog friendly. We have an adorable French bulldog Pierre. ‚Ä¶"
2,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,8 months ago,"Very nice, just came across it while heading to the ferry and decided to have a beer on the sunny terrace.. after checking their menu also decided to try their hand chopped steak tartare and it was indeed a very good decision.. will come back soon for sure to try their other tapas.."
3,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,a year ago,"Had an amazing birthday meal out here, really enjoyed both the cocktails and food. The salad with celery sorbet dressing was a highlight! Very friendly service and great terrace for soaking up the evening sun."
4,Pikoteo, 2 stars ,9 months ago,"Interesting flavors but really overpriced, and I was still hungry in the end, after spending 35‚Ç¨/person. I will not come back and don't recommend the place."
5,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,4 months ago,Really great food place and service. Spanish tapas with a Spanish head chef but with fusion flavours and twists - we absolutely loved the combinations. Really top quality ingredients freshly prepared. We visited on a rainy evening when it was cosy and buzzy inside but must be lovely in the sun on the water too.
6,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,2 years ago,Best food experience in Amsterdam. Not the ‚Äúusual‚Äù restaurant but something different with really good combination of food. We tried basically everything and we came back for another time in the same week. Star of the evening was the ‚Ä¶
7,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Great food - it's got really great flavour with lots of local ingredients. Very well noted allergens too. Nice quiet location - although not your classic charming architecture. Not super cheap either but top quality food.

11,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,6 months ago,Delicious Spanish food with a modern fusion touch. It is nicely located next to a canal and the staff is friendly. A place to go back to! Prices on the medium to high range.
12,Pikoteo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Just enjoyed our dinner here with 7. Good food, friendly personnel and casual atmosphere. Especially the orangery is cozy. Crayfish ceviche üëç Price wise it's a bit on the expensive side, but worth it."
13,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"A really fantastic and modern take on tapas. The dishes were super inventive and thoughtful, with taste and flavour at the forefront, while the staff were a pleasure to converse with. Cocktails were absolutely delicious as well.

Will go again!"
17,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,10 months ago,"Delicious food, friendly staff with a great service! Highly recommended. Great location to have a drink net to the canal and enjoy the nice weather outside! Unfortunately, due to Covid the visit had to be limited which is understandable! Apart from that, nothing to complain about."
18,Pikoteo, 4 stars ,4 years ago,"Well thought servings and great combinations of flavors. Definitely try the Johnny bravas and the manana manana ribs. Only complaint was the service, we felt like the staff had forgotten we were there at times but to their credit, it was very busy. They were very polite and knowledgeable."
19,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,4 years ago,Really cool tapas with Asian mix. You can order pigeon or tuna or bread or chicken. The variety is wide and always some fancy stuff on the menu. I really like it and you should give it a try even though the prices for one plate are between ‚Ä¶

35,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,"Amazing food in one of Amsterdam most beautiful hidden gem! I can highly recommend for food lovers, especially those of us that love fusion! Although I must say the service and attitude can be better, seems like they are severely understaffed, only one for the terrace by the water and one for inside (where we were)."

Also good service and reasonable prices."
49,Pikoteo, 4 stars ,2 years ago,"Very good food. It‚Äôs tapas so small potions, which are each the price or full meals so it‚Äôs a bit pricey. Good service compared to most restaurants in Amsterdam. Great view."
50,Pikoteo, 4 stars ,3 years ago,"It‚Äôs a great place for friends and family to hang out. Great chef, excellent meal and perfect cocktails. Nice view of the canal and great security and service. One of the best places to be."
51,Pikoteo, 2 stars ,2 years ago,This restaurant is almost never open.  On the one time it was open we asked to sit on the patio.  I was not very busy and there were at least 3 waiters. Despite that we waited 15 minutes and were not offered a menu or order while we could see them chatting away. We left and I doubt they even noticed. Avoid.
52,Pikoteo, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Food was moderate. The lamb shops were very very fat. Although the waiter was very polite, he only noted down one desert and we had to wait for the second one for almost half an hour."
53,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,a year ago,Good wine and amazing squid and pulpo! Finally a good restaurant in Amsterdam with good service and real taste! Defo I will come back!

60,Pikoteo, 3 stars ,3 years ago,"Good food, but service could be better. A blonde lady was pretty rude and it took a long time before she finally came to my service, despite her seeing me seeking her attention."
61,Pikoteo, 5 stars ,3 years ago,Very nice spot in the city for Spanish food. The place is nice although the terrace could get improved and to be more clean. Most of the staff is nice
