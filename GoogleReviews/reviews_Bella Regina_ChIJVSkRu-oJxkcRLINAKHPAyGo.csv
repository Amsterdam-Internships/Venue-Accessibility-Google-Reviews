0,Bella Regina, 5 stars ,a month ago,"We came 3 days out of 6 and the food was amazing, the man does anything he can to help and make your experience wonderful. I highly recommend it! The steak was beautiful and is reasonably priced"
1,Bella Regina, 3 stars ,2 years ago,"Well, it's pizza. Here, you're paying for friendly staff and the location. The food is alright. It seems mainly fresh but not high quality. My friend had the seafood pasta, it was alright. I had a vegetarian pizza. They were friendly enough …"

3,Bella Regina, 1 star ,2 years ago,I have asked for chicken pasta plate. The food presentation wasn't very good but the taste was almost good. My friends asked for a steak plate and it was awful. They weren't able to eat anything. It was really disgusting. The wine didn't …
4,Bella Regina, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"The margarita was similar to pizza I had in Sweden, so not a typical Italian pizza but better because the cheese has more flavour than mozzarella."
5,Bella Regina, 3 stars ,a year ago,"Great pizza, alright pasta. The portion sizes are very big, you may want to share. The prices are reasonable and the tiramisu was very good. The owner may come across unfriendly, but it's a language barrier. He is actually a nice man. Group of 5 and we all enjoyed our meal. Nothing super special, but good food."

8,Bella Regina, 2 stars ,3 years ago,"Well. This place is filthy. The floors, the chairs, the ceiling are all like they haven't been renovated for decades. The food was not that great but not that bad either. The atmosphere was awful. The personnel was decent although there were no other people to serve. Keep away as there are better solutions near the restaurant."

15,Bella Regina, 1 star ,2 years ago,"Would not recommend this place at all. The owner was very rude to us, we had only just finished our meals and were waiting to order desert and more drinks when he shoved the bill in our face, he made us pay and kicked us out well before we were finished. Do not go here if you like to take your time and enjoy your meal"

213,Bella Regina, 5 stars ,3 days ago,"Vandaag lekker uiteten geweest bij Bella Regina in Amsterdam Centrum met m’n lieve vriendinnetjes. Het eten was echt heerlijk! We hebben genoten van onze spaghetti en pasta’s, maar er was nog veel meer keus. Het personeel is heel vriendelijk en ik ga daar zeker weer een keertje eten als ik in Amsterdam ben. Zeker een aanrader!"
