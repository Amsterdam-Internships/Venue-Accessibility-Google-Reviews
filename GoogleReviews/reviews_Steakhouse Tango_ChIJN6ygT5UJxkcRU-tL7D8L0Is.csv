1,Steakhouse Tango, 1 star ,6 months ago,"Bad quality of meat, can't recommend this place, tourists trap outside of tourist hotspot. Just look at the right corner of the picture of the ""rib-eye""-steak.."
2,Steakhouse Tango, 4 stars ,6 months ago,"The food was good and not overpriced. The waiter was incredibly nice, fast and attentive.

5,Steakhouse Tango, 4 stars ,4 months ago,"The food was good but a little overpriced.
